      "abstract": "\n \n \n Progress in clinical trials and drug development for paediatric perianal fistulising CD (pfCD) depends upon accurate, reproducible imaging to assess disease activity and measure treatment response. We evaluated the inter- and intra-rater reliability of existing radiologic disease activity indices and anatomical classification systems previously identified as appropriate for assessment of paediatric pfCD.1\n \n \n \n A retrospective cohort (N=50) of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exams representing a full spectrum of paediatric (<18 years) perianal CD severity was selected by a single expert paediatric radiologist. Methods described by Zou2 were used to estimate sample size. Three separate radiologists (2 paediatric) blinded to clinical information assessed pfCD in the exams using the Magnetic Resonance Novel Index for Fistula Imaging in CD (MAGNIFI-CD), Van Assche Index (VAI), modified VAI (mVAI), Paediatric MRI based Perianal Crohn’s disease (PEMPAC) index, a visual analogue scale (VAS) of overall pfCD disease severity (range, 0-100 mm), as well as with the Park’s and St. James University Hospital anatomic classification systems. Two radiologists read all exams twice, separated by 2 weeks, and 1 radiologist read the exams once (250 total reads). Intra- and inter-rater reliability was evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC; equivalent to weighted kappa). Precision of the ICC estimates was quantified with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) obtained using clustered bootstrapping. Degree of reliability was interpreted with benchmarks proposed by Landis and Koch3.\n \n \n \n Median age of children was 13.5 years (IQR 11.4-16.1), and 64% were male. Median Paediatric Crohn’s Disease Activity Index score at time of imaging was 17.5 (IQR 10-32.5). Substantial (ICC>0.61) inter-rater reliability was observed for MAGNIFI-CD, VAI, and mVAI (Table 1), with the highest ICCs observed for the mVAI (0.72 [0.6 to 0.79]). Moderate (ICC>0.41) inter-rater reliability was observed for PEMPAC, St. James University Hospital classification, and the VAS, and fair (ICC>0.21) inter-rater reliability was observed for Parks classification. Intra-rater reliability was nearly perfect (ICC>0.81) for the VAS, and substantial for all indices except for Parks classification, which had moderate (0.60 [0.44 to 0.75]) intra-rater reliability (Table 1).\n \n \n \n Most existing multi-item MRI-based disease activity indices and the St. James Hospital classification were reliable for the assessment of paediatric pfCD in our cohort. Our preliminary results suggest that the disease activity indices may have utility to measure treatment effect in paediatric pfCD clinical trials.\n \n \n \n 1.Crowley E, Ma C, Guizzetti L, Zou G, Lewindon PJ, Gee MS, et al.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nThere is no validated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) index for assessment of perianal fistulas in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). We developed and internally validated a new instrument.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe used paired baseline and week 24 MRI scans from 160 participants in a randomized placebo-controlled trial of stem cell therapy for patients with perianal fistulizing CD. Four radiologists scored disease activity using index items identified during previous studies and exploratory items. Reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients. We developed an index using backward elimination linear regression analysis in which potential independent variables were items having intraclass correlation coefficients of at least 0.4 and the dependent variable was perianal fistulizing disease activity, measured on a 100 mm visual analogue scale. The final model was internally validated using the .632 bootstrap method to correct model optimism and quantify calibration accuracy. We evaluated responsiveness of the index by assessing longitudinal validity and estimating standardized effect sizes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe developed the magnetic resonance novel index for fistula imaging in CD (MAGNIFI-CD) using 6 items. The optimism-corrected R2 of the model was 0.71, which was comparable to R2 for the original sample (0.74). The calibration slope for the model was 0.98. Compared with the original and modified versions of the Van Assche index, the MAGNIFI-CD had improved operating characteristics. Estimates of intraclass correlation coefficients for MAGNIFI-CD, the modified Van Assche index, and Van Assche index were 0.85 (95% CI, 0.77-0.90), 0.81 (95% CI, 0.74-0.86), and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.71-0.86) for intra-rater reliability, and 0.74 (95% CI,0.63-0.80), 0.67 (95% CI, 0.55-0.75), and 0.68 (95% CI, 0.56-0.77) for inter-rater reliability. Corresponding standardized effect size estimates were 1.02 (95% CI, 0.65-1.39), 0.84 (95% CI, 0.48-1.21), and 0.68 (95% CI, 0.33-1.03).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe developed an index, called the MAGNIFI-CD, based on 6 items. It assesses MRI data and determines perianal fistulizing CD activity with improved operating characteristics compared to previous indices. This index may be used as an outcome measure in clinical trials comparing treatment effects in patients with perianal fistulizing CD. Although the performance of the MAGNIFI-CD indicates its stability and reasonable external validity, external validation is needed.",

      "abstract": "Background: Perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease (CD-PAF) is difficult to treat, and several MR scoring systems have been developed to assess treatment response. Objective: To assess the relationship between CD-PAF MR scoring systems and radiologists' subjective assessment of CD-PAF severity and treatment response on baseline and follow-up pelvic MR. Methods: Retrospective single institution study of consecutive symptomatic patients with CD-PAF patients who underwent pelvic MR before and [≥]3 months after initiating biologic therapy during a 10-year period (December 2011 to December 2021). One of four radiologists interpreted baseline and follow-up MRs. Scoring systems included variables in the modified Van Assche index (mVAI), magnetic resonance novel index for fistula imaging in CD (MAGNIFI-CD), and pediatric MR-based perianal Crohn's disease (PEMPAC) index. For initial and follow-up MR, a 5-point Likert scale assessed severity (1=mild, 3=moderate, 5=marked). On follow-up MR, radiologists evaluated fistula response as 1-improved, 3-stable, or 5-worsened CD-PAF severity. All four study radiologists scored the baseline MR in 20 patients to calculate inter-reader agreement statistics. Interrater reliability was assessed with the Krippendorff coefficient for categorical variables and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for continuous variables. Results: The final cohort included 96 CD-PAF patients (50 men; mean age=33.0 years) with 192 baseline and follow-up MRs. Moderate to substantial agreement was observed among radiologists for MAGNIFI-CD, mVAI, PEMPAC, and Likert scores (ICC: 0.716, 0.756, 0.535, and 0.679 respectively). Individual components of MR scoring systems had Fair to Substantial agreement (Alpha: 0.195 to 0.730). Significant univariate associations were found between MR scoring systems and radiologists' Likert severity assessments (p<0.001, Pearson correlation coefficients [≥]0.820). In patients meeting criteria for change in disease severity (n=17), all scoring systems demonstrated AUC values [≥]0.93. Conclusion: The MR scoring systems for CD-PAF (MAGNIFI-CD, mVAI, and PEMPAC) demonstrated strong associations with radiologists' subjective assessments of severity and treatment response on baseline and follow-up pelvic MR. Inter-reader agreement of these scoring systems outperformed individual MR factors.",

      "abstract": "\n \n \n Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold-standard for evaluating Crohn’s perianal fistulas. Multiple scoring indices to grade radiologic disease activity severity have been established, with limited comparative data and a lack of consensus regarding which index correlates most accurately with clinical findings. In a prospective MRI series, we explored the relationship between established radiologic indices and clinical healing.\n \n \n \n Serial MRI scans from 60 adults with Crohn’s perianal fistulas enrolled in a prospective study were acquired. The prospective study evaluated the efficacy of a protocolised treatment strategy optimising care delivery at a single tertiary centre. Patients had ≥12 months follow-up with serial MRI performed annually. Each MRI scan had a paired physical examination, with clinical healing defined as the absence of externally draining perianal fistulas and no seton. MRI scans were reviewed by a specialist radiologist blinded to clinical findings. Radiologic disease activity severity was graded using the Van Assche Index (VAI), Magnetic Resonance Index for Assessing Fistulas in Patients with Crohn’s Disease (MAGNIFI-CD) and Fibrosis Score (FS). The primary endpoint was the relationship between radiologic indices and clinical healing. Secondary endpoints included the optimal index scores for clinical healing and the relationship between individual scoring criteria and clinical healing.\n \n \n \n A total of 135 MRI scans were acquired. All patients had baseline imaging, with 88% and 37% having serial imaging at 1 and 2 years, respectively. The median interval between baseline and final MRI was 16 months. Clinical healing significantly correlated with less severe radiologic disease activity, reflected by lower VAI (OR 0.70, P<0.001), lower MAGNIFI-CD (OR 0.76, P<0.001) and higher FS (OR 3.14, P<0.001). On ROC curve analysis, all radiologic indices exhibited a similarly high degree of correlation with clinical healing; AUROC of 0.91, 0.84 and 0.92, respectively (Figure 1). The optimal index scores for clinical healing were VAI ≤6 (sensitivity 83%, specificity 94%, AUROC 0.88), MAGNIFI-CD ≤8 (sensitivity 78%, specificity 73%, AUROC 0.75) and FS ≥5 (sensitivity 83%, specificity 94%, AUROC 0.88). On multivariable logistic regression analysis, increasing degree of fibrosis on FS (OR 2.68, P<0.001) and increasing fistula tract extension on VAI (OR 0.09, P<0.001) were independent positive and negative indicators of clinical healing, respectively.\n \n \n \n Radiologic disease activity severity using established scoring indices have equally strong correlations with clinical healing of Crohn’s perianal fistulas.

We developed prediction models for anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) treatment failure in patients with Crohn's disease-related PAF. In a multicenter retrospective study between 2005 and 2022 we included biologic-naive adults (>17 years) who initiated their first anti-TNF therapy for PAF after pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Pretreatment MRI studies were prospectively reread centrally by blinded radiologists. We developed and internally validated a prediction model based on clinical and radiologic parameters to predict the likelihood of anti-TNF treatment failure, clinically, at 6 months. We compared our model and a simplified version of MRI parameters alone with existing imaging-based PAF activity indices (MAGNIFI-CD and modified Van Assche MRI scores) by De Long statistical test. We included 221 patients: 32 ± 14 years, 60% males, 76% complex fistulas; 68% treated with infliximab and 32% treated with adalimumab. Treatment failure occurred in 102 (46%) patients. Our prediction model included age at PAF diagnosis, time to initiate anti-TNF treatment, and smoking and 8 MRI characteristics (supra/extrasphincteric anatomy, fistula length >4.3 cm, primary tracts >1, secondary tracts >1, external openings >1, tract hyperintensity on T1-weighted imaging, horseshoe anatomy, and collections >1.3 cm).

      "abstract": "\n \n \n Perianal fistulising Crohn’s disease (CD) is a disabling condition affecting up to 30% of patients. Studies suggest that greater fibrosis in the fistula tract is linked to improved clinical outcomes. This study aims to describe the natural history of perianal fistulising CD, including MRI parameters, and to identify clinical and radiological predictors of relapse and radiological healing\n \n \n \n Pelvic MRIs for perianal fistula performed at CHU Liège, Belgium, from 2018 to 2023 were collected. MRI protocols used 1.5T [Siemens Aera/Sola] or 3T [Siemens Vida] machines, with sequences including T2 TSE, T2 TSE FS, and T1 TSE FS before and after gadolinium injection. The MAGNIFI-CD and modified Van Assche (VA) indices were assessed for each patient. Two blinded radiologists evaluated fistula tract fibrosis. For patients with perianal flare, only the first MRI was analysed (MRI 1). For others, the first and last MRI (MRI 2) within the study period were assessed. Perianal flare was defined as abscess drainage or stoma creation for active perianal CD, and radiological healing as ≥80% fistula fibrosis or a MAGNIFI-CD score of 0.\n \n \n \n A total of 102 pelvic MRIs from 84 patients were included. The median patient age was 39 years (31–51), with 40% female. The median duration of perianal CD was 52 months (2–144); 26% had a seton at MRI 1, 7% had a stoma, and 41% were on anti-TNF therapy. During follow-up, 22% required abscess drainage. No clinical factors were associated with perianal flare. Univariate analysis identified several MRI 1 radiologic predictors of flare: fibrosis percentage (OR=0.72, p=0.033), VA hyperintensity T2 (OR=3.22, p=0.028), VA rectal involvement (OR=1.75, p=0.040), VA inflammatory mass (OR=1.42, p=0.022), VA T1 post-contrast hyperintensity (OR=3.68, p=0.045), MAGNIFI-CD score (OR=1.13, p=0.022), MAGNIFI T1 post-contrast hyperintensity (OR=1.77, p=0.031), and MAGNIFI inflammatory mass (OR=1.40, p=0.033). In multivariate analysis, only MAGNIFI T1 post-contrast hyperintensity remained significant (OR=1.77, p=0.031). Radiological healing was achieved in 30% at MRI 1 (25/84) and 44% at MRI 2 (8/18). No factors at MRI 1 predicted healing at MRI 2, though T1 post-contrast hyperintensity at MRI 1 showed a trend towards predicting lack of healing (OR=0.11, p=0.071).\n \n \n \n One-fifth of patients experienced perianal flare during follow-up. Clinical and therapeutic factors did not predict outcomes; only persistent MRI inflammation and low fistula fibrosis were linked to future abscess drainage. Specific MRI features may serve as therapeutic targets in perianal CD management, pending validation in a prospective cohort.\n",

The primary objective was to identify all available scoring indices and describe the operating properties of these indices.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFifty-three studies reported on the use of one clinical index (Perianal Disease Activity Index: PDAI), three PROMs and ten radiological indices. Twenty-five studies evaluated the operating properties of these indices. The PDAI demonstrated content validity, construct validity and responsiveness but criterion validity or reliability were not assessed. The Van Assche index (VAI), modified VAI and the Magnetic Resonance Index for Assessing Fistulas in Patients with CD (MAGNIFI-CD) were the most studied radiological indices. These indices demonstrated responsiveness and reliability. The VAI and MAGNIFI-CD demonstrated construct validity. Criterion and content validity and feasibility have not been assessed.

Statement appropriateness was rated by a panel (N = 15) of gastroenterologists, radiologists, and surgeons using modified RAND/University of California Los Angeles appropriateness methodology.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe modified Van Assche Index (mVAI) and the Magnetic Resonance Novel Index for Fistula Imaging in CD (MAGNIFI-CD) were considered appropriate instruments for use in pediatric perianal fistulizing disease clinical trials. Although there was concern regarding the use of intravascular contrast material in pediatric patients, its use in clinical trials was considered appropriate.

To assess the reliability of the Van Assche index, and to modify the instrument to improve reliability and create a novel index for fistulising CD. A consensus process developed scoring conventions for existing Van Assche index component items and new items. Four experienced radiologists evaluated 50 MRI images in random order on three occasions. Reliability was assessed by estimates of intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Common sources of disagreement were identified and recommendations made to minimise disagreement.

Sources of disagreement included number, location, and extension of fistula tracts, and rectal wall involvement. A modified Van Assche index (range 0-24) was created that included seven component items. Although \"almost perfect\" intra-rater reliability was observed for the assessment of MRI images for fistulising CD using the Van Assche index, inter-rater reliability was considerably lower.

      "abstract": "Fistulizing perianal disease is a frequent, chronic, and often debilitating manifestation of Crohn disease (CD) in adults and children, which in the past was relatively refractory to treatment. The advent of biologic agents such as anti-tumor necrosis factor-α and cellular therapies, used in conjunction with a range of surgical interventions, has greatly improved disease outcomes, although complete remission can still be elusive. This review considers current perianal imaging options, specifically pelvic MRI and endoanal and transperineal ultrasound, and their roles in diagnosis, management, and assessment of treatment response. Pelvic MRI is the first line technique for imaging of perianal CD given the complexity of fistulas encountered in CD. MRI technical acquisition parameters for adults and children and an approach to MRI interpretation and reporting are provided. Anatomic classification systems for fistulising perianal disease are presented. We also explore the history, current landscape, and future developments of MRI features of perianal disease as imaging biomarkers to quantify activity and severity, and consider CD MRI-based inflammatory activity scores. We discuss the reliability and validation of a number of indices (including PEMPAC, MAGNIFI-CD, mVAI, and Van Assche Index), their potential to quantify treatment response, and possible prognostic capabilities.",

      "abstract": "\n \n \n Despite considerable therapeutic advances over the last two decades in the management of Crohn’s disease(CD), complex anoperineal fistulas(APF) still constitute a real therapeutic challenge for the practitioner. Treatment is mainly medico-surgical, combining seton drainage and biotherapy. The ultimate goal is to obtain a deep remission, which combines clinical remission and a normal perineal MRI. Thus, several MRI scores have been proposed to assess the therapeutic response of APF to biotherapy.\n The aim of this study was to investigate the reliability of the new MRI scores: the modified Van Assche Index(mVAI) and the MAGNIFI-CD in the evaluation of the response of APF to anti-TNFα, by comparing them to the old version of the Van Assche Index(VAI).\n \n \n \n We conducted a retrospective study, including all patients followed up for CD with APF treated with anti-TNFα over a, 10-year period [2010–2020]. Clinical, biological, morphological and evolutionary data were collected. VAI, mVAI and MAGNIFI-CD scores were calculated from data provided by perineal MRI: number, locations, extensions and lengths of fistulous tracts, characteristics of collections. Clinical response to anti-TNFα was assessed by proctological examination, at the end of which the patients were classified into two groups:\n • Responders(26): having a complete remission (closure of all initially productive fistulous orifices) or partial response (closure of more than, 50% of orifices)\n • Non-responders(12): closure of less than, 50% of the initially productive fistulous orifices\n A statistical study was carried out to compare the performance of the different scores in assessing the response to treatment by calculating the area under the ROC curve with a, 95% confidence interval.\n \n \n \n A total of, 38 patients were included. The mean age was, 42 years [26–73] and the sex-ratio M/F was, 0,4. All patients had received anti-TNFα after disappearance of perineal collections if initially present (Infliximab in, 35 cases(92,1%) and Adalimumab in, 3 cases(7,9%)) combined with thiopurines in, 97,4%. The average duration of anti-TNFα therapy was, 46 months [5–180]\n The means of the different scores were calculated in responders and non-responders before and after anti-TNFα treatment respectively:\n \n A decrease in all three scores was observed after anti-TNFα treatment in the responders, in contrast to the non-responders, thus confirming therapeutic failure.\n Furthermore, the AUROC of the VAI, mVAI and MAGNIFI-CD scores in the assessment of response to anti-TNFα in APF were, 0,925, 0,908 and, 0,869 respectively.\n \n \n \n \n Our results suggest that the old version of the VAI, as well as the mVAI and MAGNIFI-CD, are reliable scores with comparable performance in the assessment of response to treatment in APF in CD.\n",

The site radiologist and 2 central radiologists provided a radiologist global assessment (RGA) on a 100 mm visual analog scale and scored the items selected by a Delphi group of 35 international radiologists and a review of the literature. Two weighted multivariable statistical models were constructed against the RGA.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEighty children underwent 95 pelvic magnetic resonance imaging scans; 64 were used for derivation and 31 for validation. The following items were included: fistula number, location, length and T2 hyperintensity; abscesses; rectal wall involvement; and fistula branching. The last 2 items had negative beta scores and thus were excluded in a contending basic model. In the validation cohort, the full and the basic models had the same strong correlation with the RGA (r = 0.75; P < 0.01) and with the adult Van Assche index (VAI; r = 0.93 and 0.92; P < 0.001).

Fistula volume and average T2 signal intensity showed moderate correlation to MAGNIFI-CD (r=0.72, p<0.001; r=0.49, p<0.001 respectively). LOPOCV AUC for normalised average T2 and fistula volume were 0.77 and 0.74, respectively, with sensitivities of 87% and 95%, and specificities of 62% and 52%. For MAGNIGI-CD, LOPOCV AUC was 0.84, with a sensitivity of 77% and specificity of 81%.\n \n \n \n pTRACK’s normalised T2 signal and fistula volume demonstrated comparable accuracy to MAGNIFI-CD, with higher sensitivity for predicting pCD activity and distinguishing active from non-active disease. These findings underscore pTRACK’s potential utility, warranting prospective validation in cohorts with more severe disease.\n \n",

      "abstract": "\n \n \n Perianal Crohn’s Disease (pCD) is a frequent and debilitating complication of Crohn’s Disease (CD). Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the imaging modality for diagnosis, classification, and treatment monitoring in pCD. To evaluate treatment response, a validated radiological index is mandatory. Recently, the MAGNIFI-CD index has been developed. The aim of our study was to validate the MAGNIFI-CD index; evaluating reliability, responsiveness and accuracy.\n \n \n \n At two tertiary IBD referral centers, patients (≥16yrs) with complex pCD that had pelvic MRI before and 3-24 months after medical and/or surgical treatment were included. Two independent, blinded abdominal radiologists randomly scored total MAGNIFI-CD and its separate items. Two clinicians scored clinical outcomes (remission, response, non-response) using the “fistula drainage assessment” (FDA). Interobserver agreement (ICCs or weighted K), responsiveness (according to FDA; Wilcoxon signed rank test), and test accuracy (ROC analyses for the follow-up (FU) MAGNIFI-CD) were determined. Youden indices (YI) were used to choose optimal cut-off values for the FDA categories.\n \n \n \n Sixty-seven patients (median age 30 [IQR 23-47], 51% female) were eligible with mean CD and pCD duration of 7.0 yrs (SD 8.7) and 3.7 yrs (SD 4.3), respectively. 44% was biological naïve, 9% had defunctioning ostomy and 20% had proctitis. Baseline MAGNIFI-CD was 18 [IQR 9–20]. MAGNIFI-CD had an almost perfect ICC of 0.88 (95%CI 0.78-0.92); reliability of the separate items was moderate to substantial. Between baseline and FU MAGNIFI-CD a significant decrease was observed in responders and remitters (p<0.05), while a non-significant decrease (p=0.14) was seen in clinical non-responders. AUROCFU MAGNIFI-CD was 0.80 (SD 0.05) discriminating remission and non-response/response, YImax of 0.61 resulted in a cut-off value ≤10 with a sensitivity and specificity of 70% and 80%. The AUROCFU MAGNIFI-CD was 0.75 (SD 0.07) discriminating response/remission and non-response, YImax of 0.50 resulted in a cut-off value ≤14 with a sensitivity and specificity of 73% and 75%.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n The MAGNIFI-CD index is a reliable radiological index supported by an almost perfect agreement. Given the moderate agreement, the item “dominant feature” would need additional training or better definitions. The index shows a robust responsiveness to clinical change and does not improve significantly in non-responders. The MAGNIFI-CD seems to be an acceptable to excellent test to accurately determine response or remission. We suggest a cut-off value of ≤14 for response and ≤10 for remission at follow-up MAGNIFI-CD. These results support that the MAGNIFI-CD is suitable for treatment monitoring in clinical trials.\n",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background and aims</h4>To improve management of patients with Crohn's disease, objective measurements of disease activity are needed. Ileocolonoscopy is the current reference standard but has limitations that restrict repeated use. Ultrasonography is potentially useful for activity monitoring, but no validated sonographic activity index is currently in widespread use. Thus, we aimed to construct and validate a simple ultrasound score for Crohn's disease.<h4>Methods</h4>Forty patients were prospectively examined with ultrasound and endoscopy in the development phase. The Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease [SES-CD] was used as a reference standard. Seven ultrasound variables [bowel wall thickness, length, colour Doppler, stenosis, fistula, stratification and fatty wrapping] were initially included, and multiple linear regression was used to select the variables that should be included in the final score. Second, the ultrasound data from each patient were re-examined for interobserver assessment using weighted kappa and intraclass correlation. Finally, the activity index was validated in a new cohort of 124 patients.<h4>Results</h4>Length, fistula and stenosis were excluded. The combination of the remaining variables provided a multiple correlation coefficient of r = 0.78. Interobserver analysis revealed poor agreement for stratification and fatty wrapping and these were thus excluded. There was excellent interobserver agreement for the remaining score consisting of wall thickness and colour Doppler. In both patient cohorts, the ultrasound score correlated well with SES-CD [Development cohort: rho = 0.83, p < 0.001, Validation cohort: rho = 0.78, p < 0.001]. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed an area under the curve of 0.92 and 0.88 for detecting endoscopic activity and moderate endoscopic activity, respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A simple ultrasound activity index for Crohn's disease consisting of bowel wall thickness and colour Doppler was constructed and validated and correlated well with endoscopic disease activity.ClinicalTrials. gov ID: NCT03481751.",

      "abstract": "IBDs are chronic destructive disorders that negatively affect the functional status of patients. Recently, the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Disability Index (IBD-DI) was developed according to standard WHO processes. The aims of the current study were to validate the IBD-DI in an independent patient cohort, to develop an index-specific scoring system and to describe the disability status of a well-defined population-based cohort of French patients with IBD. From February 2012 to March 2014, the IBD-DI questionnaire was administered to a random sample of adult patients with an established diagnosis of IBD issued from a French population-based registry. The IBD-DI consists of 28 items that evaluate the four domains of body functions, activity participation, body structures and environmental factors. Validation included item reduction and data structure, construct validity, internal consistency, interobserver and intraobserver reliability evaluations. 150 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and 50 patients with UC completed the IBD-DI validation phase. The intraclass correlation coefficient for interobserver reliability was 0.91 and 0.54 for intraobserver reliability. Cronbach's α of internal consistency was 0.86. IBD-DI scores varied from 0 to 100 with a mean of 35.3 (Q1=19.6; Q3=51.8). IBD-DI scores were highly correlated with Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (-0.82; p<0.001) and SF-36 (-0.61; p<0.05) scores. Female gender (p<0.001), clinical disease activity (p<0.0001) and disease duration (p=0.02) were associated with higher IBD-DI scores. The IBD-DI has been validated for use in clinical trials and epidemiological studies. The IBD-DI showed high internal consistency, interobserver reliability and construct validity, and a moderate intraobserver reliability. It comprises 14 questions and ranges from 0 to 100. The mean IBD-DI score was 35.3 and was associated with gender, clinical disease activity and disease duration. Further research is needed to confirm the structural validity and to assess the responsiveness of IBD-DI. 2011-A00877-34.",

      "abstract": "Background: Bone marrow lesions (BMLs) and synovitis on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are associated with symptoms and predict degeneration of articular cartilage in osteoarthritis (OA). Validated methods for their semiquantitative assessment on MRI are available, but they all have similar scoring designs and questionable sensitivity to change. New scoring methods with completely different designs need to be developed and compared to existing methods. Objectives: To compare the performance of new web-based versions of the Knee Inflammation MRI Scoring System (KIMRISS) with the MRI OA Knee Score (MOAKS) for quantification of BMLs and synovitis-effusion (S-E). Design: Retrospective follow-up cohort. Methods: We designed web-based overlays outlining regions in the knee that are scored for BML in MOAKS and KIMRISS. For KIMRISS, both BML and S-E are scored on consecutive sagittal slices. The performance of these methods was compared in an international reading exercise of 8 readers evaluating 60 pairs of scans conducted 1 year apart from cases recruited to the OA Initiative (OAI) cohort. Interobserver reliability for baseline status and baseline to 1 year change in BML and S-E was assessed by intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and smallest detectable change (SDC). Feasibility was assessed using the System Usability Scale (SUS). Results: Mean change in BML and S-E was minimal over 1 year. Pre-specified targets for acceptable reliability (ICC ⩾ 0.80 and ⩾ 0.70 for status and change scores, respectively) were achieved more frequently for KIMRISS for both BML and synovitis. Mean (95% CI) ICC for change in BML was 0.88 (0.83–0.92) and 0.69 (0.60–0.78) for KIMRISS and MOAKS, respectively. KIMRISS mean SUS usability score was 85.7 and at the 95th centile of ranking for usability versus a score of 55.4 and 20th centile for MOAKS. Conclusion: KIMRISS had superior performance metrics to MOAKS for quantification of BML and S-E. Both methods should be further compared in trials of new therapies for OA.",

      "abstract": "\n \n \n Perianal fistulising Crohn’s disease (pfCD) is a debilitating and complex complication of Crohn’s disease that is challenging to manage and associated with poor long-term outcomes. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy has emerged as a promising treatment option for medically refractory pfCD, but long-term data on efficacy and safety are limited. This study investigates the long-term outcomes of MSC therapy in patients with pfCD, focusing on clinical, radiological and patient-reported outcomes.\n \n \n \n All patients treated with a single dose of MSC therapy at two tertiary referral centres in the UK were included in a prospectively maintained cohort and patients were followed up for 5 years. The primary outcomes were clinical and radiological response, assessed using the fistula drainage assessment, TOpClass consensus definitions of radiological improvement and healed fistulae, MRI-based activity indices and expert radiologists’ VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) score of disease severity. Secondary outcomes include the Perianal Disease Activity Index (PDAI) and the Vaizey incontinence score.\n \n \n \n The analysis included 24 patients (14 female, 10 male) with a mean age of 37. The median follow-up was 60 months (clinical assessments) and 54 months (radiological evaluations). At 5 years, 25% patients (6/24) had evidence of persisting clinical response, and 54.2% (13/24) were in clinical remission. Radiologically, 75% (18/24) of patients showed improvement in the first 12 months post-treatment, with 37.5% (9/24) maintaining long-term radiological improvement at 5 years. Four patients (16.7%) achieved complete radiological healing at 5 years. The Van Assche Index score improved post treatment (p = 0.042) and long-term (p = 0.019), in concordance with a reduction in the radiologists’ VAS severity score post – treatment (p = 0.009) and at 5 years (p = 0.043). Significant reductions in PDAI were observed from baseline to 18 months (p< 0.001) and 5 years (p= 0.002). During the 5-year follow-up period, 58.3% (14 out of 24) of patients did not require additional surgery, and no adverse events or long-term continence impairment were observed (p = 0.582).\n \n \n \n This study demonstrates that MSC therapy for pCD results in significant long-term clinical and radiological improvements, with clinical remission in half of patients at 5 years and a safety profile consistent with prior studies. Despite the clinical remission, at 5 years only a minority experienced sustained radiological healing (16.7%) according to the new and stringent TOpClass definition. These findings support the use of MSC therapy as an effective treatment for pfCD, with durable benefits in symptom control and quality of life.\n \n \n \n 1.Anand, Easan, Devi, Jalpa, Joshi, Shivani, et al.

We collected patient-reported CAFQOL and IBDQ-32, as well as Fistula Drainage Assessment (FDA), Perianal Disease Activity Index (PDAI) and MRI (MAGNIFI-CD) outcomes at baseline, and at weeks 9, 26, and 52. QOL changes over time were analyzed using a linear mixed-effects model, and correlations between outcomes were assessed using Spearman correlation coefficients. Internal consistency was assessed with Cronbach’s alpha. The underlying structure of CAFQOL was evaluated with exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to identify distinct dimensions of quality of life. Responsiveness of CAFQOL and PDAI were reported in standardized response mean (SRM). Target CAFQOL values at week 52 for patients in complete remission by week 26 (PDAI≤4, MAGNIFI-CD=0) were calculated with a linear mixed-effects model. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) model was used to evaluate CAFQOL in relation to clinical remission (FDA).\n \n \n \n We included 62 patients with a mean CAFQOL of 59.8 (SD 16.4) at baseline (Table 1). CAFQOL showed significant improvement over time, with average improvements of 8 points (95% CI 4 – 11) at week 9, 12 points (95% CI 8 - 16) at week 26, and 22 points (95% CI 18 - 26) at week 52 (all p<0.0001) (Figure 1). CAFQOL was strongly correlated with IBDQ-32 (r = -0.78; p<0.001) supporting convergent validity, while correlations with FDA (r = 0.48; p<0.0001), PDAI (r = 0.33; p=0.131), and MAGNIFI-CD (r = 0.11; p=0.548) were weak to negligible, supporting discriminant validity. A Cronbach’s alpha of 0.80 supported internal consistency. EFA revealed three main factors: social-practical impacts, emotional-mental health impacts, and physical discomfort explaining 53% of the QOL variance. By week 52, SRM of CAFQOL and PDAI were -1.26 and -1.79 respectively, suggesting large effect sizes. CAFQOL ≤ 37 was associated with complete fistula remission (PDAI≤4, MAGNIFI-CD=0), and was able to detect clinical remission with 80% (95% CI: 58–92) sensitivity and 56% (95% CI 39–71) specificity (AUROC=0.735; p=0.0038).\n \n \n \n The CAFQOL is a reliable and consistently responsive tool that captures meaningful changes in quality of life over time regardless of the treatment modality.\n \n \n",

We aimed to develop and internally and externally validate a reliable and responsive endoscopic CD activity index.\n \n \n \n In this multi-part study, candidate endoscopic items for index development with face validity derived from a prior RAND/UCLA appropriateness exercise were assessed by blinded central readers using ileocolonoscopy videos from the phase 3b adalimumab EXTEND (NCT00348283) and phase 2 risankizumab (NCT02031276) trials. Acceptable item-level operating properties for further consideration as covariables in regression for model building included at least moderate inter-rater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]≥0.41), and medium responsiveness defined as the probability of a patient receiving active treatment having a better endoscopy score than a patient receiving placebo or win probability (WinP) ≥0.56.

Ninety-six patients with MRI-confirmed medial gastrocnemius injuries who underwent bilateral lower leg MRI between January 2018 and December 2023 were retrospectively analyzed. Injuries were graded using the Dai classification (Grades I–III). Axial T2-weighted SPAIR images were used to measure the medial gastrocnemius cross-sectional area (CSA) at the distal one-third between the knee joint and the musculotendinous junction. The Gastrocnemius Medial Head Ratio (GCM ratio) was calculated by dividing the CSA of the injured side by that of the uninjured side. Two experienced radiologists independently performed the measurements twice. Intra- and interobserver reliability were assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Cohen's kappa. A one-way ANOVA with the Bonferroni correction was used for group comparisons. ROC analysis evaluated the diagnostic performance of the GCM ratio. The GCM ratio significantly differed among Grade I (1.03 ± 0.02), Grade II (1.18 ± 0.06), and Grade III (1.35 ± 0.05) injuries (p < 0.001). Ipsilateral CSA increased with injury severity, whereas contralateral CSA remained consistent. CSA measurements showed excellent intra- and interobserver reliability (ICC > 0.87), and lesion grading demonstrated substantial to almost perfect agreement (κ = 0.75–0.88). ROC analysis revealed strong diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.986 for Grade I vs. II; AUC = 1.000 for Grade II vs. III). The GCM ratio provides a reproducible and objective MRI marker to aid in grading gastrocnemius strains, offering excellent diagnostic performance and clinical applicability.",

      "abstract": "Kidney allograft fibrosis is a marker of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and predicts functional decline, and eventual allograft failure. This study evaluates if spectral diffusion MRI can help detect early development and mild/moderate fibrosis in kidney allografts. In a prospective two-center study of kidney allografts, interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA) was scored and eGFR was calculated from serum creatinine. Multi-b-value DWI (bvalues=[0,10,30,50,80,120,200,400,800mm2/s]) was post-processed with spectral diffusion, intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Connection between imaging parameters and biological processes was measured by Mann-Whitney U-test and Spearman's rank; diagnostic ability was measured by five-fold cross-validation univariate and multi-variate logistic regression. Quality control analyses included volunteer MRI (n=4) and inter-observer analysis (n=19). 99 patients were included (50$\\pm$13yo, 64M/35F, 39 IFTA=0, 22 IFTA=2, 20 IFTA=4, 18 IFTA=6, 46 eGFR<=45mL/min/1.73m2, mean eGFR=47.5$\\pm$21.3mL/min/1.73m2). Spectral diffusion detected fibrosis (IFTA>0) in patients with normal/stable eGFR>45ml/min/1.73m2 [AUC(95$\\%$CI)=0.72(0.56,0.87),p=0.007]. Spectral diffusion detected mild/moderate fibrosis (IFTA=2-4) [AUC(95$\\%$CI)=0.65(0.52,0.71),p=0.023], as did ADC [AUC(95$\\%$CI)=0.71(0.54,0.87),p=0.013)]. eGFR, time-from-transplant, and allograft size could not. Interobserver correlation was >0.50 in 24 out of 40 diffusion parameters. Spectral diffusion MRI showed detection of mild/moderate fibrosis and fibrosis before decline in function. It is a promising method to detect early development of fibrosis and CKD before progression.",

      "abstract": "Semi-quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scoring is more challenging in some anatomic regions than others. Bone marrow lesion (BML) is an important scoring feature and may be more closely related to clinical outcomes in arthritis in some anatomic regions than others. The Knee Inflammation MRI Scoring System (KIMRISS) scores BML and synovitis-effusion from fluid-sensitive sagittal MRI[1]. Via web-based interface, readers place ready-made overlays onto scorable portions of each bone, divided into grid squares which are scored dichotomously (yes/no) for presence of BML. The total KIMRISS BML score, which sums positive grid squares on all slices, has been previously shown to have high inter-rater reliability for both status and change.We aimed to evaluate patterns of regional variation in inter-rater reliability for BML across the knee via KIMRISS grid elements. This granular analysis serves as a foundation for further study of the relationship of precise BML location to clinical outcomes.Baseline MRI from 61 patients in the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) dataset were scored by 8 trained readers using KIMRISS scoring. Total scores for each of the 28 grid overlay regions (14 femur, 10 tibia, 4 patella) were calculated by adding up positive scores from all scorable MRI slices. We calculated descriptive statistics and interclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for all 28 reader pairs, then combined any neighbouring grid locations with ICC <0.5 before recalculating the ICC.The 8-reader mean (SD) BML scores at each scoring location (Table 1) showed that the mean reader pair ICC was very good (>=0.80) or good (0.70-0.80) for 17/28 (61%) of the grid regions (Figure 1). The lowest ICCs occurred at the inferior patella [P4; mean (SD) ICC=0.52 (0.19)], a small interior region of the femur [mean (SD) ICC=0.49 (0.26)], and the two most posterior regions of the tibia [mean (SD) ICC=0.41 (0.26) and 0.31 (0.33)]. Lower reliability was also found in regions of tibia not immediately adjacent to the tibiofemoral joint (ICC range: 0.60-0.67) as well as posterior non-articular regions of the femur (ICC range: 0.59-0.65). Combining the posterior tibial regions scores (T5+T55) slightly improved ICC compared to separate scores [mean (SD) ICC= 0.40 (0.29)].Most individual KIMRISS grid squares were scored with high reliability. Decreased reliability in certain regions may be due to lower incidence of BML or anatomical features that lead to difficulty of interpretation at specific locations. Combining neighbouring regions with lower reliability, such as those at the posterior tibia, may increase reliability if discrepancy arises from assigning a positive score for the same lesion to different grid squares between readers. The patterns of reliability demonstrated here support further study of the impact of precise BML location status scores on clinical outcomes.[1]Jaremko JL, Jeffery D, Buller M, et alPreliminary validation of the Knee Inflammation MRI Scoring System (KIMRISS) for grading bone marrow lesions in osteoarthritis of the knee: data from the Osteoarthritis InitiativeRMD Open2017;3:e000355. doi: 10.1136/rmdopen-2016-000355Figure 1.KIMRISS grid region labels with 8-reader mean ICC from baseline knee MRIs from the Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset (n=61).Table 1.8-reader mean (SD) BML score at each KIMRISS grid region (colour coded according to ICC in Fig 1.)PatellaFemurTibiaRegionMean (SD)RegionMean (SD)RegionMean (SD)P12.0 (2.5)TrochlearFT11.8 (2.7)Subchondral RegionT11.6 (2.8)P22.5 (2.6)FT20.6 (2.0)T21.8 (3.0)P31.9 (2.3)FT32.6 (3.0)T31.9 (3.1)P40.6 (1.1)FT40.8 (2.1)T41.4 (2.5)Weight-bearingFC11.3 (2.2)T50.5 (1.0)FC20.6 (1.9)Below Subchondral RegionT110.6 (1.7)FC30.8 (2.0)T220.8 (1.9)FC40.3 (1.4)T330.8 (1.8)FC50.5 (1.6)T440.6 (1.5)FC60.2 (0.8)T550.2 (0.6)PosteriorFP10.4 (0.9)FP20.2 (0.7)FP30.2 (0.6)FP40.1 (0.5)NIL.Stephanie Wichuk: None declared, Paul Bird Consultant of: AbbVie, Bristol Myers Squibb, Celgene, Janssen, MSD, Novartis, Pfizer, Roche, UCB, Iris Eshed: None declared, Robert G Lambert Consultant of: Calyx, CARE Arthritis, Image Analysis Group (IAG), Walter P Maksymowych Consultant of: AbbVie, Bristol Myers Squibb, Boehringer, Celgene, Eli Lilly, Galapagos, Janssen, Novartis, Pfizer, and UCB, Grant/research support from: AbbVie, Novartis, Pfizer, and UCB, Andrew McReynolds: None declared, Susanne Juhl Pedersen Speakers bureau: MSD, Pfizer, AbbVie, UCB, Novartis, Consultant of: AbbVie, UCB, Novartis, Grant/research support from: AbbVie, MSD, and Novartis, Ulrich Weber: None declared, Joel Paschke: None declared, Jacob L Jaremko: None declared.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Intestinal ultrasound (IUS) is a non-invasive tool for monitoring Crohn’s disease (CD) activity. Recently, sonographic activity scores, including the International Bowel Ultrasound Segmental Activity Score (IBUS-SAS) and Simple Ultrasound Activity Score for CD (SUS-CD), were developed. This study aimed to assess their clinical application value. Methods This retrospective study enrolled patients with CD from March 2021 to June 2022. The diagnostic performance of the ultrasound scores was evaluated using the simplified endoscopic score for CD (SES-CD). Correlations of ultrasound scores with SES-CD, CD activity index (CDAI), and inflammatory biomarkers were assessed. Inter-rater reliability was compared. Results In total, 140 patients were included. The IBUS-SAS for evaluating disease activity had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.895, sensitivity of 85.4%, and specificity of 82.4% for the cut-off value of 48.7. The SUS-CD revealed an AUC of 0.835, sensitivity of 92.7%, and specificity of 64.7% for the cut-off value of 2.5. The IBUS-SAS and SUS-CD were positively correlated with SES-CD (r = 0.511 and 0.534, respectively). The scores correlated significantly with the CDAI and inflammatory biomarkers (all p < 0.01). The IBUS-SAS was more strongly correlated with CDAI (r = 0.666 vs 0.486) and C-reactive protein (r = 0.645 vs 0.434) than the SUS-CD. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of the IBUS-SAS and SUS-CD between the two sonologists was excellent (ICC = 0.96 and 0.78, respectively). Conclusion Both the IBUS-SAS and SUS-CD can evaluate disease activity in CD and exhibited a significant correlation with activity indices and inflammatory biomarkers.

      "abstract": "Objective To show that for the MRI workup of non-specific low back pain and/or lumbar radiculopathy, the acquisition of T1-weighted sequences in the sagittal plane could be waived when using an FSE T2-weighted Dixon sequence. Materials and methods Three musculoskeletal radiologists retrospectively reviewed fifty lumbar spine MRI examinations performed for non-specific low back pain and/or lumbar radiculopathy. Two protocols were separately analyzed in the sagittal plane: a standard protocol (T1-weighted, in-phase, and water-only images of an FSE T2-weighted Dixon sequence) and a simplified protocol (fat-only, in-phase, and water-only images of an FSE T2-weighted Dixon sequence). Eight items usually assessed on T1-weighted sequences were analyzed for each of the vertebrae ( n  = 250), vertebral endplates ( n  = 500), vertebral corners ( n  = 1000), foramina ( n  = 500), lamina ( n  = 500), and facet joints ( n  = 500). Interchangeability of these protocols was tested using the individual equivalence index. A decrease in interobserver agreement of ≥ 5% when one reader used the simplified protocol compared with when both readers used the standard protocol was considered clinically significant. Interreader and intrareader agreement were assessed using kappa statistics. Rates of findings with each protocol were compared using odd ratios. Results The standard and simplified protocols were interchangeable (range of upper bound of the 95%CI of individual equivalence index = 0.25 to 1.38%). Intraprotocol and interprotocol interreader kappa values were similar (0.253–0.671 vs. 0.236–0.723, respectively). Rates of findings were not statistically significantly different ( p  ≥ 0.074), or were higher with the simplified protocol ( p  ≤ 0.036). Conclusion In our target population, a single sagittal T2-weighted Dixon sequence may replace the recommended combination of T1-, T2-, and fat-suppressed T2-weighted sequences. Key Points • In patients with non-specific low back pain or lumbar radiculopathy, spine MRI in the sagittal plane could be limited to a single FSE T2-weighted Dixon sequence, hereby reducing the acquisition time. • A simplified protocol of spine MRI in the sagittal plane combining FSE T2-weighted Dixon sequence provides the same information as a standard protocol including T1-, T2-, and fat-suppressed T2-weighted sequences for the workup of degenerative lumbar spine lesions. • For some findings shown on the simplified protocol, such as focal bone marrow replacement lesions or signs of infection, additional sequences including pre- and post-contrast T1-weighted sequences may be required, as is currently the case when using the standard protocol.",

Subjects with known or suspected CD were prospectively recruited between December 2011 and August 2014. Each patient underwent MRI and ileocolonoscopy with terminal ileum biopsies. Four MRI scoring systems (Magnetic Resonance Index of Activity [MaRIA], Clermont score, London score, and Crohn disease MRI Index) and component features were applied by two observers and correlated to the Crohn disease endoscopic index of severity (CDEIS, 0-44) and histopathologic endoscopic acute inflammation score (0-6). Interobserver agreement (weighted kappa and intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]) and diagnostic accuracy for active and ulcerating endoscopic or histopathologic disease were evaluated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNinety-eight patients (median age, 32 years old; 55 women, 43 men) were included. All four scoring systems showed good interobserver agreement (ICC = 0.70-0.78), moderate-to-strong correlation to CDEIS (r = 0.57-0.67) and weak-to-moderate correlation to endoscopic acute inflammation score (r = 0.38-0.49). Scoring systems' diagnostic accuracy for active and ulcerating endoscopic disease ranged from 73% to 78% and 71% to 76%, respectively, whereas for active histopathologic disease accuracy ranged from 65% to 72%. Between the scoring systems, no significant differences were found for both observers regarding interobserver agreement, correlation coefficients, and diagnostic accuracy.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAll scoring systems were comparable in terms of interobserver agreement, correlation to the endoscopic and histopathologic reference standard, and diagnostic accuracy. The London score, MaRIA, and Clermont score have the additional benefit of having validated cutoff values for both active and ulcerating endoscopic disease.",

This study investigates whether segmentation software could provide precise and reproducible objective measurements of fistula volume. Methods: Retrospective analysis of patients with perianal Crohn’s fistula at our institution between 2007 and 2013. Pre- and post-biologic MRI scans were used with varying time intervals. A total of two radiologists recorded fistula volumes, mean signal intensity and time taken to measure fistula volumes using validated Open Source segmentation software. A total of three radiologists assessed fistula response to treatment (improved, worse or unchanged) by comparing MRI scans. Results: A total of 18 cases were reviewed for this pilot study. Inter-observer variability was very good for volume and mean signal intensity; intra-class correlation (ICC) 0.95 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91–0.98] and 0.95 (95% CI 0.90–0.97) respectively. Intra-observer variability was very good for volume and mean signal intensity; ICC 0.99 (95% CI 0.97–0.99) and 0.98 (95% CI 0.95–0.99) respectively. Average time taken to measure fistula volume was 202 s and 250 s for readers 1 and 2. Agreement between three specialist radiologists was good [kappa 0.69 (95% CI 0.49–0.90)] for the subjective assessment of fistula response. Significant association was found between objective percentage volume change and subjective consensus agreement of response (p = 0.001). Median volume change for improved, stable or worsening fistula response was −67% [interquartile range (IQR): −78, −47], 0% (IQR: −16, +17), and +487% (IQR: +217, +559) respectively.

Currently, data on postoperative MRI findings are scarce, although they are considered important for assessing healing and recurrence. Our aim, therefore, was to evaluate fistula characteristics on MRI and their relationship with clinical outcomes after LIFT.<h4>Method</h4>Consecutive Crohn's patients treated with LIFT between 2007 and 2018 who underwent baseline and follow-up MRI were retrospectively included. MRIs were scored by two radiologists according to characteristics based on the original and modified Van Assche indices. MRI findings, with emphasis on fibrosis, and the relationship with clinical healing, re-interventions and recurrences are described.<h4>Results</h4>Twelve patients were included [four men, median age 34 (interquartile range 28-39) years]. Follow-up MRI was performed at a median of 5.5 months (interquartile range 2.5-6.0) after LIFT. At baseline, all patients showed a tract with predominantly granulation tissue, which changed to predominantly fibrotic in seven (in three of whom it was completely fibrotic). All patients with a (predominantly) fibrotic tract had clinical closure and no re-interventions or recurrences during long-term follow-up. In contrast, of the five patients with persisting granulation tissue, two reached clinical healing, two needed re-intervention and one had a recurrence.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Markedly decreased fistula activity can be observed on MRI after LIFT. The majority of patients develop a predominantly fibrotic tract relatively soon after LIFT without clinical recurrence, suggesting a highly effective therapy. Unfavourable clinical outcomes were only present in patients with persisting granulation tissue, indicating the potential prognostic value of MRI.",

Purpose To assess the reliability of MR enterography features to describe Crohn disease strictures and determine correlation with stricture severity. Materials and Methods A retrospective study of patients with symptomatic terminal ileal Crohn disease strictures who underwent MR enterography at tertiary care centers (Cleveland Clinic: September 2013 to November 2020; Mayo Clinic: February 2008 to March 2019) was conducted by using convenience sampling. In the development phase, blinded and trained radiologists independently evaluated 26 MR enterography features from baseline and follow-up examinations performed more than 6 months apart, with no bowel resection performed between examinations. Follow-up examinations closest to 12 months after baseline were selected. Reliability was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). In the validation phase, after five features were redefined, reliability was re-estimated in an independent convenience sample using baseline examinations. Multivariable linear regression analysis identified features with at least moderate interrater reliability (ICC ≥0.41) that were independently associated with stricture severity. Results Ninety-nine (mean age, 40 years ± 14 [SD]; 50 male) patients were included in the development group and 51 (mean age, 45 years ± 16 [SD]; 35 female) patients were included in the validation group. In the development group, nine features had at least moderate interrater reliability. One additional feature demonstrated moderate reliability in the validation group. Stricture length (ICC = 0.85 [95% CI: 0.75, 0.91] and 0.91 [95% CI: 0.75, 0.96] in development and validation phase, respectively) and maximal associated small bowel dilation (ICC = 0.74 [95% CI: 0.63, 0.80] and 0.73 [95% CI: 0.58, 0.87] in development and validation group, respectively) had the highest interrater reliability. Stricture length, maximal stricture wall thickness, and maximal associated small bowel dilation were independently (regression coefficients, 0.09-3.97; P < .001) associated with stricture severity. Conclusion MR enterography definitions and scoring conventions for reliably assessing features of Crohn disease strictures were developed and validated, and feature correlation with stricture severity was determined. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

Purpose To assess the reliability of CT enterography features to describe Crohn disease strictures and their correlation with stricture severity. Materials and Methods A retrospective study was conducted in 43 adult patients with symptomatic terminal ileal Crohn disease strictures who underwent standard-of-care CT enterography at a tertiary care center at the Cleveland Clinic between January 2008 and August 2016. After training on standardized definitions, four abdominal radiologists blinded to all patient information assessed imaging features (seven continuous measurements and nine observations) of the most distal ileal stricture in two separate sessions (separated by ≥2 weeks) in random order. Features with an interrater intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.41 or greater (ie, moderate reliability or better) were considered reliable. Univariable and multivariable linear regression analysis identified reliable features associated with a visual analog scale of overall stricture severity. Significant reliable features were assessed as components of a CT enterography-based model to quantitate stricture severity. Results Examinations in 43 patients (mean age, 52 years ± 16 [SD]; 23 female) were evaluated. Five continuous measurements and six observations demonstrated at least moderate interrater reliability (interrater ICC range, 0.42 [95% CI: 0.25, 0.57] to 0.80 [95% CI: 0.67, 0.88]). Of these, 10 were univariably associated with stricture severity, and three continuous measurements-stricture length (interrater ICC, 0.64 [95% CI: 0.42, 0.81]), maximal associated small bowel dilation (interrater ICC, 0.80 [95% CI: 0.67, 0.88]), and maximal stricture wall thickness (interrater ICC, 0.50 [95% CI: 0.34, 0.62])-were independently associated (P value range, <.001 to .003) with stricture severity in a multivariable model. These three measurements were used to derive a well-calibrated (optimism-adjusted calibration slope = 1.00) quantitative model of stricture severity. Conclusion Standardized CT enterography measurements and observations can reliably describe terminal ileal Crohn disease strictures. Stricture length, maximal associated small bowel dilation, and maximal stricture wall thickness are correlated with stricture severity. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

Capsule study was viewed and the different indices were independently scored by two trained paediatric gastroenterologists. The relationship between pre-existing scores and CE-CD was assessed by linear regression analysis. Clinical outcomes prediction assessment was based on receiver operating characteristics curves, survival analysis and Cox regression. Finally, interobserver agreement was measured.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFifty-nine patients were finally included. CE-CD showed a strong positive correlation with the Lewis score (ρ = 0.947) and the Capsule Endoscopy Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CECDAI) (ρ = 0.982). Both CE-CD and CECDAI were significant predictors of treatment escalation (hazard ratio 1.07 and 1.09, respectively, with both p-values < 0.01). However, no score predicted risk of hospital admission, surgery or clinical/endoscopic relapse. The presence of moderate-to-severe small bowel (SB) inflammation, defined as a score of ≥9 on CE-CD, provided a hazard ratio of treatment escalation of 2.6 (95% confidence interval: 1.3-5.3). This cut-off provided the optimal sensitivity/specificity pair: 48.4%/89.3%. No interobserver misclassification among inflammation categories given by CE-CD were observed (kappa 100%).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCE-CD is a useful tool to document SB inflammation in children with CD. It correlates strongly with classical scores, can better predict need for treatment escalation and shows good interobserver agreement.",

Although MRI is widely used for ankle assessment, no validated system exists for classifying normal morphological variation of the peroneus brevis tendon. This study aimed to validate an MRI-based classification system. We analyzed 130 normal peroneus brevis tendons (power > 0.8, α = 0.05, effect size = 0.31) on consecutive 3T ankle MRI scans. Persons with fractures, ligament injuries, or peroneal tendon pathology were excluded. Each tendon was evaluated on a single standardized axial PD-weighted slice, selected just proximal to the lateral malleolus apex. Seven independent raters classified tendons into four types: general flat, flat with lateral bulge, flat with medial bulge, and oval. Inter-rater reliability was assessed using Cohen’s kappa, Gwet’s AC1, and Fleiss’ kappa. Classification robustness was evaluated using F1 scores, ROC analysis, and precision-recall metrics. The most common forms were general flat (37.7%) and oval (22.3%). Fleiss’ kappa was 0.691 (95% CI 0.629–0.752), with strong pairwise agreement (Cohen’s kappa and Gwet’s AC1: 0.58–0.87). ROC AUC was 0.89; majority voting improved agreement (F1 = 0.93).

Methods 81 knees were evaluated in 69 patients aged 30.0±12.6 years (mean±SD). Consecutive arthroscopy-proven meniscal tears were evaluated by two board-certified radiologists on MRI and two sports surgeons on arthroscopies. The surgically validated ISAKOS classification of meniscal tears was used to describe medial meniscus (MM) and lateral meniscus (LM) tears on MRI and re-evaluation of images from completed arthroscopies. Prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK), t-tests and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were calculated. Results For LM on 1.5 T, the agreements for location, depth, tear length and pattern were good to excellent in all categories except fair for tissue quality (PABAK=0.35–0.41) and zone 2 (PABAK=0.35) identification. For MM, the agreements were good to excellent in all except moderate for tissue quality (PABAK=0.6) and zone 1 and 3 (PABAK=0.40–0.47), and fair for zone 2 identification (PABAK=0.27). Similar results were seen on 3 T with improved LM zonal identification (PABAK=0.52–0.90) and better correlation of tear lengths, which were different on 1.5 T vs 3.0 T (p=0.01–0.03). For 1.5 T cases, both MM and LM tear lengths were larger on MRI versus arthroscopy (MM, p=0.004; LM, p=0.095). For 3 T, the MM tear lengths were larger on MRI versus arthroscopy (p=0.001). Conclusion ISAKOS classification of meniscal tears on both 1.5 and 3.0 T MRI provides satisfactory inter-rater and intermethod reliability for use in clinical practice. Level of evidence: IV.",

      "abstract": "Purpose We aimed to identify the anterolateral ligament (ALL) tears in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)-deficient knees using standard 1.5-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods We included all patients who underwent primary ACL reconstruction at our center between 2012 and 2015. Exclusion criteria included patients with multiple ligament injuries, lateral collateral ligament, posterolateral corner, and infections, and patients who underwent MRI more than 2 months after their injury. All patients ( n  = 148) had ACL tears that were subsequently arthroscopically reconstructed. The magnetic resonance (MR) images of the injured knees performed within 2 months of injury were reviewed by a musculoskeletal radiologist and an orthopedic surgeon. The patients were divided into two groups. The first group of patients had MRI performed within 1 month of injury. The second group of patients had MRI performed 1–2 months after the index injury. Both assessors were blinded and the MR mages were read separately to assess the presence of ALL, presence of a tear and the location of the tear. Based on their readings, interobserver agreement (kappa statistic (K)), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy were compared. Results The ALL was identified in 100% of the patients. However, there was a discrepancy of up to 15% in the identification of tear of the ALL. In the first group in which MRI scans were performed within 1 month of injury, the ALL tear was identified by the radiologist in 92% of patients and by the surgeon in 90% of patients (Κ = 0.86). In the second group in which MRI scans were performed within 1–2 months of the injury, the ALL tear was identified by the radiologist in 78% of patients and by the surgeon in 93% of patients (K = 0.62). Conclusion The ALL can be accurately identified on MRI, but the presence and location of ALL tear and its location cannot be reliably identified on MRI. The accuracy in identification and characterization of a tear was affected by the interval between the time of injury and the time when the MRI was performed.

In recent years, several imaging biomarkers have been suggested to predict cerebellar mutism syndrome based on its probable pathoanatomical causes. This study investigates the reliability of preoperative imaging biomarkers for cerebellar mutism syndrome in paediatric posterior fossa tumours. Specifically, it examines the interobserver agreement on the size, invasion, and compression of selected regions of interest with structured magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reporting. Preoperative brain MRI scans from ten paediatric patients with posterior fossa tumours, conducted at a single institution, were analysed. The scans were evaluated by three neuroradiologists from three different institutions across two countries using a structured reporting format. The interobserver agreement was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient and Fleiss’ kappa. All estimates were reported with a 95% confidence interval. The study found good to excellent agreement in measuring tumour size, tumour volume, and the Evans index. Substantial agreement was found in tumour pathology and location. However, the interobserver agreement was unreliable for invasion and compression of the included anatomical structures. Findings from this study challenge the reliability of preoperative imaging biomarkers for cerebellar mutism syndrome, emphasising the need for further investigation into consistent and reproducible biomarkers relevant to this syndrome.",

      "abstract": "\n \n \n Perianal fistulizing Crohn’s disease (pfCD) poses a significant challenge, requiring precise endpoints in clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness of therapies. While Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for assessing fistula healing, variability in radiological definitions complicates clinical trial design and real-world treatment evaluations. This study aimed to achieve international consensus on the definition of radiological healing in pfCD.\n \n \n \n This two-phase study was conducted by the Treatment Optimisation and CLASSification of perianal Crohn’s Disease (TOpCLASS) consortium.\n Phase 1 involved a systematic review to identify MRI-based variables and indices used to define radiological healing in pfCD, with the protocol registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024504334). The methodological quality of these indices was assessed using the COnsensus-based standards for the selection of Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) framework. A comprehensive list of variables was generated for the subsequent questionnaire.\n In Phase 2, an online modified Delphi consensus process was used, involving international pfCD experts. Two rounds of surveys were conducted, followed by a final stakeholder meeting to achieve consensus. An agreement threshold of >80% was set for consensus items, with results reported according to Accurate Consensus Reporting Document (ACCORD) guidelines.\n \n \n \n Eighty-four experts from 16 countries participated in the Delphi process. A strong consensus (>95%) was reached on defining a radiologically healed fistula as the absence of T2-weighted hyperintensity, a completely fibrotic fistula tract and, when contrast is used, the absence of contrast enhancement on post-contrast T1-weighted images (Table 1).\n Radiological improvement was defined (80% consensus) as an unequivocal reduction in one or more of the following: T2-weighted hyperintensity, fistula diameter, length, abscess size, or a predominantly fibrous fistula tract. A reduction in hyperintensity on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images also indicated improvement (Table 1).\n Other findings on MRI timing, surgical interventions, advanced therapies, MRI sequences, and central reading recommendations are shown in Figure 2.\n \n \n \n This international consensus represents a major step toward standardizing radiological endpoints in pfCD. Adoption of this definition will improve the consistency and reliability of pfCD assessments in clinical care and research. Future studies are underway to validate the definition and examine how changes in MRI variables predict long-term outcomes and quality of life improvements.\n \n \n \n 1.Caron B, D’Amico F, Danese S, Peyrin-Biroulet L.

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate pre- and postoperative fistula characteristics on MRI and the relation with clinical outcomes after LIFT procedure.\n \n \n \n Consecutive Crohn’s patients treated with LIFT between 2007 and 2018 for high perianal fistulas who underwent a baseline and follow-up (FU) MRI were included in this retrospective study. MRI’s were scored by two radiologists according to a composed score based on the original and modified Van Assche scores with the addition of several items (Table 1). Findings at MRI and the relation to clinical healing were described.\n \n \n \n A total of 12 patients were included (4 male, median age 34 years (IQR 28–39)). The FU MRI was performed a median 5.5 months (IQR 2.5–6.0) after the LIFT procedure. At this time eight patients (67%) reached clinical healing, which increased to ten patients (83%) during follow-up. None had a recurrence. Three patients (25%) needed a re-intervention after the FU MRI due to inflammatory masses and/or persisting fistula tracts. At baseline, all patients showed a tract predominantly filled with granulation tissue, which changed to predominantly fibrotic in seven patients (58%) (Figure 1). All clinically responding patients showed a decrease in tract volume and/or hyperintensity (i.e. activity) with an absence of hyperintensity on T1 and T2 in four (33%) patients.\n \n \n \n \n Clearly decreased fistula activity can be observed on MRI after LIFT surgery in Crohn’s patients. A large proportion of patients develops a fibrotic tract relatively soon after the procedure and shows no clinical recurrences, suggesting a highly effective therapy and prognostic value of MRI.\n",

Local injection of hAEC was safe, well tolerated and the injection procedure was feasible. Complete response occurred in 4 patients, and a partial response in an additional 4 patients. There was a mean reduction in the Perianal Disease Activity Index of 6.5 points (95% CI -9.0 to -4.0, p = 0.0002, paired t-test), modified Van Assche MRI Index of 2.3 points (95% CI -3.9 to -0.6, p = 0.012, paired t-test) and a mean improvement of 15.8 points (95% CI 4.9 to 26.8, p = 0.010, paired t-test) in quality of life using the Short IBD-Questionnaire in complete responders. Local injection of hAEC therapy for refractory complex perianal fistulising Crohn's disease appears safe, well-tolerated, feasible and demonstrated improvement. Quality of life is improved in those who achieve complete fistula healing.

It is hypothesised that higher drug levels will lead to improved healing on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); but this is yet to be established. This study evaluated the association between anti-TNF drug levels and radiological outcomes in pfCD.\n \n \n \n A multi-centre retrospective study (FISCAL), across 10 ANZ Inflammatory Bowel Disease Consortium sites. Patients with pfCD on stable maintenance dosing of infliximab or adalimumab, with drug levels within 6-months of a pelvic MRI from 2010 to 2020 were included. Patients receiving perianal fistula surgery between drug level and MRI were excluded. MRI disease activity was scored using the Van Assche Index (VAI), with an inflammatory sub-score (VAIinfl) derived from the VAI indices: hyperintensity on T2-weighted images, collections >3mm diameter, and rectal wall involvement. Primary endpoint was radiological healing (VAIinfl≤6). Secondary endpoint was radiological remission (VAIinfl=0). Drug level tertiles were correlated to changes in VAIinfl scores. ROC analyses were used to identify optimal target drug levels.\n \n \n \n Of 193 patients (infliximab, n=117; adalimumab, n=76), radiological healing was achieved in 47.0 and 44.7% and radiological remission in 17.1 and 15.8% of patients receiving infliximab and adalimumab, respectively. Patients with radiological healing had higher median drug levels compared to those with radiologically active disease (infliximab 6.0 vs 3.9µg/mL, P=0.03; adalimumab 9.1 vs 6.2µg/mL, P=0.02). Patients with radiological remission had higher median drug levels compared to those with radiologically active disease (infliximab 7.4 vs 3.9µg/mL, P<0.01; adalimumab 9.8 vs 6.2µg/mL, P=0.07). There was a significant incremental reduction in median VAIinfl with higher anti-TNF drug level tertiles, shown in Figure 1. By ROC analyses, the optimal trough infliximab levels for radiological healing and remission were 4.0µg/mL (sensitivity 69.1%, specificity 45.2%, AUC 0.62, P=0.03) and 6.5µg/mL (sensitivity 60.0%, specificity 72.2%, AUC 0.67, P=0.02), respectively. The optimal adalimumab levels for radiological healing and remission were 7.2µg/mL (sensitivity 67.6%, specificity 59.5%, AUC 0.65, P=0.03) and 9.7µg/mL (sensitivity 58.0%, specificity 70.0%, AUC 0.62, P=0.20), respectively.\n \n \n \n \n In the largest study of its kind, higher anti-TNF drug levels were associated with improved MRI parameters as per the VAI in patients with pfCD; with an incremental improvement in MRI outcomes at higher anti-TNF drug level tertiles for both infliximab and adalimumab.

We assessed the reliability and responsiveness of histologic indices/items, developed an exploratory index, and compared different methods of scoring.\n \n \n \n Using baseline and week 12 histologic image sets from the EXTEND placebo-controlled trial, blinded central readers scored 4 histologic indices (the Global Histologic Activity Score [GHAS], Geboes Score [GS], Robarts Histopathology Index [RHI], and Nancy Index [NHI]) and 3 additional novel items identified by an expert panel (mucin depletion, basal plasmacytosis, and pyloric gland metaplasia in the ileum). Reliability and responsiveness were evaluated for a global score (4 colonic segments + ileum), colonic score (4 colonic segments) and ileal score (ileum only) using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and area under the receiver operating curve (AUC), respectively. Change was defined using treatment assignment and improvement in histologic disease activity as measured on a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS) in responsiveness testing. Exploratory indices were developed using backward stepwise linear regression analysis. Candidate independent variables were items with an ICC ≥0.4 and AUC ≥0.56.

Inter-rater reliability was substantial to almost perfect (ICC=0.73-0.85) and responsiveness was small to large (treatment assignment AUC=0.50-0.65; VAS AUC=0.71-0.94). The GHAS, GS, RHI, and NHI reached the minimum threshold for reliability (ICC ≥0.4) and responsiveness (AUC ≥0.56) regardless of whether the global and colonic scores were calculated using the worst affected segment, average of the included segments, or sum of the included segments (Table 1-3). Five items were tested as candidate predictors. Three exploratory indices were developed, each consisting of 3 items: a global index (neutrophils in the lamina propria, neutrophils in the epithelium, and erosion/ulceration), colonic index (chronic inflammatory infiltrate, neutrophils in the lamina propria, and erosion/ulceration) and ileal index (chronic inflammatory infiltrate, neutrophils in the epithelium, and erosion/ulceration).

This diagnostic study was not registered on a clinical trial platform. We grade the T2 signal ratio and T1 enhancement ratio with a score of 0 to 3. The ratios were calculated as follow: terminal ileal inflammation of intestinal T2 signal intensity/adjacent normal intestinal T2 signal intensity (T2 ratio 1), terminal ileal inflammation intestinal T2 signal intensity/vertical muscle T2 signal intensity (T2 ratio 2), the fifth phase of the inflamed intestinal T1 signal intensity/noncontrast intestine T1 signal (T1 ratio 3), and the fifth phase of inflamed intestinal T1 signal intensity/adjacent normal intestinal T1 signal (T1 ratio 4).

      "abstract": "Simple Summary International guidelines recommend multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) of the prostate for use by radiologists to identify lesions containing clinically significant prostate cancer, prior to confirmatory biopsy. Automatic assessment of prostate mpMRI using artificial intelligence algorithms holds a currently unrealized potential to improve the diagnostic accuracy achievable by radiologists alone, improve the reporting consistency between radiologists, and enhance reporting quality. In this work, we introduce AutoProstate: a deep learning-powered framework for automatic MRI-based prostate cancer assessment. In particular, AutoProstate utilizes patient data and biparametric MRI to populate an automatic web-based report which includes segmentations of the whole prostate, prostatic zones, and candidate clinically significant prostate cancer lesions, and in addition, several derived characteristics with clinical value are presented. Notably, AutoProstate performed well in external validation using the PICTURE study dataset, suggesting value in prospective multicentre validation, with a view towards future deployment into the prostate cancer diagnostic pathway. Abstract Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) of the prostate is used by radiologists to identify, score, and stage abnormalities that may correspond to clinically significant prostate cancer (CSPCa). Automatic assessment of prostate mpMRI using artificial intelligence algorithms may facilitate a reduction in missed cancers and unnecessary biopsies, an increase in inter-observer agreement between radiologists, and an improvement in reporting quality. In this work, we introduce AutoProstate, a deep learning-powered framework for automatic MRI-based prostate cancer assessment. AutoProstate comprises of three modules: Zone-Segmenter, CSPCa-Segmenter, and Report-Generator. Zone-Segmenter segments the prostatic zones on T2-weighted imaging, CSPCa-Segmenter detects and segments CSPCa lesions using biparametric MRI, and Report-Generator generates an automatic web-based report containing four sections: Patient Details, Prostate Size and PSA Density, Clinically Significant Lesion Candidates, and Findings Summary. In our experiment, AutoProstate was trained using the publicly available PROSTATEx dataset, and externally validated using the PICTURE dataset. Moreover, the performance of AutoProstate was compared to the performance of an experienced radiologist who prospectively read PICTURE dataset cases. In comparison to the radiologist, AutoProstate showed statistically significant improvements in prostate volume and prostate-specific antigen density estimation. Furthermore, AutoProstate matched the CSPCa lesion detection sensitivity of the radiologist, which is paramount, but produced more false positive detections.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Objectives</h4>We aimed to assess inter-radiologist agreement when interpreting pelvic MRI in children with newly diagnosed perianal Crohn's disease (CD).<h4>Materials and methods</h4>In this retrospective multi-reader study, we identified pediatric patients (< 18 years of age) who underwent a pelvic MRI examination for newly diagnosed perianal CD. Images were de-identified and uploaded to a cloud-based image platform for review by 13 fellowship-trained pediatric radiologists The reviewers assessed for the presence of a fistula and abscess, categorization of different imaging findings, and classification using the Parks and St James' University Hospital systems. Fleiss' kappa (κ) statistics and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were used to measure inter-reader agreement, along with 95% confidence intervals (CI).<h4>Results</h4>Forty-six patients were included in our study (median age = 13.0 years [IQR: 10.5 to 16.0 years]); thirty-five (76.1%) were boys. Most imaging features showed fair agreement (κ = 0.21 to 0.35). There was moderate agreement for categorical fistula length (κ = 0.42 [95% CI: 0.32 to 0.53]), involvement of the genitalia (κ = 0.45 [95% CI: 0.26 to 0.63]), and presence of an abscess/collection (κ = 0.52 [95% CI: 0.31 to 0.73]). Maximum abscess/collection length had good agreement (ICC = 0.81 [95% CI: 0.41, 1.00]). There was an almost equal split (yes vs. no: 50.7% vs. 49.3%) regarding whether postcontrast T1-weighted images added value compared to T2-weighted images alone across all radiologists and examinations.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Inter-radiologist agreement when interpreting pelvic MRI for perianal CD in children is fair for most imaging features, with fewer features demonstrating moderate or good agreement.<h4>Key points</h4>Question Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used for diagnosing and monitoring children with perianal Crohn's disease (CD). Limited information is known about inter-radiologist agreement. Findings Agreement between pediatric radiologists when interpreting MRI for perianal CD in children is only fair for most imaging features (κ = 0.21 to 0.35). Clinical relevance Understanding MRI inter-radiologist agreement is crucial to improve the reliability of pelvic MRI in children with perianal Crohn's disease since it may affect patient management (e.g., surgery); further radiologist education and improved imaging feature definitions may help improve inter-radiologist agreement.",

      "abstract": "Objective: Our study aimed to evaluate and validate PanSegNet, a deep learning (DL) algorithm for pediatric pancreas segmentation on MRI in children with acute pancreatitis (AP), chronic pancreatitis (CP), and healthy controls. Methods: With IRB approval, we retrospectively collected 84 MRI scans (1.5T/3T Siemens Aera/Verio) from children aged 2-19 years at Gazi University (2015-2024). The dataset includes healthy children as well as patients diagnosed with AP or CP based on clinical criteria. Pediatric and general radiologists manually segmented the pancreas, then confirmed by a senior pediatric radiologist. PanSegNet-generated segmentations were assessed using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95). Cohen's kappa measured observer agreement. Results: Pancreas MRI T2W scans were obtained from 42 children with AP/CP (mean age: 11.73 +/- 3.9 years) and 42 healthy children (mean age: 11.19 +/- 4.88 years). PanSegNet achieved DSC scores of 88% (controls), 81% (AP), and 80% (CP), with HD95 values of 3.98 mm (controls), 9.85 mm (AP), and 15.67 mm (CP). Inter-observer kappa was 0.86 (controls), 0.82 (pancreatitis), and intra-observer agreement reached 0.88 and 0.81. Strong agreement was observed between automated and manual volumes (R^2 = 0.85 in controls, 0.77 in diseased), demonstrating clinical reliability. Conclusion: PanSegNet represents the first validated deep learning solution for pancreatic MRI segmentation, achieving expert-level performance across healthy and diseased states.

      "abstract": "Fetal MRI is increasingly used to investigate fetal lung pathologies, and super-resolution (SR) algorithms could be a powerful clinical tool for this assessment. Our goal was to investigate whether SR reconstructions result in an improved agreement in lung volume measurements determined by different raters, also known as inter-rater reliability. In this single-center retrospective study, fetal lung volumes calculated from both SR reconstructions and the original images were analyzed. Three radiologists manually segmented the fetal lungs and rated the image quality of all images and reconstructions. Fetal lung volumes were calculated, and the coefficient of variation (CV) was determined for each set of images. Bland–Altman plots were generated, and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated. A one-sided paired Wilcoxon test was used to compare the fetal lung volume CVs, and a two-sided paired t-test was used to compare the lung volumes. The quality ratings were compared using a two-sided paired Wilcoxon test. A total of 98 fetal scans with gestational ages from 19 to 37 weeks were evaluated. There was a significantly lower CV in the lung volumes segmented from the SR reconstructions (p < 0.001), and the ICCs of the reconstructions were higher than those determined from the original images. Bland–Altman plots demonstrated better agreement in the SR reconstruction lung volumes. No significant differences in quality ratings or lung volumes were found. SR reconstructions of the fetal lungs in MRI enabled better inter-rater reliability of fetal lung volume assessment. SR reconstructions of the fetal body, obtained through fetal MRI, can be a valuable tool for improving the inter-rater reliability of fetal lung volume measurements, a crucial clinical biomarker for assessing fetal development and predicting pregnancy outcomes. Deformable slice-to-volume reconstructions of fetal body MRI could be a valuable clinical tool. Quantitative advantages of fetal body MRI reconstructions need to be proven.

      "abstract": "\n Background:\n White matter disease is a common phenomenon in patients with sickle cell disease, that has been linked to cognitive impairment. However, there is no standardized approach for quantification of the cerebral disease burden. The Fazekas score is widely used to quantify the burden of white matter disease in chronic small vessel disease. However, its utility in sickle cell disease has not yet been established. We aimed to assess its, interrater reliability in this patient population.\n \n \n Methods:\n A patient cohort was compiled for the purpose of a research ethics board (REB) approved retrospective study of consecutive adult patients with sickle cell disease, each of whom underwent MRI/MRA between the year 2017 and 2019. All MRI/MRA studies were performed on 3-Tesla MRI. Two neuroradiologists independently assessed the axial FLAIR MRI brain sequence, for all patients, with the sole focus of assigning a Fazekas score (0-3) to each study, as a means of quantifying the burden of ischemic white matter lesions. The neuroradiologists were blinded to the scoring assigned by their counterpart and to the clinical information.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of UPA in pCD.\n \n \n \n This retrospective analysis utilized data on adults (>17 years) who initiated UPA at 45 mg/day for active pCD across 10 centers in the United States and Canada. Standardized data extraction and entry protocols were followed. The primary outcome was clinical response, defined as a ≥3-point reduction in Perianal Disease Activity Index (PDAI) between baseline and follow-up. Secondary outcomes included normalization of CRP (<5 mg/L) or hsCRP (<1 mg/L), clinical remission (PDAI ≤4), and rates of hospitalization, antibiotic use, corticosteroid initiation, and new pCD-related surgeries. Fistula healing on MRI pelvis fistula protocol was defined as an absence of T2-weighted hyperintensity and post-contrast enhancement on T1-weighted images. Predictive analyses used Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate baseline factors influencing time to PDAI remission, including BMI, CRP, albumin, PDAI, pCD disease duration, Montreal location and prior biologic exposure (<2 vs 2+).\n \n \n \n A total of 81 patients were treated with UPA for pCD (median age 35 years and 54.3% male).

      "abstract": "This study aimed to determine the diagnostic performance of contrasted magnetic resonance cholangiography for detecting bile duct lesions following cholecystectomy. A retrospective case series study was conducted that included patients over 18 years of age with suspected bile duct injury after cholecystectomy, who underwent contrasted magnetic resonance cholangiography, and who also had endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, surgery, or subsequent clinical follow-up. The images were interpreted by two radiologists who assigned the type of lesion according to the Strasberg classification. Qualitative variables were represented by frequencies and proportions, while quantitative variables were described using measures of central tendency and dispersion. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were assessed, along with interobserver variability, using the kappa index. We included 20 patients with a median age of 51.5 years (interquartile range: 35), and 14 (70%) were women. In all 20 patients, lesions were identified on magnetic resonance cholangiography, of which 19 were confirmed with the gold standard for a positive predictive value of 100% (hepatobiliary-specific contrast agents) and 92% (extracellular contrast). The most frequent lesions were Strasberg E2 and E4 in five patients each. The kappa index was 1 in determining the presence or absence of bile duct injury and 0.9 in the Strasberg classification. Contrasted magnetic resonance cholangiography is a method with high positive predictive value and almost perfect interobserver agreement for diagnosing bile duct lesions after cholecystectomy.",

      "abstract": "Background Fatty infiltration of the paraspinal muscles may play a role in pain and disability in lumbar spinal stenosis. We assessed the reliability and association with clinical symptoms of a method for assessing fatty infiltration, a simplified muscle fat index (MFI). Methods Preoperative axial T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 243 patients aged 66.6 ± 8.5 years (mean ± standard deviation), 119 females (49%), with symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis were assessed. Fatty infiltration was assessed using both the MFI and the Goutallier classification system (GCS). The MFI was calculated as the signal intensity of the psoas muscle divided by that of the multifidus and erector spinae. Observer reliability was assessed in 102 consecutive patients for three independent investigators by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and 95% limits of agreement (LoA) for continuous variables and Gwet’s agreement coefficient (AC1) for categorical variables. Associations with patient-reported pain and disability were assessed using univariate and multivariate regression analyses. Results Interobserver reliability was good for the MFI (ICC 0.79) and fair for the GCS (AC1 0.33). Intraobserver reliability was good or excellent for the MFI (ICC range 0.86–0.91) and moderate to almost perfect for the GCS (AC1 range 0.55–0.92). Mean interobserver differences of MFI measurements ranged from -0.09 to -0.04 (LoA -0.32 to 0.18). Adjusted for potential confounders, none of the disability or pain parameters was significantly associated with MFI or GCS. Conclusion The proposed MFI demonstrated high observer reliability but was not associated with preoperative pain or disability.",

      "abstract": "Purpose: To characterize the non-laminar flow dynamics and resultant decreased wall shear stress (WSS) and high oscillatory shear index (OSI) of the infrarenal abdominal aortic dilatation, cardiac phase-resolved 3D phase-contrast MRI (4D-flow MRI) was performed. Methods: The prospective single-arm study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and included 18 subjects (median 67.5 years) with the dilated infrarenal aorta (median diameter 35 mm). 4D-flow MRI was conducted on a 1.5T MRI system. On 3D streamline images, laminar and non-laminar (i.e., vortex or helical) flow patterns were visually assessed both for the dilated aorta and for the undilated upstream aorta. Cardiac phase-resolved flow velocities, WSS and OSI, were also measured for the dilated aorta and the upstream undilated aorta. Results: Non-laminar flow represented by vortex or helical flow was more frequent and overt in the dilated aorta than in the undilated upstream aorta (P < 0.0156) with a very good interobserver agreement (weighted kappa: 0.82–1.0). The WSS was lower, and the OSI was higher on the dilated aortic wall compared with the proximal undilated segments. In mid-systole, mean spatially-averaged WSS was 0.20 ± 0.016 Pa for the dilated aorta vs. 0.68 ± 0.071 Pa for undilated upstream aorta (P < 0.0001), and OSI on the dilated aortic wall was 0.093 ± 0.010 vs. 0.041 ± 0.0089 (P = 0.013). The maximum values and the amplitudes of the WSS at the dilated aorta were inversely proportional to the ratio of dilated/undilated aortic diameter (r = −0.694, P = 0.0014). Conclusion: 4D-flow can characterize abnormal non-laminar flow dynamics within the dilated aorta in vivo. The wall of the infrarenal aortic dilatation is continuously and increasingly affected by atherogenic stimuli due to the flow disturbances represented by vortex or helical flow, which is reflected by lower WSS and higher OSI.",

For every patient, breath-holding time, body mass index, sex, age were recorded. The phase without contrast media and the arterial phases were independently evaluated by two radiologists who quantified Gibbs artefacts, noise, respiratory motion artefacts and general image quality. Presence or absence of Gibbs artefacts and noise was compared by the McNemar's test. Respiratory motion artefacts and image quality scores were compared using Wilcoxon signed rank test. Interobserver agreement was assessed by Cohen kappa statistics.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared with TWIST-VIBE, CAIPIRINHA-VIBE images had better scores for every parameter except higher noise score. Triple arterial phases were always acquired with TWIST-VIBE but failed in 37% using CAIPIRINHA-VIBE: 11% have only one arterial phase, 26% have two. Breath-holding time was the only parameter that influenced the success of multi-arterial techniques. TWIST-VIBE images had worst score for Gibbs and respiratory motion artefacts but lower noise score.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCAIPIRINHA-VIBE images were always diagnostic, but with a failure of triple-arterial phase in 37%. TWIST-VIBE was successful in obtaining three arterial phases in all patients. Breath-holding time is the only parameter which can influence the preliminary choice between CAIPIRINHA-VIBE and TWIST-VIBE algorithm.\n\n\nADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE\nIf the patient is expected to perform good breath-holds, TWIST-VIBE is preferable; otherwise, CAIPIRINHA-VIBE is more appropriate.",

Multiple imagining methods are available to evaluate it, among which magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most advanced noninvasive preoperative method. However, it is limited in its visualization function. AIM To investigate the use of intraluminal MRI for perianal fistulas via a novel direct MRI fistulography method. METHODS We mixed 3% hydrogen peroxide (HP) with gadolinium for HPMRI fistulography, retrospectively analyzing 60 cases of complex/recurrent fistula-in-ano using physical examination, trans-perineal ultrasonography (TPUS), low-spatial-resolution MRI, and high-resolution direct HPMRI fistulography. We assessed detection rates of fistula tracks, internal openings, their relationship with anal sphincters, and perianal abscesses using statistical analyses, including interobserver agreement (Kappa statistic), and compared results with intraoperative findings. RESULTS Surgical confirmation in 60 cases showed that high-resolution direct HPMRI fistulography provided superior detection rates for internal openings (153) and fistula tracks (162) compared to physical exams, TPUS, and low-spatial-resolution MRI (Z > 5.7, P < 0.05). The effectiveness of physical examination and TPUS was also inferior to that of our method for detecting perianal abscesses (54) (Z = 6.773, 3.694, P < 0.05), whereas that of low-spatial-resolution MRI was not significantly different (Z = 1.851, P = 0.06). High-resolution direct HPMRI fistulography also achieved the highest interobserver agreement (Kappa: 0.89, 0.85, and 0.80), while low-spatial-resolution MRI showed moderate agreement (Kappa: 0.78, 0.74, and 0.69). TPUS and physical examination had lower agreement (Kappa range: 0.33-0.63). CONCLUSION High-resolution direct HPMRI fistulography enhances the visualization of recurrent and complex fistula-in-ano, including branched fistulas, allowing for precise planning and improved surgical outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Internal hydrocephalus is the most common malformation of the central nervous system in dogs. Although the grades of ventricular distension have importance for long-term prognosis, there is no standard classification scheme describing the grade of the ventricular distension in dogs. Materials and methods Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from 147 dogs of various breed, sex, skull conformation, and weight were reviewed retrospectively and blinded between three observers. Based on objectively assessable morphologic characteristics, the lateral cerebral ventricles were graded as normal, minimally, mildly, moderately, severely enlarged or end stage (grade 0 to grade 5), respectively. Evans’ index or the ventricle brain index was also measured in all animals. Interobserver agreement between a very experienced, experienced, and unexperienced person was evaluated by the Spearman coefficient and kappa tests. Additionally, correlation to the ventricle brain index was determined using the Spearman coefficient and F-tests. Results The Spearman correlation coefficient reached a very strong correlation (r = 0.97) between the experienced and very experienced observer and a strong correlation (r = 0.91) between the very experienced and unexperienced observer. The kappa value revealed excellent interobserver agreement between the very experienced and experienced observers (weighted kappa 0.91) and moderate between the very experienced and unexperienced observers (weighted kappa 0.75). The ventricular-brain index correlated (r = 0.94, Spearman coefficient test) with the grading system, indicating that a more elevated ratio was related to a more advanced degree of ventricular enlargement. The interobserver agreement with regard to the grade between the neurologist in training and a board-certified neurologist was excellent and between the board-certified neurologist and general practitioner achieved lower values. Conclusion The presented MRI-based grading of ventricular enlargement is a reliable and functional method for an objective grading of the ventricular system in dogs. Some experience in MRI and brain anatomy is needed for interpretation and grading.",

Material and methods A total of 348 knees of 308 patients were analysed retrospectively with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patients with or without CP constituted the study and the control groups in this cross-sectional investigation. Two reviewers interpreted the dataset regarding the SP-ET index. This ratio was calculated as the distance between the most superior point of patella and the entrance of femoral trochlea (β) divided by the patellar articular surface length (α). The relationship between the SP-ET index and CP was presented using independent samples T-tests, and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated to reveal the interobserver differences. Results There was excellent agreement between the reviewers regarding α, β, and SP-ET values (ICC was 0.971, 0.964, and 0.943, respectively). Higher SP-ET values were obtained for patients with CP, in comparison with patients without any chondral lesion (p < 0.001). A significant, positive, and moderate level of correlation was revealed between SP-ET measurements and CP grades for the total study population. Conclusions SP-ET index showed high interobserver agreement and indicated a significant difference between patients with and without CP.

This single-centre retrospective study included patients from 2019 to 2022 with sonographically indeterminate or solid ovarian masses who underwent MRI with a specific protocol for characterisation according to O-RADS MRI specifications. Each study was evaluated using O-RADS lexicon by two radiologists, one with 17 years of experience in gynaecological radiology and another with 4 years of experience in general radiology. Findings were classified as benign, borderline, or malignant according to histology or stability over time. Diagnostic performance and interobserver agreement were assessed. A total of 183 patients with US indeterminate or solid adnexal masses were included. Fifty-seven (31%) did not have ovarian masses, classified as O-RADS 1. The diagnostic performance for scores 2–5 was excellent with a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 97.4%, 100%, 96.2%, and 100%, respectively by the experienced radiologist and 96.1%, 92.0%, 93.9%, and 94.8% by the inexperienced radiologist. Interobserver concordance was very high (Kappa index 0.92). Almost all the misclassified cases were due to misinterpretation of the classification similar to reports in the literature. The diagnostic performance of O-RADS MRI determined by either experienced or inexperienced radiologists is excellent, facilitating decision-making with high diagnostic accuracy and high reproducibility. Knowledge of this classification and use of assessment tools could avoid frequent errors due to misinterpretation. Up to 31% of ovarian masses are considered indeterminate by transvaginal US and 32% of solid lesions considered malignant by transvaginal US are benign. The O-RADs MRI accurately classifies these masses, even when used by inexperienced radiologists, thereby avoiding incorrect surgical approaches. • O-RADS MRI accurately classifies indeterminate and solid ovarian masses by ultrasound. • There is excellent interobserver agreement between experienced and non-experienced radiologists. • O-RADS MRI is a helpful tool to assess clinical decision-making in ovarian tumours.",

Regions of interest (ROI) were delineated on non-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), high b-value diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) images; radiomic features were subsequently extracted. The most significant radiomic features were selected using the t-test and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator with cross-validation (LASSO-CV). We identified clinical risk factors for clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (CR-POPF) using univariate logistic regression. Ten distinct machine learning algorithms were used to develop radiomics and clinical models, which were then integrated via weighted voting. Model performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calibration curves.<h4>Results</h4>Eight radiomic features and one clinical feature (BMI) were selected for model construction. Among the ten machine learning algorithms, the Random Forest (RF) algorithm yielded the optimal radiomics model, achieving an AUC of 0.702, an F1-score of 0.571, and an accuracy of 0.857 in the test set. The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm produced the optimal clinical model, with corresponding values of 0.846, 0.640, and 0.786. Finally, the integrated model, developed using a weighted voting strategy, demonstrated superior comprehensive performance with an AUC of 0.899, showing excellent discrimination and calibration.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The machine learning model using preoperative multi-sequence MRI radiomic features showed moderate predictive value for CR-POPF risk, which was significantly enhanced by integrating BMI.",

All patients with perianal CD treated with anti-TNF-α therapy at our tertiary care center were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical assessment. Two MR examinations were performed: at initiation of anti-TNF-α treatment and then at least 2 years after. Clinical assessment (remission, response and non-response) was based on Present's criteria. Rectoscopic patterns, MRI Van Assche score, and MRI fistula activity signs (T2 signal and contrast enhancement) were collected for the two MR examinations. Fistula healing was defined as the absence of T2 hyperintensity and contrast enhancement on MRI. Deep remission was defined as the association of both clinical remission, absence of anal canal ulcers and healing on MRI. Characteristics and imaging patterns of patients with and without deep remission were compared by univariate and multivariate analyses. Forty-nine consecutive patients (31 females and 18 males) were included. They ranged in age from 14-70 years (mean, 33 years). MRI and clinical assessment were performed after a mean period of exposure to anti-TNF-α therapy of 40 ± 3.7 mo. Clinical remission, response and non-response were observed in 53.1%, 20.4%, and 26.5% of patients, respectively. Deep remission was observed in 32.7% of patients. Among the 26 patients in clinical remission, 10 had persisting inflammation of fistulas on MRI (T2 hyperintensity, <i>n</i> = 7; contrast enhancement, <i>n</i> = 10). Univariate analysis showed that deep remission was associated with the absence of rectal involvement and the absence of switch of anti-TNF-α treatment or surgery requirement. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that only the absence of rectal involvement (OR = 4.6; 95%CI: 1.03-20.5) was associated with deep remission. Deep remission is achieved in approximately one third of patients on maintenance anti-TNF-α therapy. Absence of rectal involvement is predictive of deep remission.",

Radiomic features were then extracted using an in-house software based on pyradiomics applying Wavelet and Gaussian filters. LASSO algorithm was employed to select correlated features with outcome and summarize them in a radiomic signature. Using radiomic signature alone and then merged with meaningful clinical data we trained ML-algorithms using 70% of cases for training/validation, with a 10-fold internal cross-validation, and 30% for model testing. Model performance was assessed using AUC with a 95% confidence interval (CI).\n \n \n \n Seventy coupled tests (63 patients) were included and randomly subdivided into a training/validation cohort (n = 50) and a test cohort (n = 20). Median follow-up was 24.73 months (interquartile range 13.64-46.57). Radiomic model had an AUC of 0.88 (95%_CI 0.70-0.97) in training and 0.57 (95%_CI 0.23-0.86) in test cohort. Radiomic-clinical mixed model had an AUC of 0.90 (95%_CI 0.73-0.98) in training and 0.66 (95%_CI 0.33-0.88) in test cohort.\n \n \n \n We produced an MRI radiomic-based ML algorithm with good prediction ability for future graft failure in patients with kidney transplant. Given the limited number of enrolled patients, validation in larger (and ideally prospective) cohorts is required to confirm our findings. Comparison of radiomic-based ML with histological parameters (i.e., IFTA) for the prediction of graft failure in our cohort is currently under assessment.\n",

      "abstract": "Purpose To analyze the performance of deep learning (DL) models for segmentation of the neonatal lung in MRI and investigate the use of automated MRI-based features for assessment of neonatal lung disease. Materials and Methods Quiet-breathing MRI was prospectively performed in two independent cohorts of preterm infants (median gestational age, 26.57 weeks; IQR, 25.3–28.6 weeks; 55 female and 48 male infants) with (n = 86) and without (n = 21) chronic lung disease (bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD]). Convolutional neural networks were developed for lung segmentation, and a three-dimensional reconstruction was used to calculate MRI features for lung volume, shape, pixel intensity, and surface. These features were explored as indicators of BPD and disease-associated lung structural remodeling through correlation with lung injury scores and multinomial models for BPD severity stratification. Results The lung segmentation model reached a volumetric Dice coefficient of 0.908 in cross-validation and 0.880 on the independent test dataset, matching expert-level performance across disease grades. MRI lung features demonstrated significant correlations with lung injury scores and added structural information for the separation of neonates with BPD (BPD vs no BPD: average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.92 ± 0.02 [SD]; no or mild BPD vs moderate or severe BPD: average AUC, 0.84 ± 0.03). Conclusion This study demonstrated high performance of DL models for MRI neonatal lung segmentation and showed the potential of automated MRI features for diagnostic assessment of neonatal lung disease while avoiding radiation exposure.

This study evaluated the predictive value of degree of fibrosis and disease activity (MAGNIFI-CD index) at MRI for long-term clinical closure of Crohn’s perianal fistulas. Methods Crohn’s disease [CD] patients treated with surgical closure following anti-tumour necrosis factor [anti-TNF] induction or anti-TNF alone for high perianal fistulas as part of a patient preference randomized controlled trial [PISA-II] between 2013 and 2020 with a post-treatment MRI and long-term clinical follow-up data were retrospectively included. Two radiologists scored the degree of fibrosis and MAGNIFI-CD index at pre- and post-treatment MRI. The accuracy of post-treatment MRI findings in predicting long-term clinical closure [12 months after the MRI] was evaluated using receiver operating characteristics [ROC] analysis. Results Fifty patients were included: 31 female, median age 33 years (interquartile range [IQR] 26–45).

This study aimed to verify the association of MRE metrics with histologic fibrosis independent of inflammation.<h4>Methods</h4>This prospective European multicenter study performed MRE imaging on 60 patients with CD with bowel strictures before surgical resection. Locations of 61 histological samples were annotated on MRE examinations, followed by central readings using the Chiorean score and measurement of delayed gain of enhancement (DGE), magnetization transfer ratio, T2-weighted MRI sequences (T2R), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and the magnetic resonance index of activity (MaRIA). Correlations of histology and MRE metrics were assessed. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were used to select composite MRE scores predictive of histology and to estimate their predictive value.<h4>Results</h4>ADC and MaRIA correlated with fibrosis (R = -0.71, P < 0.0001, and 0.59, P < 0.001) and more moderately with inflammation (R = -0.35, P < 0.01, and R = 0.53, P < 0.001). Lower or no correlations of fibrosis or inflammation were found with DGE, magnetization transfer ratio, or T2R. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator and ROC identified a composite score of MaRIA, ADC, and DGE as a very good predictor of histologic fibrosis (ROC area under the curve = 0.910). MaRIA alone was the best predictor of histologic inflammation with excellent performance in identifying active histologic inflammation (ROC area under the curve = 0.966).<h4>Discussion</h4>MRE-based scores for histologic fibrosis and inflammation may assist in the characterization of CD stenosis and enable development of fibrosis-targeted therapies and clinical treatment of stenotic patients.",

Twenty children with ileal CD (8 girls; mean age = 14.0 years) between May 2019 and April 2021 underwent research MRI at three time points—diagnosis, 6 weeks, and 6 months into treatment. For each examination, a radiologist measured the maximum wall thickness and length of disease. Then, the inflamed ileum was manually and semi-automatically segmented to measure the tissue volume. Mixed-effects models were used to assess the changes over time. Intra-class correlation was used to assess agreement between manual and semi-automated segmentation. Length of disease decreased with medical treatment (19.2 vs. 12.2 vs. 8.0 cm; p = 0.002), 36% from baseline to 6 weeks and 58% from baseline to 6 months, while maximum bowel wall thickness also decreased over time (7.6 vs. 5.8 vs. 4.5 mm; p < 0.0001), 24% from baseline to 6 weeks and 41% from baseline to 6 months. Manual volumetric measurements demonstrated a significant treatment response (19.8 vs.11.6 vs.5.1 mL; p < 0.0001), 41% decrease from baseline to 6 weeks and 74% from baseline to 6 months. Using semi-automated segmentation, the volume decreased significantly over time as well (24.0 vs.15.1 vs.9.1 mL; p = 0.0007), 37% from baseline to 6 weeks and 62% from baseline to 6 months. There was good agreement between manual and semi-automated volumetric assessments (ICC = 0.78 [95% CI: 0.57–0.88]). Volumetric measurement of inflammation is responsive to medical treatment in CD and, as percentage compared to baseline, may show greater treatment response than linear measurements. QuestionVolumetric measurements of intestinal inflammation related to Crohn disease may be superior to traditional linear measurements. FindingsVolumetric measurements showed greater treatment response when compared to linear measurements, and there was good agreement between manual and semi-automated volumetric measurements of intestinal inflammation.

Magnetic resonance imaging is the gold standard for evaluating fistula healing in pfCD, but variability in radiological definitions hampers meaningful clinical interpretation and consistent trial design. This study aimed to establish an international consensus on the definition of radiological healing in pfCD. The study was conducted in 2 phases. Phase 1 involved a systematic review to identify magnetic resonance imaging-based variables and indices used to define healing in pfCD, assessing methodological quality using the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) framework. Phase 2 utilized a 2-round online Delphi consensus process with 84 international experts, followed by a stakeholder meeting to achieve consensus (agreement threshold >80%). Results were reported as per Accurate Consensus Reporting Document (ACCORD) guidelines. A radiologically healed fistula can be defined by the absence of T2-weighted hyperintensity, a completely fibrotic fistula tract and, when contrast is used, the absence of contrast enhancement on post-contrast T1-weighted images (95% consensus). Radiological improvement of a fistula can be defined (80% consensus) by the presence of a least one essential criterion: an increasingly fibrotic fistula tract, an unequivocal reduction in one or more of the following: T2-weighted hyperintensity, fistula diameter, fistula length, abscess size, or contrast enhancement of the fistula tract. This international Delphi consensus standardizes radiological endpoints in pfCD, improving consistency in clinical and research settings. Future studies will validate this definition and assess how radiological changes predict long-term clinical outcomes and quality of life improvements.",

The aim of the present study was to assess the behavior of perianal fistulas before and after infliximab treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical evaluation were performed in a total of 18 patients before and after treatment with infliximab. An MRI-based score of perianal Crohn's disease severity was developed using both criteria of local extension of fistulas (complexity, supralavetoric extension, relation to the sphincters and of active inflammation (T2 hyperintensity, presence of cavities/abscesses, and rectal wall involvement). The MRI score was reliable in assessing the fistula tracks, with a good interobserver concordance (p < 0.001). Fistula tracks with signs of active inflammation were found in all 18 patients at baseline and collections in seven. After short-term infliximab treatment, active tracks persisted in eight of 11 patients who had clinically responded to infliximab. After long-term (46 wk) infliximab therapy, MRI signs of active track inflammation had resolved in three of six patients. We have developed an MRI-based score of perianal Crohn's disease severity to assess the anatomical evolution of Crohn's fistulas. Our study demonstrates that despite closure of draining external orifices after infliximab therapy, fistula tracks persist with varying degrees of residual inflammation, which may cause recurrent fistulas and pelvic abscesses. Whether complete fistula fibrosis occurs over time with repeated infliximab infusions needs further study.",

Purpose To evaluate the potential value of a machine learning (ML) approach that uses radiomic features from late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and cine images for the prediction of ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VT) in patients with HCM. Material and Methods Hyperenhancing areas of LV myocardium on LGE images were manually segmented, and the segmentation was propagated to corresponding areas on cine images. Radiomic features were extracted using the PyRadiomics library. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was employed for radiomic feature selection. Our model development employed the TabPFN algorithm, an adapted Prior-Data Fitted Network design. Model performance was evaluated graphically and numerically over five-repeat fivefold cross-validation. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were employed to determine the relative importance of selected radiomic features. Results Our cohort consisted of 60 patients with HCM (73.3% male; median age = 51.5 years), among whom 17 had documented VT during the follow-up. A total of 1612 radiomic features were extracted for each patient. The LASSO algorithm led to a final selection of 18 radiomic features. The model achieved a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.877, demonstrating good discrimination, and a mean Brier score of 0.119, demonstrating good calibration. Conclusion Radiomics-based ML models are promising for predicting VT in patients with HCM during the follow-up period.

Using the semi-automated segmentation tool, the volume of inflamed bowel also decreased significantly over time (24.0 vs. 15.1 vs. 9.1 ml; p=0.0007), decreasing 37% between baseline and 6 weeks and 62% between baseline and 6 months. There was good agreement between manual and semi-automated volumetric bowel assessments (ICC=0.78 [95% CI: 0.57-0.88]). ICC between manual and code-estimated Max BWT was 0.60 [95% CI: 0.42, 0.72] with a strong positive correlation (r=0.839; p <0.001) between these two methods as shown in the Figure.\n \n \n \n Volumetric assessments, along with automatic measurements of bowel wall thickness, show promise in accurately assessing treatment response in pediatric CD. These methods might provide more consistent and repeatable measurements, essential for long-term disease monitoring and management.\n",

      "abstract": "\n \n \n To bolster Crohn’s disease (CD) clinical trial and research infrastructure through the development and validation of a sensitive, multifactorial, disease-specific, patient-reported outcome measure (PRO) for patient monitoring in therapeutic trials of CD.\n \n \n \n As therapeutic advancements are made in the field of CD, it is vital to have a fully validated, sensitive, and reliable, disease-specific PRO to accurately measure changes in disease burden. Importantly, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has encouraged the use of PROs to measure therapeutic benefit of new treatments on patient populations. This research describes the creation, testing, and validation of a new, multifactorial PRO: The Crohn’s Disease-Health Index (CD-HI).\n \n \n \n Questions were selected for the CD-HI based on their importance to patients, potential to respond to therapeutic benefit, reliability, internal consistency, and generalizability (Figure 1). We beta tested the CD-HI to evaluate its clarity, ease of use, and applicability to the CD patient population. We performed test-retest reliability, known groups validity, internal consistency, and area under the curve (AUC) analyses.\n \n \n \n The final version of the CD-HI contains 12 subscales that measure disease burden in the following areas: 1) fatigue, 2) dietary restrictions, 3) gastrointestinal health, 4) sleep and daytime sleepiness, 5) bowel and bladder function, 6) emotional wellbeing, 7) joint health, 8) pain, 9) neck and back health, 10) activity participation, 11) social wellbeing, and 12) skin health. The CD-HI also provides a composite measure of total disease burden. Fifteen participants participated in beta testing and identified the CD-HI as easy to use, clear, relevant, and comprehensive. Twenty-three individuals with CD participated in test-retest reliability testing of the CD-HI, which indicated a high reliability of the individual questions, subscales, and full instrument (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.84 for the full instrument). The CD-HI and its subscales demonstrated a high internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.98 for the full instrument). The CD-HI total and subscale scores successfully distinguished between patient cohorts with differing disease severity. AUC analysis demonstrated a high sensitivity and specificity of the CD-HI in distinguishing between those with CD on disability vs. not on disability, with an AUC value of 0.9087 (Figure 2).\n \n \n \n The CD-HI is a fully validated, sensitive, and accurate marker of disease burden in CD. This disease-specific PRO is available for use by researchers, clinicians, patient organizations, and companies to monitor patients and measure disease burden during therapeutic trials\n",

The Crohn’s Disease Patient-reported Outcomes Signs and Symptoms (CD-PRO/SS) measure was developed to standardize the quantification of gastrointestinal S&S of CD through direct report from patient ratings.MethodsThe CD-PRO/SS was developed based on data from concept elicitation (focus groups, interviews; n = 29), then refined through cognitive interviews of CD patients (n = 20). Measurement properties, including item-level statistics, scaling structure, reliability, and validity, were examined using secondary analyses of baseline and two-week clinical trial data of adults with moderate-to-severe CD (n = 238).ResultsFindings from qualitative interviews identified nine S&S items covering bowel and abdominal symptoms. The final CD-PRO/SS daily diary includes two scales: Bowel S&S (three items) and Abdominal Symptoms (three items), each scored separately. Each scale showed evidence of adequate reliability (α = 0.74 and 0.67, respectively); reproducibility (intraclass correlation coefficient > 0.80), and validity, with the last including moderate correlations with the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire bowel symptom score and select items (ranging from r = 0.43–0.54). Scores distinguished patients categorized by patient global ratings of disease severity (p < 0.0001).ConclusionsResults suggest the CD-PRO/SS is a reliable and valid measure of gastrointestinal symptom severity in CD patients.

This study aimed to assess both short- and long-term effectiveness of UST in PFCD and to identify thresholds predicting fistula clinical remission. This retrospective cohort included 89 PFCD patients treated with UST. Evaluations utilized the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI), Perianal Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (PDAI), and Fistula Drainage Assessment (FDA). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the Van Assche Index (VAI) was performed at 52 weeks. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves identified UST trough levels predictive of clinical remission. The fistula clinical remission rates were 66.3% (59/89) at 16/20 weeks and 74.2% (66/89) at 52 weeks. Biochemical markers, including CRP, ESR, and PLT, significantly decreased, while RBC and HB levels increased after treatment (p < 0.05). MRI showed fistula improvement in 54.7% (35/64) of patients and complete healing in 21.8% (14/64). Comparative analysis revealed that anti-TNF-naïve patients had significantly higher rates of fistula remission, whereas seton insertion did not affect long-term fistula healing. ROC analysis identified UST trough concentrations ≥3.95 µg/mL at 16/20 weeks as predictive of clinical fistula remission (AUC: 0.791; sensitivity: 73.8%; specificity: 78.6%). UST achieves 74.2% fistula clinical remission at 52 weeks in PFCD, with trough concentrations at 16/20 weeks predictive of clinical remission. These findings support the use of therapeutic drug monitoring(TDM) to optimize clinical outcomes.",

The objective of this study is to compare the turbo inversion recovery magnitude (TIRM) and frequency selective fat saturation turbo spin echo (FSTSE) MRI sequences in detecting perianal fistulas in terms of time and clarity. The MRI protocol included a coronal T2 turbo inversion recovery magnitude sequence, a T2 fat saturation turbo spin echo, and T2 turbo inversion recovery magnitude sequences in the axial plane. The evaluation of sequence image quality involved calculating the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). Additionally three radiologists assessed the best image using a questionnaire designed to align with the study’s objectives. The T2 TIRM sequence was found to have the highest number of ticked images. The inter-rater kappa agreement showed fair agreement (k = 0.370) between the raters. However, the SNR and CNR values for the T2 FSTSE were higher than those of the T2 TIRM sequence, with a p-value less than 0.001. There is a significant difference in the meantime in that the T2 TIRM sequence has less time than the T2 FSTSE with a p-value < 0.001. Due to its uniform fat suppression in the MR image and shorter acquisition time, the turbo inversion recovery magnitude sequence exhibited superior performance compared to the T2 frequency-selective turbo spin echo sequence.",

However no current, widely accepted, reproducible activity index exists to facilitate consistent IUS identification of inflammatory activity. The aim of this study is to identify key parameters of CD inflammation on IUS, evaluate their reliability, and develop an IUS index reflecting segmental activity. Methods There were three phases: [1] expert consensus Delphi method to derive measures of IUS activity; [2] an initial, multi-expert case acquisition and expert interpretation of 20 blinded cases, to measure inter-rater reliability for individual measures; [3] refinement of case acquisition and interpretation by 12 international experts, with 30 blinded case reads with reliability assessment and development of a segmental activity score. Results Delphi consensus: 11 experts representing seven countries identified four key parameters including: [1] bowel wall thickness [BWT]; [2] bowel wall stratification; [3] hyperaemia of the wall [colour Doppler imaging]; and [4] inflammatory mesenteric fat. Blind read: each variable exhibited moderate to substantial reliability. Optimal, standardised image and cineloop acquisition were established. Second blind read and score development: intra-class correlation coefficient [ICC] for BWT was almost perfect at 0.96 [0.94–0.98]. All four parameters correlated with the global disease activity assessment and were included in the final International Bowel Ultrasound Segmental Activity Score with almost perfect ICC (0.97 [0.95–0.99, p <0.001]). Conclusions Using expert consensus and standardised approaches, identification of key activity measurements on IUS has been achieved and a segmental activity score has been proposed, demonstrating excellent reliability.",

      "abstract": "Background Range of motion (ROM) is an important aspect of orthopaedic patient assessment. It can be measured at the knee joint by determining the knee flexion angle (KFA) a patient can achieve at extremes of flexion and extension. As with any measurement, the accuracy and reliability of the method used determine its validity. The consistency of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans as compared to the current gold standard of X-ray remains unknown in terms of KFA evaluation. The aim of this study was to assess and compare the reliability of measuring KFA between X-ray and MRI scans. Methods This study included 80 patients (94 knees) who had attended a specialist knee clinic due to varying knee pathologies and undergone both X-ray and MRI scans. Lateral and T1-weighted sagittal imaging views (respectively) were used to measure KFA by two trained observers independently at two separate time points, 8 weeks apart. The data was then statistically analysed and intra- and inter-observer reliability calculated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results The intra-observer reliability for X-ray was 0.96 (P<0.001) and that for MRI was 0.83 (P<0.001). The inter-observer reliability for X-ray was 0.99 (P<0.001) and that for MRI was 0.81 (P<0.001). All the intra-class correlation coefficients were graded as excellent in both the intra- and inter-observer reliability analysis. Overall, the mean KFA was notably higher on X-ray measurements than that on MRI scans. There was a statistically significant difference between Time 1 and Time 2 measurements (17.7° vs. 16.8°) for MRI data (P=0.022). No significant difference was found for X-ray measurements (46.4° vs. 45.6°) in this regard (P=0.182). Conclusions Both X-ray and MRI allow KFA to be measured with an excellent degree of reliability. However, X-ray measurements were overall superior to that of MRI mainly due to the larger field of view of the visible on-screen image which more readily identifies the anatomical landmarks required to measure KFA.",

      "abstract": "Background Managing low back pain (LBP) often involves MRI despite the fact that international guidelines do not recommend routine imaging. To allow us to explore the topic and use this knowledge in further research, a reliable method to review the MRI referrals is needed. Consequently, this study aimed to assess the inter-rater reliability of a method evaluating lumbar spine MRI referrals’ appropriateness. Methods Four inexperienced students (chiropractic master’s students) and a senior clinician (chiropractor) were included as independent raters in this inter-rater reliability study. Lumbar spine MRI referrals from primary care on patients (> 18 years) with LBP with or without leg pain were included. The referrals were classified using a modified version of the American College of Radiology (ACR) imaging appropriateness criteria for LBP. Categories of appropriate referrals included; fractures, cancer, previous surgery, candidate for surgery or suspicion of cauda equina. Inappropriate referrals included lacking information on previous non-surgical treatment, no word on non-surgical treatment duration, or “other reasons” for inappropriate referrals. After two rounds of training and consensus sessions, 50 lumbar spine MRI referrals were reviewed independently by the five raters. Inter-rater reliability was quantified using unweighted Kappa statistics, and the observed agreement was calculated with both a pairwise comparison and an overall five-rater comparison. Results Inter-rater reliability was substantial, with a Kappa value for appropriate vs. inappropriate referrals of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.55–0.89). When six and eight subcategories were evaluated, the Kappa values were 0.77 (95% CI: 0.58–0.91) and 0.82 (95% CI: 0.72–0.92), respectively. The overall percentage of agreement for appropriate and inappropriate referrals was 92% and ranged from 88 to 98% for the pairwise comparisons of the five raters’ results. For the six and eight subcategories, the overall agreement was 92 and 88%, respectively, ranging from 88 to 98% and 84–92%, respectively, for the pairwise comparisons. Conclusion The inter-rater reliability of the evaluation of the appropriateness of lumbar spine MRI referrals, according to the modified ACR-appropriateness criteria, was found to range from substantial to almost perfect and can be used for research and quality assurance purposes.",

Methods: 14 participants (9f/5m, 33 ± 5 years, 176 ± 10 cm, 73 ± 12 kg) underwent 2 consecutive MRI scans (M1,M2) on the same day, followed by 1 MRI scan 13–14 days later (M3) in a mobile 1.5 Tesla MRI. T2 times were calculated in T2 weighted turbo spin-echo-sequences at the spinal level of the third lumbar vertebrae (11 slices, 2 mm slice thickness, 1 mm interslice gap, echo times: 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 ms) for M. erector spinae (ES) and M. multifidius (MF). The following reliability parameter were calculated for the agreement of T2 times between two different investigators (OBS1 & OBS2) on the same MRI (inter-rater reliability, IR) and by one investigator between different MRI of the same participant (intersession variability, IS): Test–Retest Variability (TRV, Differences/Mean*100); Coefficient of Variation (CV, Standard deviation/Mean*100); Bland–Altman Analysis (systematic bias = Mean of the Differences; Upper/Lower Limits of Agreement = Bias+/−1.96*SD); Intraclass Correlation Coefficient 3.1 (ICC) with absolute agreement, as well as its 95% confidence interval. Results: Mean TRV for IR was 2.6% for ES and 4.2% for MF. Mean TRV for IS was 3.5% (ES) and 5.1% (MF). Mean CV for IR was 1.9 (ES) and 3.0 (MF). Mean CV for IS was 2.5% (ES) and 3.6% (MF). A systematic bias of 1.3 ms (ES) and 2.1 ms (MF) were detected for IR and a systematic bias of 0.4 ms (ES) and 0.07 ms (MF) for IS. ICC for IR was 0.94 (ES) and 0.87 (MF). ICC for IS was 0.88 (ES) and 0.82 (MF). Conclusion: Reliable assessment of paraspinal muscle T2 time justifies its use for scientific purposes. The applied technique could be recommended to use for future studies that aim to assess changes of T2 times, e.g. after an intense bout of eccentric exercises.",

      "abstract": "Objectives Ultrasound measurement of the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) is a rapid, non-invasive means to indirectly assess intracranial pressure. Previous research has demonstrated the ability of emergency physicians to measure ONSD accurately with bedside ultrasound when compared to CT scan or MRI, however the reliability of this measurement between two or more operators has been called into question (Hassen et al. in J Emerg Med 48:450–457, 2015; Shirodkar et al. in Ind J Crit Care Med 19:466–470, 2015). Given the need for accurate and precise measurement to use this as a screening exam, we sought to determine the inter-rater reliability between ONSD measurements obtained in real time by fellowship-trained emergency ultrasound physicians. Methods Three ultrasound fellowship-trained emergency physicians measured bilateral ONSD of 10 healthy volunteers using a high-frequency linear transducer. The physicians were blinded to the other scanners’ measurements, and no instructions were given other than to obtain the ONSD. Each sonographer measured the ONSD in real time and it was recorded by a research coordinator. All measurements were recorded in millimeters. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated to estimate the inter-rater reliability. Results A total of 60 measurements of ONSD were obtained. The average measurement was 4.3 mm (3.83–4.77). Very little variation was found between the three physicians, with a calculated ICC of 0.82 (95% confidence interval 0.63–0.92). Conclusions ONSD measurement obtained by ultrasound fellowship-trained emergency medicine physicians is a reliable measurement with a high degree of correlation between scanners.",

Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the inter- and intra-rater reliability of the manual measurement method of the abductor hallucis muscle volume in feet with hallux valgus deformities using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patients and Methods: The MRI images of the feet of 15 samples with a hallux valgus deformity were selected in this study. The cross-sectional areas of the abductor hallucis muscle were measured in the cuts along the entire length of the foot and multiplied by slice thickness. Two trained raters performed the measurements. The second rater repeated the measurements after five days to eliminate the memory effect. The intra-rater reliability and inter-rater reliability were assessed based on the intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC (2, 1)] to evaluate the extent of agreement between the raters at a 95% confidence interval. Results: The between- and within-rater ICCs were 0.92 (0.79 - 0.97) and 0.99 (0.97 - 0.99), respectively. The standard error of measurements was also small in both inter-rater (6.2%) and intra-rater (2.1%) reliability analyses. Conclusion: The manually outlined slice-by-slice volume measurement of the abductor hallucis muscle based on MRI images showed excellent inter- and intra-rater reliability. The excellent intra-rater reliability, besides the lower standard error percentage of measurements, indicates the superiority of measurements by a single person. However, further studies with a larger sample size are recommended.",

      "abstract": "Background For diagnostic procedures to be clinically useful, they must be reliable. The interpretation of lumbar spine MRI scans is subject to variability and there is a lack of studies where reliability of multiple degenerative pathologies are rated simultaneously. The objective of our study was to determine the inter-rater reliability of three independent raters evaluating degenerative pathologies seen with lumbar spine MRI. Methods Fifty-nine people, 35 patients with low back pain (LBP) or LBP and leg pain and 24 people without LBP or leg pain, received an MRI of the lumbar spine. Three raters (one radiologist and two chiropractors) evaluated the MRIs for the presence and severity of eight degenerative spinal pathologies using a standardized format: Spondylolisthesis, scoliosis, annular fissure, disc degeneration, disc contour, nerve root compromise, spinal stenosis and facet joint degeneration. Findings were identified and classified at disc level according to type and severity. Raters were instructed to evaluate all study sample persons once to assess inter-rater reliability (fully crossed design). Reliability was calculated using Gwet’s Agreement Coefficients (AC 1 and AC 2 ) and Cohen’s Kappa (κ) and Conger’s extension of Cohen’s. Gwet’s probabilistic benchmarking method to the Landis and Koch scale was used. MRI-findings achieving substantial reliability was considered acceptable. Results Inter-rater reliability for all raters combined, ranged from (Gwet’s AC 1 or AC 2 ): 0.64–0.99 and according to probabilistic benchmarking to the Landis and Koch scale equivalent to moderate to almost perfect reliability. Overall reliability level for individual pathologies was almost perfect reliability for spondylolisthesis, spinal stenosis, scoliosis and annular fissure, substantial for nerve root compromise and disc degeneration, and moderate for facet joint degeneration and disc contour. Conclusion Inter-rater reliability for 3 raters, evaluating 177 disc levels, was found to be overall acceptable for 6 out of 8 degenerative MRI-findings in the lumbar spine. Ratings of facet joint degeneration and disc contour achieved moderate reliability and was considered unacceptable.",

This pilot study evaluated if MaRIA and Clermont scores can serve as surrogates to ileocolonoscopy for assessing interval change in mucosal inflammation in pediatric CD post-induction treatment.<h4>Methods</h4>Children with known or newly diagnosed ileocolonic CD starting or changing therapy underwent ileocolonoscopy, scored with simple endoscopic score for Crohn's disease (SES-CD), and MRE on the same day at two time points (Week 0 and 12). Accuracy of global MaRIA and Clermont indices relative to ileocolonoscopy in detecting degree of post-treatment interval change in mucosal inflammation was assessed through correlational coefficients (<i>r</i>). Inter-reader agreement was calculated for imaging scores through intraclass correlation (ICC).<h4>Results</h4>Sixteen children (mean age 11.5 ± 2.8) were evaluated. Global MaRIA/Clermont correlated with SES-CD in detecting the degree of change in mucosal inflammation (<i>r</i> = 0.676 and <i>r</i> = 0.677, <i>P</i> < 0.005, respectively). Correlation for pooled timepoint assessments between SES-CD and global MaRIA/Clermont was moderate (<i>r</i> = 0.546, <i>P</i> < 0.001 and <i>r =</i> 0.582, <i>P</i> < 0.001, respectively). Inter-rater reliability for global MaRIA and Clermont was good (ICC = 0.809 and ICC = 0.768, respectively, <i>P</i> < 0.001).<h4>Conclusions</h4>MRE-based global scores correlate with endoscopic indices and may be used to monitor disease changes in children with CD undergoing induction treatment, which can advise the physician if treatment changes should be made.",

Twenty-two consecutive patients with clinical suspicion of perianal sepsis were studied using an endoanal coil followed immediately by a phased array coil. T1-weighted precontrast and postcontrast and STIR images in transverse and coronal planes were produced with each coil and analysed by noting the presence and site of a collection, primary track, the position of any internal opening, and subcutaneous or supralevator extension. An \"expert\" and also a \"trainee\" radiologist assessed the images. Operative findings were similarly recorded. The Fisher exact test was used to compare imaging with surgery. Interobserver variation was calculated using a kappa statistic. Of 22 patients with suspected fistulas, 8 were simple, 4 were complex, and 3 were superficial sinuses. Five had no anal pathology, 1 had anal excoriation, and 1 had a polyp. At surgery, 6 intersphincteric, 1 transsphincteric, 8 extrasphincteric, no supralevator collections, and 9 internal openings were noted. The overall sensitivity and specificity for detecting these were 75% and 64%, respectively, for STIR imaging, and 58.3% and 62.8% for gadolinium-enhanced imaging. There was good agreement between the \"trainee\" and the \"expert\" in the interpretation of images (kappa=0.7). A STIR sequence is more sensitive overall than gadolinium-enhanced techniques on endoanal magnetic resonance imaging of fistulas-in-ano because of increased sensitivity in detecting the internal opening. A combination of endoanal and phased array techniques using STIR imaging sequences is valuable preoperative assessment in both simple and complex cases.",

Abstract Objective  The objectives of this study are to compare absolute values of acromial index (AI) and critical shoulder angle (CSA) obtained in both radiographs and magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the shoulder; and to compare the interobserver and intra-observer agreement for AI and CSA values measured in these image modalities. Methods  Patients who had medical indication of investigating shoulders conditions through radiographs and MRI were included. Images were taken to two fellowship-trained shoulder surgeons, which conducted measurements of AI and CSA in radiographs and in MRI. Twelve weeks after the first evaluation, a second evaluation was conducted. Inter- and intra-observer reliability was presented as an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and agreement was classified according to Landis & Koch criteria. The differences between two measurements were evaluated using Bland-Altman plots. Results  134 shoulders in 124 subjects were included. Mean intra-observer ICC for CSA in X-rays and in MRI were 0.936 and 0.940, respectively; for AI, 0.908 and 0.022. Mean inter-observer ICC for CSA were 0.892 and 0.752 in X-rays and MRI respectively; for AI, ICC values were 0.849 and 0.685. All individual analysis reached statistical power ( p  < 0.001). Mean difference for AI values measured in X-rays and in MRI was 0.01 and 0.03 for observers 1 and 2, respectively. Mean difference for CSA values obtained in X-rays and MRI was 0.16 and 0.58 for observers 1 and 2, respectively. Conclusion  Both MRI and X-rays provided high intra- and interobserver agreement for measurement of AI and CSA. Absolute values found for AI and CSA were highly correlated in both image modalities. These findings suggest that MRI is a suitable method to measure AI and CSA. Level of Evidence II , Diagnostic Study.",

      "abstract": "Objective: This cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the correlation between the necrotic index and the modified necrotic index with the Harris hip score (HHS), as well as to assess their interobserver and intraobserver reliability in patients with osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). Methods: Fifty-four adult patients (88 hips) presenting with atraumatic hip pain and radiographic evidence of ONFH (Ficat-Arlet grades 1 and 2) were included. Participants abstained from analgesics for one week prior to the study. All underwent MRI, and HHS was calculated by a resident uninvolved in the study. The necrotic index was determined using angles obtained from mid-coronal and mid-sagittal MRI slices, whereas the modified necrotic index was derived from angles measured in MRI slices where the necrotic lesion appeared at its largest size. Three senior consultants performed measurements on two separate occasions to assess reliability. Results: Both indices showed significant negative correlations with HHS. The modified necrotic index demonstrated a strong correlation (r = -0.940, p < 0.001), whereas the original necrotic index exhibited a moderate correlation (r = -0.790, p < 0.001). The interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for assessment of lesion size was significant for both indices (p < 0.05), but it was higher for the modified index (ICC = 0.81) compared to the original index (ICC = 0.69). Levene’s test for homogeneity of variance indicated unequal variance across the two methods (p < 0.01). Measurement variance was smaller for the modified index than for the original index (p < 0.01), indicating greater precision. Both methods showed significant interobserver and intraobserver agreement (p < 0.05) Conclusion: Both the necrotic index and the modified necrotic index showed significant negative correlations with HHS. The modified necrotic index demonstrated a strong correlation, whereas the original necrotic index exhibited a moderate correlation. Both methods proved reliable for measuring lesion size, with the modified method showing greater precision. Additionally, both indices demonstrated significant interobserver and intraobserver reliability.",

      "abstract": "Background and Aim: The optimal imaging test for gross tumor volume (GTV) delineation in non-spine bone metastases has not been defined. The use of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) requires accurate target delineation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or 18fludesoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18FDG-PET) allow for better visualization of the extent of bone metastases and optimizes the accuracy of tumor delineation for stereotactic radiotherapy compared to computed tomography (CT) alone. We evaluated the interobserver agreement in GTV of non-spine bone metastases in a single center and compared MRI and/or 18FDG-PET and CT in GTV delineation. Methods: Anonymous CT and MRI and/or 18FDG-PET obtained from 10 non-spine bone metastases were analyzed by six radiation oncologists at our center. Images acquired by CT and MRI and/or 18FDG-PET were used to delineate 10 GTVs of non-spine bone metastases in the pelvis, extremities, and skull. The cases showed different characteristics: blastic and lytic metastases, and different primary cancers (lung, breast, prostate, rectum, urothelial, and biliary). In both CT and MRI and/or 18FDG-PET, the GTV volumes were compared. The index of agreement was evaluated according to Landis and Koch protocol. Results: The GTV volume as defined on MRI was in all cases larger or at least as large as the GTV volume on CT (P=0.25). The median GTV volume on MRI was 3.15 cc (0.027-70.64 cc) compared to 2.8 cc on CT (0.075-77.95 cc). Interobserver variance and standard deviation were lower in CT than MRI (576.3 vs. 722.2 and 24.0 vs. 26.9, respectively). The level of agreement was fair (kappa=0.36) between CT and MRI. The median GTV volume on 18FDG-PET in five patients was 5.8 cc (0.46-64.17 cc), compared to 4.1 cc on CT (0.99-54.2 cc) (P=0.236). Interobserver variance and standard deviation in CT, MRI, and 18FDG-PET were 576.3 versus 722.2 versus 730.5 and 24 versus 26.9 versus 27.0, respectively. The level of agreement was slight (kappa=0.08) between CT and 18FDG-PET. Conclusions: Interobserver variance in non-spine bone metastases was equal when MRI and PET were compared to CT. CT was associated with the lowest variance and standard deviation. Compared to CT GTVs, the GTVs rendered from MRI images had fair agreement, while the GTVs rendered from 18FDG-PET had only slight agreement. Relevance for Patients: The delimitation of the treatment volume in non-spine bone metastases with SBRT is important for the results determining its efficacy. It is therefore essential to know the variability and to manage it to achieve the highest quality of treatment.",

We retrospectively reviewed patients with CD with draining perianal fistulas treated with infliximab and included only those who underwent clinical assessment and MRI before and after infliximab therapy. Among 178 patients who underwent repeated MRI and clinical assessment, 65.2% had complex fistulas. Post-infliximab therapy, 55.1% of patients with perianal fistulizing CD showed clinical remission and 26.4% presented a clinical response; 38.2% had deep radiological remission, and 34.3% had a partial response based on the Ng score; the Van Assche scores decreased obviously compared with baseline. Prolonged infliximab infusion (18 times) presented higher radiological remission rates in patients with CD with complex fistulas. Concomitant treatment with azathioprine increased the fistula healing rate compared with infliximab alone (50% vs. 36.9%, P < 0.001). Younger age at diagnosis of CD, proctitis and requiring perianal surgery were identified as predictors of poor deep radiological remission of fistulas. Eight of ten patients who stopped infliximab and switched to an alternative agent retained a status of fistula healing in the first year of follow-up. Infliximab induced deep radiological remission of perianal fistulas in Chinese patients with CD. Routine MRI should be used to monitor fistula healing.

Performance was evaluated based on calibration, discrimination, reclassification, and clinical utility. Thirteen features combining multiparametric MRI were finally selected. The SVM classifier showed the best performance, with the highest average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.851 in the validation cohorts. The fusion model incorporating SVM-based Rad-scores with clinical T stage and MR-reported lymph node status achieved encouraging predictive performance in the training (AUC = 0.916), internal validation (AUC = 0.903), and external validation (AUC = 0.885) cohorts. Furthermore, the fusion model showed better clinical benefit and higher classification accuracy than the clinical model. The ML-based fusion model based on multiparametric MRI exhibited promise for predicting Ki-67 expression levels in HNSCC patients, which might be helpful for prognosis evaluation and clinical decision-making.",

      "abstract": "Perianal fistulas are a severe, disabling complication of Crohn's disease (CD) occurring in about 20% of patients within 20 years from diagnosis, with a significant impact on patients' quality of life and an increased risk of undergoing major abdominal surgery. A multimodal approach, that is a combination of a surgical approach along medical therapies, mainly infliximab � antibiotics, represents the current standard of care for treatment of complex perianal disease. However, only a minority of patients achieve durable fistula remission, with high rate of recurrence, need for re‐intervention or diverting stoma. The adjunctive topical treatment with expanded allogeneic adipose‐ derived mesenchymal stem cells has demonstrated interesting results in the randomized double‐blind placebo‐controlled adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells for induction of remission (ADMIRE) trial, with up to 50% of fistula remission at week 24. However, the partial beneficial effect, the selective access criteria (no concomitant active luminal disease or active severe proctitis or diverting stoma) and the cost of each treatment denote that novel therapeutic strategies are increasingly needed for complex perianal CD. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), involving intermittent inhalation of 100% oxygen at pressures >1 atm, has shown encouraging results in several CD phenotypes, including inflammatory luminal disease, enterocutaneous fistulas, metastatic perianal disease and fistulizing perianal disease. The underlying involved mechanism seems to be related to the modulation of immune response and the promotion of tissue repair and wound healing mediated by hyperoxygenation. In the current study, Lansdorp et al. reported the long‐term (week 60) follow‐up of 20 patients enrolled in the HOT‐TOPIC trial. At enrolment, all patients had ≥1 actively draining high (defined as transversing theupper two‐thirds of theexternal sphincter/puborectal muscle, regardless of the number of internal and external openings) medical‐refractory perianal fistula for a median duration of 4 years (interquartile range 2–12 years). 16 patients (80%) were on concomitant biological therapy (14 on infliximab, one on vedolizumab and one onustekinumab). Patientswere treatedwith40daily sessions ofHBOT on working days, for a total of 8 weeks. The co‐primary outcome was a comprehensive assessment of the fistula, with a clinical evaluation according to the perianal disease activity index (PDAI) and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment through the modified Van Assche Index at week 16 and 60. At both time‐points, a significant reduction of the median PDAI score (8 vs. 4 vs. 4, p < 0.001 for both comparisons) and of the modified Van Assche Index (9.2 vs. 7.3 vs. 7.7, p = 0.004 and p = 0.005, respectively) was recorded compared to baseline. Moreover, at the end of follow‐up, 12 patients (60%) were in clinical remission (defined as a PDAI score ≤4) and four patients (20%) had a fibrotic fistula complex at MRI. Conversely, the improvement in biochemical (both C‐reactive protein and faecal calprotectin) and patient‐reported outcomes measures achieved at week 16 was no longer present at week 60. During the study, only three patients (15%) required perianal surgical re‐intervention. Overall, these results seem promising, especially considering the clinical features of the population enrolled. However, the greatest limit of this study is the absence of a control group to really assess the effect of the additive treatment with HBOT. As previously shown, in fact, in the ADMIRE trial where 34% of placebo‐treated patients achieved remission, an appropriate surgical procedure (fistula curettage, surgical drainage, and internal orifice closure) plus concomitant medications alone can significantly improve the fistula outcome. To be honest, a small control group of 8 patients unwilling to undergo HBOT was included, but no comparisons were possible. Assuming a potential diffusion of HBOT in clinical practice for perianal fistula, three aspects should be considered: (1) the direct cost for health/insurance system; (2) the indirect cost for patients, treated for 40 working days and (3) the HBOT chambers availability across the IBD centres. In conclusion, complex perianal fistulas represent one of the most challenging aspects of treatment of CD. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy seems to be a potential advance for standard‐of‐care refractory patients. Future larger studies are required to verify the real additive benefit and the cost‐effectiveness assessment of HBOT in this setting of difficult‐to‐treat patients.",

Recent data indicate promising short-term efficacy of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cell (bmMSC) therapy. The aim of this case series is to gather more information on the long-term effectiveness and safety.<h4>Methods</h4>Between 2013 and 2017, bmMSCs were administered under compassionate use to patients at a university hospital in Germany, as no stem cell therapy was approved at the time. Inclusion criteria were inactive CD (Harvey-Bradshaw Index <5) without proctitis, at least one treatment-refractory perianal fistula (with or without rectovaginal additional fistulas) and prior tumour necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor and/or surgical exposure. After curettage of the fistula tract, patients received repeated intrafistular injections with up to 300 million bmMSCs. We retrospectively analysed patient records to assess disease course, clinical fistula remission and radiological activity using the modified van Assche index.<h4>Results</h4>Six female patients with a total of 13 fistulas (9 trans-sphincteric, 2 extrasphincteric and 2 rectovaginal) underwent bmMSC application. Median radiological and clinical long-term follow-up was 80 months (range 44-98 months) after first local bmMSC injection. 8 of 13 fistulas (62%) exhibited complete closure. For rectovaginal fistulas, long-term remission (98 months) was 50% (1 of 2). Pelvic MRI showed a decrease in modified Van Assche index from baseline to long-term follow-up. No immediate adverse events related to bmMSC injections were observed. One patient was diagnosed with a local adenocarcinoma of the rectum 106 months after first bmMSC injection. MRI control 11 months prior showed complete fistula remission. The tumour exhibited a female karyotype, while bmMSC had been derived from a male volunteer.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In this analysis, 62% of complex perianal and 50% of rectovaginal fistulas showed long-term remission up to 8 years post-bmMSC therapy.

While subjective assessment may be prone to observer variability, a voxel-based quantification method can detect subtle signal intensity (SI) changes. This study aimed to compare the inter-rater reliability of subjective IPE evaluation with that of a voxel-based quantification method.MethodsPatients with stroke due to intracranial atherosclerosis were prospectively imaged using 7 T vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging. Two adjudicators independently assessed IPE, with discrepancies resolved by a third, experienced neuroradiologist. IPE distribution was quantified using a semiautomated method based on SI measurements from post-contrast T1-weighted images. The mean enhancement ratio was calculated for each plaque to assess gadolinium enhancement. Inter-rater reproducibility and the concordance between subjective and objective assessments were evaluated. Regression analysis was performed to identify plaque morphological features that influenced the reliability of subjective IPE adjudication compared to the objective method.ResultsWe analyzed 75 plaques from 41 patients. Inter-rater agreement for IPE adjudication was poor (κ = 0.34). Following consensus, 43% of plaques (32/75) were classified as enhancing, whereas 57% (43/75) were non-enhancing. The agreement between subjective and objective IPE assessments was moderate (κ = 0.40, p < 0.001). Subjective assessment was more likely to reliably adjudicate IPE for plaques exhibiting >50% stenosis (odds ratio (OR), 1.04; p = 0.02) and a positive remodeling index (OR, 2.20; p = 0.02). In contrast, it was less reliable when evaluating posterior circulation plaques (OR, 0.23; p = 0.01).ConclusionSubjective assessment of IPE demonstrated poor inter-rater agreement and only moderate concordance with voxel-based quantification following consensus.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThe aim of this study is to determine the interrater agreement in a clinical practice environment for the most commonly used magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) features of Crohn's disease (CD).\n\n\nMETHODS\nCD patients with MRE's before and after treatment were retrospectively identified using search queries over a 7-year period (May 2017-September 2017). MRE features of CD comprising components of multiple CD scoring indices were scored by radiologists in the same segment of bowel. Agreement for nominal categorical and continuous variables was assessed using a κ and interclass correlation coefficients, respectively.\n\n\nRESULTS\n80 scans comprised the study population. Moderate interrater agreement was seen in both the pre- and post-treatment MRE's for presence of diffusion restriction (к = 0.43, 0.48; pre- and post-treatment), stricturing disease (к = 0.51, 0.52), overall degree of severity (к = 0.49, 0.59). Substantial agreement was seen in pre- and post-treatment scans for length of involvement (interclass correlation coefficient = 0.67, 0.61). The presence of mucosal ulceration had no agreement (к = -0.07, -0.042).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMany MRE features of active CD comprising the major CD scoring indices are reproducible when interpreted by non-CD focused abdominal radiologists. However, the presence of mucosal ulcerations had no agreement and may need more investigation before including this feature as a driver in therapeutic decision making.\n\n\nADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE\nDemonstrates the unreliability of mucosal ulceration by non-CD focused abdominal radiologists, targeting a potential area for future education. Key Points The majority of MRE findings incorporated in to many CD scoring indices have fair to moderate inter-rater agreement even when read by non-MRE expert radiologists. Substantial agreement was seen in the length of involved bowel, but this feature is only incorporated in to one of the CD scoring indices. Presence of mucosal ulcerations had no interrater agreement in our study-a feature which is heavily weighted by several CD scoring indices. Research should be focused bridging those features which have poor interrater agreement.",

Eighteen radiation oncologists delineated GTV for 13 dogs with an imaging diagnosis of meningioma on pre- and postcontrast CT, pre- and postcontrast T1-weighted magnetic resonance, and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images.

      "abstract": "Back ground Perianal fistula is an abnormal communication between the anal canal and the outer perineal skin. It is a disease of young adults, being more common in males. MRI is a noninvasive, well-tolerated imaging modality with high resolution of the soft tissues. It is considered the imaging modality of choice for the initial evaluation and follow-up of perianal fistulas as it is more tolerated and less embarrassing for the patient than other imaging techniques. Objectives To compare MR sequences fat-suppressed (FS) T2-weighted imaging and Liver Acquisition with Volume Acceleration (LAVA) for better visualization and assessment of the perianal fistulas and sphincters. Patients and methods This was a retrospective study done in the period between January 2018 and January 2020 on 100 patients. The patients' age ranged from 15 to 67 years, with a mean age of 35.45 ± 12.35 years. All patients had previously undergone MRI pelvis with intravenous contrast. We considered the operative results as the reference standard. Results This study included 36 (36.0%) females and 64 (64.0%) males. LAVA sequence was better than T2 FS MRI sequence for the detection of the internal opening of the fistulous tract as well as secondary fistulous tracts with perfect interobserver agreement (P < 0.001). Both LAVA and T2 FS MRI sequences have the same significance for the detection of the abscesses, horseshoe, and supralevator extension of the fistula, with perfect interobserver agreement between both observers and between them and surgery. Conclusion Adding LAVA sequence to the protocol of MRI in the evaluation of perianal fistula helps to give better details as compared with T2 FS sequence as regarding the internal opening and the secondary tracts of the fistulous tract, but they have the same results regarding the sensitivity to detect abscesses, horseshoe, and supralevator extension of the perianal fistula.",

      "abstract": "Third and fourth branchial anomalies are rare lesions that account for 3–10% of all branchial lesions. They result from the failure of obliteration of the third and fourth branchial remnants and extend from the pyriform sinus to the thyroid gland because of the location of the orifice of drainage. A congenital pyriform sinus fistula (CPSF) may manifest as a cervical cystic mass with or without air on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In addition, some cases are accompanied by inflammatory changes in the adjacent tissue, thyroid gland, or mediastinum, which is shown to increase fat density, lymph node swelling, or abscess formation. The presence of air in the mass indirectly indicates communication with the air space to the mass, which results in a diagnosis of pyriform sinus fistula. The most important role of diagnostic imaging is to reveal the fistula. However, it is quite difficult to reveal it radiographically because the fistula can be seen when it contains exudate or abscess on noncontrast-enhanced images or when there is active inflammation on contrast-enhanced images that manifests as an enhanced fistula between the pyriform fossa and the upper pole of the thyroid gland or abscess. Although several studies have shown the usefulness of diagnostic imaging combinations of ultrasonography, CT, MRI, and barium esophagography to depict CPSF, there is still room for improvement regarding the diagnostic performance and problems of irradiation for pediatric cases. This challenge encourages the investigation in the field of MRI, which may potentially be a better modality to depict the presence of fistula itself, its inflammation, inflammatory extension to the adjacent tissue, and the presence of abscess, owing to the ability of soft-tissue resolution with MRI. There have been a few MRI reports on CPSF with a small number of patients and subjects and limited MR images; hence, the work by Han et al may provide answers in this field. In the article by Han et al published in this issue of JMRI, our understanding of CPSF is advanced by the findings of rare cases, including images obtained using 3T-MRI and numerous other findings with higher interobserver agreement, in a series of 115 subjects. They carefully obtained the MRI features of CPSF secondary to the third or fourth branchial pouch anomalies and performed interobserver agreement analysis of the features. The analysis revealed a significantly higher percentage of agreement. Han et al found tunnel-like lesions, the sinus tract passing through the thyroid gland, and the sinus tract beside the thyroid gland, which is a characteristic feature of CPSF in 7–40% of cases. They could diagnose CPSF in 87% of the cases using the MRI features, including the above findings and others that have extremely high diagnostic performance. The consensus of the findings in patients with CPSF and the opportunity to gain knowledge regarding the detection of tunnel-like lesions is a major additional benefit for the readers of JMRI. One limitation of the study is that the authors investigated the MRI appearance of patients with CPSF and concluded that MRI is a reliable method for the diagnosis of CPSF. However, no other modality was compared with MRI in this study; therefore, Han et al cannot directly say that MRI is a reliable method for diagnosis. The other limitation is that the pyriform sinus fistula, which is characteristic of CPSF, can be seen in 7–40% cases. This percentage is not high. However, the fistula should be considered when it contains abscess, exudate, or air mainly in T2-weighted images or if there is active inflammation in fat-saturated contrastenhanced T1-weighted images. If none of the above findings are noted, it is understandable that a fistula cannot be observed. The percentage that Han et al could obtain might be close to the percentage obtained in the actual clinical settings. Zhu et al reported that they could reveal pyriform fistula by barium esophagography in 39.5% of patients, which might be comparable with the Han et al result. On the other hand, Sheng et al reported that they could reveal pyriform fistula by barium esophagography in 100% cases after resolution of acute infection. Such a baseline adjustment might be the next step in obtaining a better diagnostic performance of MRI. The article by Han et al in this issue of JMRI is an excellent extension of the characteristic findings of CPSF obtained using MRI with or without contrast enhancement and should help radiologists in the interpretation and diagnosis of CPSF using MRI, especially in a 3T magnetic field. Radiologists should be aware of these findings and their importance in performing interpretations of MRI scans to show the presence of pyriform sinus fistula, activity of inflammation in the adjacent tissue, as",

      "abstract": "Background Dynamic changes in non-invasive tests, such as changes in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and MRI proton-density-fat-fraction (MRI-PDFF), may help to detect metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) resolution, but a combination of non-invasive tests may be more accurate than either alone. We developed a novel non-invasive score, the MASH Resolution Index, to detect the histological resolution of MASH. Methods This study included a derivation cohort of 95 well-characterised adult participants (67% female) with biopsy-confirmed MASH who underwent contemporaneous laboratory testing, MRI-PDFF and liver biopsy at two time points. The primary objective was to develop a non-invasive score to detect MASH resolution with no worsening of fibrosis. The most predictive logistic regression model was selected based on the highest area under the receiver operating curve (AUC), and the lowest Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion. The model was then externally validated in a distinct cohort of 163 participants with MASH from a clinical trial. Results The median (IQR) age and body mass index were 55 (45–62) years and 32.0 (30–37) kg/m2, respectively, in the derivation cohort. The most accurate model (MASH Resolution Index) included MRI-PDFF, ALT and aspartate aminotransferase. The index had an AUC of 0.81 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.93) for detecting MASH resolution in the derivation cohort. The score calibrated well and performed robustly in a distinct external validation cohort (AUC 0.83, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.91), and outperformed changes in ALT and MRI-PDFF. Conclusion The MASH Resolution Index may be a useful score to non-invasively identify MASH resolution.",

Promising data on short-term efficacy of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cell (bmMSC) treatment emerged in the recent past, but there is limited data regarding long-term efficacy and safety.\n \n \n \n Between February 2013 and January 2016, patients with non-active CD (Harvey-Bradshaw Index < 5) and draining complex, treatment-refractory perianal or rectovaginal fistulas underwent local bmMSC therapy as compassionate use. After curettage of the fistula tract, patients received three local bmMSC injections biweekly with 20 million cells each. In case of incomplete clinical and radiological healing 3 to 12 months after the first treatment, up to six additional injections with 40 million cells each were administrated, resulting in a maximal cumulative dose of 300 million bmMSC (table 1). We retrospectively analysed patient records for disease course and documentation of adverse events. Clinical remission was defined by closure of external fistula openings without discharge at digital pressure. The modified Van Assche index was assessed before bmMSC treatment as well as in short- and long-term MRI follow-up.\n \n \n \n Six female patients (median age 35 years, range 19 – 46 years) with two or three complex fistulas each were included. In total, 13 fistulas (9 transsphincteric, 2 extrasphincteric and 2 rectovaginal) underwent local bmMSC application (table 1). Median radiological and clinical follow up was 80 months (range, 44 – 98 months) after first local bmMSC injection. 8 of 13 fistulas (62%) exhibited complete closure at last observation. For rectovaginal fistulas, long-term remission was 50 % (1 of 2). Excluding rectovaginal fistulas, 4 of 6 patients (67%) showed long-term closure of all other fistulas. Pelvic MRI showed a decrease in modified Van Assche index from baseline (median score 7.8, range 6.2-9.7) to long-term follow up (median score 2.1, range 1.5-11.7). No immediate adverse events related to bmMSC injections were observed. One patient (p1) was diagnosed with a local adenocarcinoma of the rectum (pT1, pN0, R0) 106 months after first bmMSC injection. MRI control 11 months prior showed complete fistula remission. The tumor exhibited a female karyotype, while bmMSC had been derived from a male volunteer.\n \n \n \n More than 60% of all treatment-refractory CD perianal fistulas showed long-term remission up to 8 years after local allogenic bmMSC therapy.\n \n",

Quantitative MRI sequences (DWI, DCE, MT and T2) were used in a cohort of 25 pCD patients before and 12 weeks after biological therapy at two different field strengths (1.5 and 3 T). Disease activity was measured with the Perianal Crohn’s Disease Activity index (PDAI) and serum C-reactive protein (CRP). Diseased tissue areas on MRI were defined by a radiologist.

Here we present the preliminary results.\n \n \n \n 17 patients with pCD refractory to conventional-therapy > 6 months (medical and/or surgical, no patients with deviating stoma) were treated with 40 sessions of HBO therapy (243–253 kPa, 110 min per session throughout 8 weeks). Medical treatment remained stable from screening, seton drain(s) were removed after 30 treatment. Co-primary outcomes were clinical response as measured by the perianal disease activity index (PDAI) and MRI improvement measured by the modified van Assche index. Secondary outcomes were clinical response as assessed by fistula drainage assessment (FDA), biochemical response and patient-reported outcomes. All outcomes were assessed at baseline and 2 months after HBO.\n \n \n \n 17 patients (6 female, median age 34 years, median duration of disease 13 years) were treated. Median PDAI scores decreased from 8 to 4 (p < 0.001) and MRI scores from 9.4 to 7.3 (p = 0.001). Defined as PDAI of 4 or less, 11 out of 17 patients had inactive perianal disease after treatment, with 3 patients also having a predominantly fibrotic tract on MRI. Of the 45 external openings draining at baseline, 22 were clinically closed after treatment (49%, assessed by FDA). Four patients, three with one external opening and one with five openings at baseline, had no remaining openings after treatment. Median C-Reactive Protein and faecal calprotectin levels decreased from 5.0 and 416 to 2.3 and 31 (p = 0.002 and p = 0.003), respectively. Median scores of the inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) increased from 169 to 185 (p = 0.001) and VAS scores from the Euroqol-5-dimensions questionnaire increased from 65 to 75 (p = 0.07), higher scores reflecting better quality of life. When asked on a validated decision regret scale if patients regretted their decision to undergo HBO, the mean score was 12.5 (0–100, higher scores indicating higher regret). During follow-up, none of the patients needed new (experimental) medication, re-interventions or stoma. Seven out of 17 patients experienced trouble equalising middle ear pressure during HBO, with four patients showing signs of barotrauma after otoscopy. Three patients needed tympanostomy tubes. No other clinically relevant adverse events occurred, and no adverse events led to discontinuation of the treatment.\n \n \n \n Based on preliminary data, HBO treatment is associated with significant improvement in pCD, as measured by clinical and MRI endpoints.\n",

Patients with perianal fistulising Crohn's disease on maintenance infliximab or adalimumab, with drug levels within 6 months of perianal magnetic resonance imaging were included.

Radiologic disease activity was scored using the Van Assche Index, with an inflammatory subscore calculated using indices: T2-weighted imaging hyperintensity, collections >3 mm diameter, rectal wall involvement. Primary endpoint was radiologic healing (inflammatory subscore ≤6). Secondary endpoint was radiologic remission (inflammatory subscore = 0). Of 193 patients (infliximab, n = 117; adalimumab, n = 76), patients with radiologic healing had higher median drug levels compared with those with active disease (infliximab 6.0 vs 3.9 μg/mL; adalimumab 9.1 vs 6.2 μg/mL; both P < .05).

A single-centre cross-sectional analysis of patients with fistulizing perianal CD, who underwent pelvic MRI between January 2020 and December 2021, was performed. The clinical (age, sex, disease duration, disease location and behavior, disease activity [Perianal Disease Activity Index, PDAI] and treatment received) and radiological (number and location of fistulae, extensions, number and location of internal and external openings, fistula activity, presence or absence of perianal abscess and associated proctitis) characteristics of complex perianal fistula (defined according to the American Gastroenterological Association classification) were recorded. Of total 175 patients with CD who attended the gastroenterology clinic during the study period, 27 (15.42%) (mean age 42±15.5 years, 62.96% females and median disease duration four years) had complex perianal fistula and were included in the analysis. The mean PDAI was 5.48±2.53. The median Van Assche Index was 17 (interquartile range [IQR] 13-19). A majority (96.29%) of the fistulae were trans-sphincteric and four (14.81%) fistulae extended into the supralevator space. All fistulae were active on MRI. Concomitant perianal abscess and proctitis were seen in 59.26% (n=16) and 62.96% (n=17) of patients, respectively. Combination therapy with biologics and antibiotics/immune-suppressants were the most commonly prescribed medical therapy. Six (22.22%) patients underwent combined medical and surgical (non-cutting seton, fistulectomy, fecal diversion) treatment. The cumulative risk of the development of fistulizing perianal CD in a northern Indian cohort was similar to the western populations.

Regions of interests (ROI), including sternocleidomastoids (SCMs), trapezius (T), levator scapulae (LS), and scalenus muscles (S), were delineated manually and used for features extraction on IBEX. XGBoost, a machine learning algorithm, was used for the establishment of the prediction model. First, the patients were divided into training cohort (80%) and testing cohort (20%) randomly. Then the image features of CT or delta changes calculated from pre- and post-radiotherapy MRI images on each cohort constituted training and testing datasets. Then, based on the training dataset, a well-trained prediction model was produced. We used five-fold cross-validation to validate the predictive models. Afterward, the model performance was assessed on the ‘testing’ set and reported in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) under five scenarios: (I) only T1 sequence, (II) only T2 sequence, (III) only T1 post-contrast (T1 + C) sequence, (IV) Combination of all MRI sequences, (V) only CT. Results Most of the patients enrolled are male (73.1%), mean age was 47 years, receiving concurrent chemo-radiotherapy as the primary treatment (90.9%). By the end of the final follow-up, most of the patients were rated as mild fibrosis (60.8%). We found the prediction model based on the CT image features outperform all MRI features with an AUC of 0.69 and accuracy of 0.65. Contrarily, the model based on features from all MRI sequence showed lower AUC less than 0.5 and lower accuracy less than 0.6.

A centreline was placed through the terminal ileum (TI) lumen defining the diseased bowel length on the T2-weighted non-fat saturated sequence, used by two radiologists to independently segment the bowel wall to measure volume (phase 1). In phase 2, we measured disease volume in patients treated with biologics, who had undergone pre- and post-treatment MRE, with treatment response classified via global physician assessment.<h4>Results</h4>Phase 1 comprised 30 patients (median age 29 (IQR 24, 34) years). Phase 2 included 12 patients (25 years (22, 38)). In phase 1, the mean of the radiologist-measured volumes was used for analysis. The median disease volume in those with endoscopically active CD was 20.9 cm<sup>3</sup> (IQR 11.3, 44.0) compared to 5.7 cm<sup>3</sup> (2.9, 9.8) with normal endoscopy. The mean difference in disease volume between the radiologists was 3.0 cm<sup>3</sup> (limits of agreement -21.8, 15.9). The median disease volume of patients with active CD by sMARIA was 15.0 cm<sup>3</sup> (8.7, 44.0) compared to 2.85 cm<sup>3</sup> (2.6, 3.1) for those with inactive CD. Pre- and post-treatment median disease volumes were 28.5 cm<sup>3</sup> (26.4, 31.2), 11 cm<sup>3</sup> (4.8, 16.6), respectively in biological responders, vs 26.8 cm<sup>3</sup> (12.3, 48.7), 40.1 cm<sup>3</sup> (10, 56.7) in non-responders.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Volumetric measurement of terminal ileal CD by MRE is feasible, related to endoscopy and sMARIA activity, and responsive to biologics.<h4>Clinical relevance statement</h4>Measuring the whole volume of diseased bowel on MRE in CD is feasible, related to how biologically active the disease is when assessed by endoscopy and by existing MRE activity scores, and is sensitive to treatment response.<h4>Key points</h4>MRE reporting for CD is subjective and uses 2D images rather than assessing the full disease volume. Volumetric measurement of CD relates to endoscopic activity and shows reduced disease volumes in treatment responders. This technique is an objective biomarker that can assess disease activity and treatment response, warranting validation.",

We aimed to identify all scoring indices used in pIBD randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and to evaluate their operating properties.\n\n\nMETHODS\nMEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL were searched on December 6, 2022, to identify studies evaluating clinical, endoscopic, imaging, or patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in pIBD including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Validity, reliability, responsiveness, and feasibility were summarized.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSeventy RCTs evaluating pIBD indices were identified. Forty-one studies reported on the operating properties of 14 eligible indices (n = 9 CD, n = 5 UC). The Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) varied widely in terms of validity and reliability and was less feasible overall. In contrast, the Mucosal Inflammation Noninvasive Index, which includes fecal calprotectin, had better operating properties than the PCDAI. The Simplified Endoscopic Mucosal Assessment of Crohn's Disease appears more feasible and had similar operating properties than the longer Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease. The Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index was feasible, valid, and reliable, but responsiveness needs to be evaluated further. The Endoscopic Mayo score and the Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity were reliable, but validity and responsiveness need to be evaluated further. Imaging and PROMs/quality of life indices need further evaluation.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe operating properties of pIBD clinical trial end points varied widely. These results highlight the need for further validation and development of novel indices.",

Less is known about bone marrow-derived MSCs and little is known about predictive factors of response and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] evolution of the fistulae after MSC injection. Our aims were to evaluate the safety and clinical outcome of bone marrow-derived MSC injection for perianal fistulizing CD, to evaluate the MRI evolution of the fistulae and to identify factors associated with fistula closure. All CD patients with perianal fistula and appropriate drainage with a seton without abscess at MRI were eligible. Clinical examination, biomarkers and pelvic MRI were performed at weeks 0, 12 and 48. The clinical outcome was assessed by closure of the treated external openings at clinical examination and MRI exploration. Sixteen patients with a median age of 49 years and a median duration of perianal CD of 8 months were included. No unexpected safety event occurred. At weeks 12 and 48, 9/16 and 8/16 patients had complete fistula[e] closure, respectively, whereas 11/16 patients had at least partial closure. At MRI, the degree of fibrosis increased significantly after MSC injection. In total, 86% of patients with >80% of fibrosis of the fistula tract at week 48 had fistula closure. Fistula closure at week 12 was predictive of fistula closure at week 48. The MAGNIFI-CD did not change significantly over time. Open-label injection of bone marrow-derived MSCs was safe and was effective in half of the patients in fistulizing perianal CD and induced significant MRI changes associated with favourable clinical outcome.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease, the diagnostic efficacy of controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) was not very accurate in evaluating liver fat content. The aim of this study was to develop a score, based on CAP and conventional clinical parameters, to improve the diagnostic performance of CAP regarding liver fat content. METHODS: A total of 373 participants from 2 independent Chinese cohorts were included and divided into derivation (n = 191), internal validation (n = 75), and external validation (n = 107) cohorts. Based on the significant difference index between the 2 groups defined by the magnetic resonance imaging–proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) in derivation cohort, the optimal model (CAP-BMI-AST score [CBST]) was screened by the number of parameters and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). In the internal and external validation cohorts, the AUROC and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to compare the diagnostic performance of CBST with that of CAP. RESULTS: We constructed the CBST = −14.27962 + 0.05431 × CAP − 0.14266 × body mass index + 0.01715 × aspartate aminotransferase. When MRI-PDFF was ≥20%, ≥10%, and ≥5%, the AUROC for CBST was 0.77 (95% CI 0.70–0.83), 0.89 (95% CI 0.83–0.94), and 0.93 (95% CI 0.88–0.98), which was higher than that for CAP respectively. In the internal validation cohort, the AUROC for CBST was 0.80 (95% CI 0.70–0.90), 0.95 (95% CI 0.91–1.00), and 0.98 (95% CI 0.94–1.00). The optimal thresholds of CBST were −0.5345, −1.7404, and −1.9959 for detecting MRI-PDFF ≥20%, ≥10%, and ≥5%, respectively. DISCUSSION: The CBST score can accurately evaluate liver steatosis and is superior to the CAP.",

A restrospective analysis was performed on a total of 251 patients (training cohort, n = 119; internal validation cohort, n = 52; and external validation cohort, n = 80) with prostatic nodules who underwent biparametric MRI at two hospitals between January 2018 and December 2020. A total of 1130 radiomic features were extracted from each MRI sequence, including shape-based features, gray-level histogram-based features, texture features, and wavelet features. The clinical model was constructed using logistic regression analysis. Radiomic models were created by comparing seven machine learning classifiers. The useful clinical variables and radiomic signature were integrated to develop the combined model. Model performance was assessed by receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration curve, decision curve, and clinical impact curve. The ratio of free PSA to total PSA, PSA density, peripheral zone volume, and PI-RADS score were independent determinants of malignancy. The clinical model based on these factors achieved an AUC of 0.814 (95% CI: 0.763–0.865) and 0.791 (95% CI: 0.742–840) in the internal and external validation cohorts, respectively. The clinical-radiomic nomogram yielded the highest accuracy, with an AUC of 0.925 (95% CI: 0.894–0.956) and 0.872 (95% CI: 0.837–0.907) in the internal and external validation cohorts, respectively. DCA and CIC further confirmed the clinical usefulness of the nomogram. Biparametric MRI-based radiomics has the potential to noninvasively discriminate between—BPH and malignant PCa nodules, which outperforms screening strategies based on PSA and PI-RADS.",

Methods In a large cohort of patients diagnosed with PLS by expert opinion prior to the new criteria with detailed clinical baseline evaluation (n=107) and longitudinal follow-up (n=63), we applied the new diagnostic criteria and analysed the clinical phenotype, electromyography (EMG), diagnostic accuracy and prognosis, adding neurofilaments and MRI as potential biomarkers. Results The criteria for definite PLS were met by 28% and those for probable PLS by 19%, whereas 53% did not meet the full criteria at baseline, mainly due to the time, EMG and region criteria. Patients not meeting the criteria had less generalised upper motor neuron involvement but were otherwise similar in demographic and clinical characteristics. All patients with definite and probable PLS maintained PLS diagnosis during follow-up, while four patients not meeting the criteria developed clinical lower motor neuron involvement. Definite PLS cases showed improved survival compared with probable PLS and patients who did not meet the criteria. Despite a clinical PLS phenotype, fibrillation potentials/positive sharp waves and fasciculations in one or more muscles were a frequent EMG finding, with the extent and prognostic significance depending on disease duration. Serum neurofilament light and a multiparametric MRI fibre integrity Z-score correlated with clinical parameters and were identified as potential biomarkers.

      "abstract": "MRI is increasingly used in assessment with Crohn’s disease (CD)-related perianal fistulae (PAF) but reports of their utility in relation to assessing response to treatment is sparse. In the current issue, Azzam et al. [1] in a single-center retrospective study of the Saudi Inflammatory Bowel Disease Information System report the outcomes based on MRI healing at 12 months. This is the first study on CD-related PAF from the Middle East and adds to the literature around MRI healing rates in CD-PAF. In this study of 61 patients, they report a complete closure of the fistula tract on MRI in 44.4% of the patients treated with combination of anti-TNFs and immunomodulators after drainage of sepsis. This rate is higher than the previously reported rates in the literature. In a single-center study from London [2] of 26 PAF patients treated with anti-TNFs, the MRI closure of the fistula was achieved in 30% of patients at follow up of 18 months. A further study from the same center [3] reporting 3-year follow-up data suggested that the MRI healing lagged behind clinical closure by a median of 12 months. It is not clear from the study whether complete closure indicated disappearance of the fistula tract or simply the resolution of the inflammatory change with fibrosis of the tract. While MRI scoring systems have been developed in CD PAF, they are not used commonly in clinical settings as they have been found to be not responsive to change in fistula status [4]. Furthermore, the timing of MRI after treatment and its value in assessing response is not yet fully ascertained. There are some data to suggest that clinical healing may correlate with improvement in MRI scores and in particular T2 hyper intensity [5], although the MRI healing lag behind clinical improvement based on fistula drainage assessment by many months and even years [2]. Another result reported in this study is the identification of low BMI as a predictor for poor treatment response. The univariate analysis showed the previously well-recognized markers of poor response to treatment such as rectal involvement and presence of abscess [6] but on multivariate analysis only low BMI was predictor of lack of response. This is in contrast to evidence on existing studies of anti-TNFs in CD showing raised BMI associated with poor outcomes related to poor drug level concentrations [7]. The authors postulate this as reflection of disease severity but no details of the overall CD severity has been reported in the article. Treatment paradigms for PAF are still evolving and differences in modes of evaluating outcomes and differences in goals for treatment may have potential impact on the outcomes in studies evaluating therapies and lack of consistency in reporting outcomes is an important unmet need in perianal fistulizing CD [8]. In contrast to the concept of achieving mucosal healing using treat-to-target approaches in luminal CD, we are still grappling with the concept of understanding what is the realistic target in patients with perianal fistula? As such, does the principle of treat-to-target strategy for luminal CD could be applied on patients with perianal fistulizing disease? Do we have enough evidence that support targeting complete resolution of the fistula radiologically in addition to the clinical remission contribute to improving the patients’ outcomes? Do we have to react if the patients did not achieve complete healing of the fistula radiologically? These are still some of the unanswered questions, which need to be addressed in studies using clear outcome definitions. On this regard, the recently published Core Outcome Sets (COS) in perianal fistula [9] may be used as the guide to assess interventions in future studies on perianal fistula and this includes patient-reported measures as well as MRI incorporated in this.",

Although biological (anti-TNF) treatments are almost always used, long term fistula closure rates are far from being satisfactory. Radiological closure, which should be the treatment goal, is even much rarer. Stoma is one of the last steps in the treatment of resistant fistula. In our study, we examined the patients who underwent stoma, in our series, due to resistant PaF and the factors associated with radiological closure.\n \n \n \n Crohn's disease cohort was retrospectively evaluated for patients with resistant perianal fistula (history of poor response to anti-TNF) who underwent stoma. Demographic, treatment, and clinical characteristics of the patients were evaluated in terms of radiological closure (complete resolution of the fistula tract, disappearance of T2 hyperintensity and absence of contrast enhancement on MRI) of the PaF.\n \n \n \n There were 47 patients (11%) who underwent stoma due to perianal fistula among 423 Crohn's disease patients with PaF. The median age in the patient group (at the time of stoma) was 34 years and 47% of the patients were male. Radiological fistula closure was achieved in 42% of the patients and clinical remission (>3 months) was achieved in 66%. Table -1 summarizes the comparison of demographic, clinical and treatment parameters of the study group and patients with and without radiological closure. Radiologic closure and non-closure groups were similar regarding pre-stoma- and during stoma treatment status. Being a never smoker was associated with poor radiological closure and could be an indicator of treatment resistance while ex-smoker status had a favorable outcome. Both recurrent antibiotic treatment (>2/year) need for clinical fistula closure and history of seton replacement were associated with radiological unresponsiveness. During stoma, the early partial radiological response - achieved in the 3rd month of perianal MRI fistulography -was strongly associated with later radiological closure in the follow up. In Kaplan-Meir analysis; anatomically branching fistula had the poorest response, but the number of fistula did not have any influence, mucosal remission was associated with earlier and better radiological response, pre-stoma reccurent antibiotic need was associated with worse outcome Figure 1.\n \n \n \n Radiological closure of PaF can be achieved with stoma in nearly half of the patients under already combined conventional treatment.

      "abstract": "<h4>Background and aims</h4>Crohn's disease (CD) confers an increased risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but the pathogenesis remains poorly understood. We determined if active intestinal inflammation increases the risk of NAFLD in patients with CD.<h4>Methods</h4>Two cohorts (2017/2018 and 2020) with CD and no known liver disease were enrolled consecutively during staging magnetic resonance enterography. We quantified proton density fat fraction, MaRIA (Magnetic Resonance Index of Activity), and visceral adipose tissue. NAFLD was diagnosed when proton density fat fraction ≥5.5%. Synchronous endoscopy was graded by the Simple Endoscopic Score for CD and Rutgeerts score, while clinical activity was graded by the Harvey-Bradshaw index. Cytokine profiling was performed for the 2020 cohort. Transient elastography and liver biopsy were requested by standard of care.<h4>Results</h4>NAFLD was diagnosed in 40% (n = 144 of 363), with higher prevalence during radiographically quiescent disease (odds ratio, 1.7; P = .01), independent of body mass index/visceral adipose tissue (adjusted odds ratio, 7.8; P = .03). These findings were corroborated by endoscopic disease activity, but not by aggregate clinical symptoms. Circulating interleukin-8 was independent of body mass index to predict NAFLD, but traditional proinflammatory cytokines were not. NAFLD subjects had similar liver stiffness estimates regardless of CD activity. Definitive or borderline steatohepatitis was present in most patients that underwent liver biopsy.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Quiescent CD is associated with risk of NAFLD. These findings suggest potentially distinct pathogenic mechanisms of NAFLD in patients with CD compared with the prevailing leaky gut hypothesis proposed for individuals without inflammatory bowel disease.

This disease is characterized by recurrent bouts of intestinal inflammation with subsequent bowel wall damage, including scarring (i.e., fibrosis) and abnormal smooth muscle proliferation. MR enterography, an MRI examination tailored to assess the small bowel, is a first-line diagnostic tool for diagnosing CD in children, characterization and monitoring of disease severity and extent, and assessment of disease-related complications. To date, such MRI evaluations have been mostly qualitative, which can adversely impact diagnostic performance and inter-radiologist agreement. Quantitative MRI methods have been shown to aid in the evaluation of a variety of medical conditions and have been increasingly investigated in children and adults with CD. In CD, such objective techniques have been used to assist with diagnosis, assess treatment response, and characterize bowel wall histologic abnormalities.

However, the detection of changes indicative of axSpA requires specific expertise, which poses a challenge to non-specialized centers. Deep learning (an advanced machine learning method) based on training an artificial neural network may facilitate and support diagnostics in clinical practice.To create a reliable deep learning tool for the detection of active inflammatory and structural changes indicative of axSpA on MRI of sacroiliac joints.In this study, MRIs of sacroiliac joints from 477 patients from four cohorts (GESPIC-AS, GESPIC-Crohn, GESPIC-Uveitis and OptiRef comprising 266 patients with and 211 without axSpA) were used to develop a deep learning framework (randomly divided into training, n=404, and validation, n=73, datasets). MRIs from the ASAS cohort (n=116) were used for independent testing (test dataset). Each examination in the training/validation dataset was evaluated for the presence of active inflammatory and structural changes indicative of SpA by six experienced, trained and calibrated readers and by seven expert readers in the test dataset. The presence of the changes was defined as the majority vote amongst readers. Discordant cases in the training/validation dataset underwent consensus reading. In addition, the test dataset was evaluated by three radiologists not specifically trained in SpA. Diagnostic performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.The prevalence of positive imaging findings for active inflammatory/structural changes indicative of axSpA was 41%/51% in the training/validation dataset and 22%/22% in the test dataset. The model for the detection of active inflammatory changes showed an AUC of 0.91 (0.83 – 0.97) – Figure 1 – and an accuracy of 84% on the validation dataset; the corresponding sensitivity and specificity were 96% and 76%, respectively. Despite a substantially lower prevalence of active inflammatory changes in the test dataset, the model showed good generalization with an AUC of 0.91 (0.84−0.97) and an accuracy of 75%; the sensitivity and specificity were 88% and 71%, respectively. The model demonstrated a similar performance on the validation and test datasets for the detection of active inflammatory changes fulfilling the ASAS definition. The model for the detection of structural changes indicative of axSpA showed good performance on the validation dataset with an AUC of 0.90 (0.82-0.96) for the detection of structural changes and an overall accuracy of 85%. The associated sensitivity and specificity were 95% and 75%, respectively. The model showed reasonable generalization to new data with an AUC of 0.89 (0.81−0.96) and an accuracy of 79%; the sensitivity and specificity were 85% and 78%, respectively. Overall, the model performed close to the individual human experts - Figure 1.The developed framework allowed the detection of active inflammatory and structural changes indicative of axSpA on MRI.

      "abstract": "Purpose To develop a deep learning (DL) model that derives aligned strain values from cine (noncontrast) cardiac MRI and evaluate performance of these values to predict myocardial fibrosis in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Materials and Methods This retrospective study included 139 male patients with DMD who underwent cardiac MRI at a single center between February 2018 and April 2023. A DL pipeline was developed to detect five key frames throughout the cardiac cycle and respective dense deformation fields, allowing for phase-specific strain analysis across patients and from one key frame to the next. Effectiveness of these strain values in identifying abnormal deformations associated with fibrotic segments was evaluated in 57 patients (mean age [± SD], 15.2 years ± 3.1), and reproducibility was assessed in 82 patients by comparing the study method with existing feature-tracking and DL-based methods. Statistical analysis compared strain values using <i>t</i> tests, mixed models, and more than 2000 machine learning models; accuracy, F1 score, sensitivity, and specificity are reported. Results DL-based aligned strain identified five times more differences (29 vs five; <i>P</i> < .01) between fibrotic and nonfibrotic segments compared with traditional strain values and identified abnormal diastolic deformation patterns often missed with traditional methods. In addition, aligned strain values enhanced performance of predictive models for myocardial fibrosis detection, improving specificity by 40%, overall accuracy by 17%, and accuracy in patients with preserved ejection fraction by 61%. Conclusion The proposed aligned strain technique enables motion-based detection of myocardial dysfunction at noncontrast cardiac MRI, facilitating detailed interpatient strain analysis and allowing precise tracking of disease progression in DMD. <b>Keywords:</b> Pediatrics, Image Postprocessing, Heart, Cardiac, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy <i>Supplemental material is available for this article.</i> © RSNA, 2025.",

This study developed a CT and MRI radiomics-based model to predict conservative treatment failure risk.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 154 postmenopausal women with OVCF (2016-2024), divided into successful (n = 86) and failed (n = 68) conservative treatment groups. Three-dimensional regions of interest were delineated, and quantitative features extracted using PyRadiomics. Feature selection employed Mann-Whitney U test, Spearman correlation, and LASSO regression. Clinical, radiomics, and combined models were constructed using eight machine learning algorithms with 5-fold cross-validation.ResultsAge and vertebral CT Hounsfield units were significant clinical predictors. From 3668 initial features, 16 key radiomics features were selected. LightGBM performed best for clinical models, while k-nearest neighbors excelled for radiomics models. In testing, the clinical model achieved AUC 0.684 (accuracy 0.71), radiomics model AUC 0.812 (accuracy 0.71), and combined model AUC 0.859 (accuracy 0.806). The combined model significantly outperformed individual models.ConclusionThe comprehensive CT and MRI radiomics-based model accurately predicts conservative treatment failure risk in postmenopausal women with OVCF.

      "abstract": "Background High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is used for the treatment of symptomatic leiomyomas. We aim to automate uterine volumetry for tracking changes after therapy with a 3D deep learning approach. Methods A 3D nnU-Net model in the default setting and in a modified version including convolutional block attention modules (CBAMs) was developed on 3D T2-weighted MRI scans. Uterine segmentation was performed in 44 patients with routine pelvic MRI (standard group) and 56 patients with uterine fibroids undergoing ultrasound-guided HIFU therapy (HIFU group). Here, preHIFU scans ( n  = 56), postHIFU imaging maximum one day after HIFU ( n  = 54), and the last available follow-up examination ( n  = 53, days after HIFU: 420 ± 377) were included. The training was performed on 80% of the data with fivefold cross-validation. The remaining data were used as a hold-out test set. Ground truth was generated by a board-certified radiologist and a radiology resident. For the assessment of inter-reader agreement, all preHIFU examinations were segmented independently by both. Results High segmentation performance was already observed for the default 3D nnU-Net (mean Dice score = 0.95 ± 0.05) on the validation sets. Since the CBAM nnU-Net showed no significant benefit, the less complex default model was applied to the hold-out test set, which resulted in accurate uterus segmentation (Dice scores: standard group 0.92 ± 0.07; HIFU group 0.96 ± 0.02), which was comparable to the agreement between the two readers. Conclusions This study presents a method for automatic uterus segmentation which allows a fast and consistent assessment of uterine volume. Therefore, this method could be used in the clinical setting for objective assessment of therapeutic response to HIFU therapy. Deep learning methods enable accurate segmentation of the uterus in T2-weighted MRI. Automatic uterine volumetry is possible in patients with and without leiomyomas. Automated volumetry enables an objective assessment of response to high-intensity focused ultrasound therapy.",

      "abstract": "\n \n \n Perianal fistulas remain a debilitating and clinically challenging manifestation of Crohn’s disease (CD), given their prevalence and relative treatment resistance. Since the advent of biologic therapy, particularly the anti-TNFα agents infliximab and adalimumab, patient outcomes have improved. Serum trough levels have been associated with mucosal healing in luminal CD. However, the relationship between trough drug levels and healing of perianal fistulas remains less clear, with few studies assessing this cohort, and clinical healing typically defined as the primary endpoint. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between radiological healing of perianal fistulising Crohn’s Disease (pfCD) on MRI, and serum trough drug levels, in patients treated with anti-TNFα therapy.\n \n \n \n In this multi-centre, retrospective cross-sectional study, patients with pfCD who had trough levels measured within 6 months of a pelvic MRI were included. We collected patient demographics, infliximab and adalimumab trough levels, the presence or absence of anti-drug antibodies, concomitant steroid or antibiotic therapy, and Van Assche scores on MRI. The primary outcome, radiological response, was defined as a Van Assche score of 7 or less, while no response was defined as a score of greater than 7.\n \n \n \n A total of 99 patients were included (65 on infliximab, 34 on adalimumab). For patients receiving infliximab, the median drug levels for responders (n = 22) compared with non-responders (n = 43) were 5.5 mg/ml vs. 3.9 mg/ml respectively (p = 0.16). For patients receiving adalimumab, the median drug levels for responders (n = 14) compared with non-responders (n = 20) were 6.3 mg/ml vs. 3.1 mg/ml respectively (p = 0.09). On ROC curve analysis, the AUC for the association between radiological response and infliximab levels was 0.61, while for adalimumab it was 0.67. On quartile analysis, there appeared to be an increased response for increase in infliximab trough level quartile, with the exception of the highest quartile, however this association was not statistically significant (OR 1.36, 95% CI 0.85–2.16, p = 0.20). In comparison, the quartile analysis of adalimumab trough level and response demonstrated an exposure-response relationship (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.11–4.52, p = 0.02).\n \n \n \n Trough infliximab and adalimumab levels in patients who achieved radiological response were not significantly higher compared with those who did not, however quartiles analyses demonstrated trends toward an exposure-response relationship, in particular for adalimumab. The association between trough levels and radiological response could be further characterised with a larger, and ideally longitudinal, study.\n",

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered the reference standard, but endoanal ultrasound (EAUS) with high-frequency 360° probes provide a readily available, cost-effective, and repeatable alternative. <b>Methods</b>: We performed a narrative review of the literature, evaluating studies on the EAUS technique, diagnostic applications, distinguishing features of Crohn's-related fistulas, and comparative analyses with MRI. Consensus documents and structured reporting initiatives were also included. <b>Results</b>: EAUS provides high-resolution visualization of the anal sphincter complex and intersphincteric space, enabling the reliable detection of fistulas and abscesses. Characteristic features such as tract width > 4 mm, bifurcation, hyperechoic debris, the Crohn's Ultrasound Fistula Sign (CUFS), and the rosary sign assist in differentiating Crohn's from cryptoglandular fistulas. EAUS is well-suited for serial monitoring, perioperative seton guidance, and therapeutic decision-making. Emerging tools such as Doppler and shear wave elastography provide additional information on activity and fibrosis. MRI remains indispensable for supralevator disease, deep pelvic sepsis, and standardized activity indices. Comparative studies indicate similar sensitivity for simple fistulas, with MRI superior in complex cases; combining both modalities maximizes accuracy. <b>Conclusions</b>: EAUS is a practical and repeatable imaging tool that complements MRI in the multidisciplinary management of perianal Crohn's disease. Advances such as 3D imaging, contrast enhancement, and elastography may enable validated activity scoring-for example, a future PEACE (Perianal Endosonographic Activity in Chron's Evaluation) Index-further strengthening its role in longitudinal care.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background: Due to the high soft tissue resolution, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could improve the accuracy of pancreatic tumor delineation in radiation treatment planning. A multi-institutional study was proposed to evaluate the impact of MRI on inter-observer agreement in gross tumor volume (GTV) and duodenum delineation for pancreatic cancer compared with computer tomography (CT). Material and Methods: Two clinical cases of borderline resectable (Case 1) and unresectable (Case 2) pancreatic cancer were selected. In two sequential steps, diagnostic contrast-enhanced CT scan and MRI sequences were sent to the participating centers. CT-GTVs were contoured while blinded to MRI data sets. DICE index was used to evaluate the spatial overlap accuracy. Results: Thirty-one radiation oncologists from different Institutions submitted the delineated volumes. CT- and MRI-GTV mean volumes were 21.6 ± 9.0 cm3 and 17.2 ± 6.0 cm3, respectively for Case 1, and 31.3 ± 15.6 cm3 and 33.2 ± 20.2 cm3, respectively for Case 2. Resulting MRI-GTV mean volume was significantly smaller than CT–GTV in the borderline resectable case (p < .05). A substantial agreement was shown by the median DICE index for CT– and MRI–GTV resulting as 0.74 (IQR: 0.67–0.75) and 0.61 (IQR: 0.57–0.67) for Case 1; a moderate agreement was instead reported for Case 2: 0.59 (IQR:0.52–0.66) and 0.53 (IQR:0.42–0.62) for CT– and MRI–GTV, respectively. Conclusion: Diagnostic MRI resulted in smaller GTV in borderline resectable case with a substantial agreement between observers, and was comparable to CT scan in interobserver variability, in both cases. The greater variability in the unresectable case underlines the critical issues related to the outlining when vascular structures are more involved. The integration of MRI with contrast-enhancement CT, thanks to its high definition of tumor relationship with neighboring vessels, could offer a greater accuracy of target delineation.",

Recent studies have shown the relevance of MRI in detailing the pelvic anatomy, particularly small Mullerian remnants. The results are, however, not consistent and reproducibility of MRI features has not been confirmed. The aim of our study was to evaluate the detailed pelvic anatomy in patients with MRKH syndrome and to calculate the interobserver agreement of the MRI features.\n               \n               \n                  Methods:\n                  The study was carried out on female patients, aged 15–30 years, with primary amenorrhea. Following clinical, gynaecological, endocrinological, ultrasound and chromosomal work-up and a provisional diagnosis of MRKH syndrome, MRI pelvis was performed on 25 patients using a 1.5 T scanner.

This study evaluated the feasibility of intestinal ultrasound (IUS) for semiquantitative analysis of CF and compared the agreement between IUS and computed tomography enterography (CTE).<h4>Methods</h4>In this retrospective study, we recruited consecutive CD patients who underwent IUS and CTE. CF wrapping angle was analyzed on the most affected bowel segment and was independently evaluated by IUS and CTE. We evaluated the wrapping angle of CF in the cross- and vertical sections of the diseased bowel. CF wrapping angle was divided into < 180° and ≥ 180°. IUS performance was assessed using CTE as a reference standard, and IUS interobserver consistency was evaluated.<h4>Results</h4>We enrolled 96 patients. CTE showed that CF wrapping angle was < 180° in 35 patients and ≥ 180° in 61 patients. We excluded three cases in which the observation positions were inconsistent between the IUS and CTE. Excellent agreement was shown between US and CTE (82/93, 88.2%). The eleven remaining cases showed inconsistencies mostly in the terminal ileum (n = 5) and small intestine (n = 4). Total agreement between IUS observers was 89.6% (86/96, κ = 0.839, p = 0.000), with perfect agreement for the ileocecal and colonic segments (35/37, 94.6% and 20/21, 95.2%, respectively) and moderate agreement for small intestinal segments (16/21, 76.2%).<h4>Conclusions</h4>IUS could be of value and complementary to CTE for assessing CF, particularly in patients with affected terminal ileum and colon. IUS is a non-invasive technique for monitoring CD patients.<h4>Critical relevance statement</h4>In our study, excellent agreement was shown between intestinal US observers as well as between US and CT enterography (CTE) for assessing creeping fat (CF), which showed that ultrasound could be of value and complementary to CTE.<h4>Key points</h4>Creeping fat (CF) is a potential therapeutic target in Crohn's disease.

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Lower gastrointestinal symptoms attributed to colorectal disease are common. Early diagnosis of serious colorectal disease such as colorectal cancer (CRC), precancerous growths (polyps) and inflammation is important to ensure the best possible outcomes for a patient. The current 'gold standard' diagnostic test is colonoscopy. Colonoscopy is an invasive procedure. Some people struggle to cope with it and require intravenous sedation and/or analgesia. It is also resource-intensive, needing to be performed in specialist endoscopy units by a trained team. Across the UK, the demand for colonoscopy is outstripping capacity and the diagnosis of colorectal disease is being delayed. A colon capsule endoscope (CCE) is an alternative colorectal diagnostic. It is a 'camera in a pill' that can be swallowed and which passes through the gastrointestinal tract, obtaining visual images on the colon. There is now established experience of CCE in the UK. CCE might provide a less invasive method to diagnose colorectal disease if found to be accurate and effective and provide a means by which to increase the National Health Service (NHS) diagnostic capacity.<h4>Aims and objectives</h4>The aim of this study is to determine the diagnostic accuracy of CCE when compared with colonoscopy in representative and clinically meaningful cohorts of patients. An evaluation of the experiences of CCE for the patient and clinical team and an assessment of cost effectiveness will be undertaken.<h4>Methods</h4>We will undertake three research workstreams (WS). In WS1, we shall perform a paired (back-to-back) study. Each participant will swallow the CCE and then later on the same day they will have a colonoscopy. The study has been designed in collaboration with our Patient Advisory Group and as closely mirrors standard care as is possible. 973 participants will be recruited from three representative clinical contexts; suspected CRC, suspected inflammatory bowel disease and postpolypectomy surveillance. Up to 30 sites across the UK will be involved to maximise inclusivity. Measures of diagnostic accuracy will be reported along with CCE completion rates, number of colonoscopy procedures potentially prevented and adverse events, such as capsule retention. A nested substudy of intraobserver and interobserver agreement will be performed. WS2 will develop models of cost-effectiveness and WS3 will evaluate the patient and clinician experience, with reference to acceptability and choice.<h4>Anticipated impact</h4>The study findings will provide the evidence base to inform future colorectal diagnostic services.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>The study has approval from the North East-Tyne and Wear South research ethics committee (REC reference 24/NE/0178, IRAS 331349). The findings will be disseminated to the NHS, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, other clinical stakeholders and participants, patients and the public.<h4>Trial registration number</h4>ISRCTN16126290.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Characterised by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) symptoms including diarrhoea, abdominal pain and fatigue can significantly impact patient’s quality of life. Therapeutic developments in the last 20 years have revolutionised treatment. However, clinical trials and real-world data show primary non-response rates up to 40%. A significant challenge is an inability to predict which treatment will benefit individual patients. Current understanding of IBD pathogenesis implicates complex interactions between host genetics and the gut microbiome. Most cohorts studying the gut microbiota to date have been underpowered, examined single treatments and produced heterogeneous results. Lack of cross-treatment comparisons and well-powered independent replication cohorts hampers the ability to infer real-world utility of predictive signatures. IBD-RESPONSE will use multi-omic data to create a predictive tool for treatment response. Future patient benefit may include development of biomarker-based treatment stratification or manipulation of intestinal microbial targets. IBD-RESPONSE and downstream studies have the potential to improve quality of life, reduce patient risk and reduce expenditure on ineffective treatments. Methods and analysis This prospective, multicentre, observational study will identify and validate a predictive model for response to advanced IBD therapies, incorporating gut microbiome, metabolome, single-cell transcriptome, human genome, dietary and clinical data. 1325 participants commencing advanced therapies will be recruited from ~40 UK sites. Data will be collected at baseline, week 14 and week 54. The primary outcome is week 14 clinical response. Secondary outcomes include clinical remission, loss of response in week 14 responders, corticosteroid-free response/remission, time to treatment escalation and change in patient-reported outcome measures. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was obtained from the Wales Research Ethics Committee 5 (ref: 21/WA/0228). Recruitment is ongoing. Following study completion, results will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific meetings. Publications will be summarised at www.ibd-response.co.uk.

      "abstract": "Aims Cardiac decompensation (CD) in patients with aortic stenosis is a “red flag” for future adverse events. We classified patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) into those with acute, prior, or no prior CD at the timepoint of TAVI and compared their clinical presentation, prognosis, and effects of the prescribed medication during follow-up. Methods Retrospective analysis of patients of one center fulfilling the criteria of 30-day device success after transfemoral TAVI. Results From those patients with no CD (n = 1,985) ranging to those with prior CD (n = 497) and to those with acute CD (n = 87), we observed a stepwise increase in the proportion of patients in poor clinical condition, NYHA class III/IV, low psoas muscle area, fluid overload (rales, oedema, pleural effusion), reduced ejection fraction, renal insufficiency, and anemia. More diuretics but less renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (ACEI/ARB) were prescribed for patients with acute CD compared to other groups. Prior CD (hazard ratio and 95% CI 1.40; 1.02–1.91) and acute CD (1.72; 1.01–2.91), a reduced general condition (1.53; 1.06–2.20), fluid overload (1.54;1.14–2.08), atrial fibrillation (1.76; 1.32–2.33), and anemia (1.43;1.08–1.89) emerged as strong independent predictors of one-year mortality. In all three classes of CD, prescribing of ACEI/ARB was associated with a substantial improvement of survival. Conclusions The clinical presentation of (acute or prior) cardiac decompensation in patients with AS overlapped substantially with that of patients with classical signs of heart failure. Our results may support an early treatment strategy in patients with left ventricular dysfuntion before clinical signs of congestion are manifest. Moreover, these patients require intensive medical attention after TAVI.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Purpose</h4>This study constructs a predictive model for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) refractoriness using a machine learning (ML) algorithm and verifies the predictive performance of different algorithms.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of 131 patients (48 with TACE refractoriness) who underwent repeated TACE treatment for HCC were retrospectively collected. The training and validation cohorts comprised 104 and 27 cases, respectively, following an 8:2 ratio. Clinical imaging characteristics related to TACE refractoriness were identified through logistic regression analysis. HCC lesions on arterial phase, portal phase, delayed phase, and T2-weighted fat suppression MRI images before the first TACE were manually delineated as regions of interest. Dimension reduction was conducted using variance threshold, univariate selection, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator methods. Relevant indices of TACE refractoriness were selected. ML algorithms, including a support vector machine, random forest, logistic regression and adaptive boosting, were used to construct the radiomics, clinical prediction, and combined models. The predictive performance of these models was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves. The optimal model was presented as a nomogram and verified through calibration and decision curve analyses.<h4>Results</h4>In evaluating radiomics models for predicting TACE refractoriness in HCC, the LR-developed portal venous phase (VP) model achieved optimal single-sequence performance (training AUC: 0.896, 95% CI: 0.843-0.941; validation: 0.853, 0.727-0.965). Multisequence models significantly surpassed single-sequence counterparts, with the T2WI-FS+AP+VP+DP multisequence LR model demonstrating peak efficacy (training: 0.905, 0.853-0.949; validation: 0.876, 0.773-0.976). The integrated clinical-radiomics model demonstrated robust predictive performance, achieving a training cohort AUC of 0.955 (95% CI: 0.918-0.984) with 0.885 accuracy, 0.921 sensitivity, and 0.864 specificity, and maintained strong validation performance (AUC=0.941, 95% CI: 0.880-0.991).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Multisequence clinical-radiomics model accurately predicts TACE refractoriness in hepatocellular carcinoma.",

      "pmid": "35210804",
      "abstract": "Background Anal fistulas cause great uncertainty and anxiety in patients and surgeons alike. This is largely because of the inability to accurately confirm postoperative fistula healing, especially long-term healing. There is no scoring system available that can objectively assess cryptoglandular anal fistulas for postoperative healing and can also accurately predict long-term healing. Methods Several parameters that could indicate anal fistula healing were assessed. Out of these, six parameters (four MRI-based and two clinical) were finalized, and a weighted score was given to each parameter. A novel scoring system (NSS) was developed. A minimum possible score (zero) indicated complete healing whereas the maximum weighted score (n = 20) indicated confirmed non-healing. Scoring was done with postoperative MRI (at least 3 months post-surgery), then compared with the actual healing status, and subsequently correlated with the final long-term clinical outcome. Results The NSS was validated in 183 operated cryptoglandular fistula-in-ano patients over a 3-year period in whom 283 MRIs (preoperative plus postoperative) were performed. The postoperative follow-up was 12–48 months (median-30 months). The NSS was found to have a very high positive predictive value (98.2%) and moderately high negative predictive value (83.7%) for long-term fistula healing. Additionally, its sensitivity and specificity in predicting healing were 93.9% and 94.7%, respectively. Conclusion Thus, this new scoring system is highly accurate and would be a useful tool for surgeons and radiologists managing anal fistulas. By objectivizing the assessment of postoperative healing, it can both ease and streamline management. Moreover, reliable prediction of recurrence-free long-term healing will greatly allay the apprehensions associated with this dreaded disease.",

The fistula characteristics obtained from these examinations were compared with the surgical findings. The comparative results were evaluated by means of the Kappa analysis method. CT fistulography predicted the correct perianal fistula classification in 30 (73.1%) of the 41 patients, whereas MRI correctly defined fistula classification in 38 (92.7%) of these patients (the K values were 0.621 and 0.896, respectively; with p < 0.001).

In terms of locations of internal openings, CT fistulography was able to detect the locations in 28 patients (68.2%), whereas MRI was more successful in this aspect, with a number of 35 patients (85.3%). Granulation tissues, inflammation and edema around the fistula, abscesses, and fistular wall fibrosis were also evaluated.

Differential analysis comparing responders (R) with perianal fistula closure at W48 (n=5) with non-responders (NR), with absence of closure at any visit including W48, (n=5), identified specific proteomic profile changes, which were also evaluated by Gene Ontology analyses to identify biological processes, cell types and pathways associated with fistula closure.\n \n \n \n total of 1883 proteins were identified and the differential analysis revealed 48 proteins differentially distributed in R versus NR profiles. Only 18 were more abundant in R, among which the product of the STK4, PLP2, CYB5B and FLG genes, showing the strongest significant increases in R and therefore potential associations with fistula closure after bmMSCs injections. The fistula tract material of patients showing no closure (NR) reveal higher number of proteins, together with NR>R relative abundances, associated with inflammatory and immune infiltrates, with chemokines, bacterial invasion. NR profiles show as well lower numbers and relative levels of proteins involved in wound healing and in matrix remodeling than in R (figures 1 and 2). Among the proteins, differentially distributed in R versus NR, specific pro-apoptotic (R>NR) and anti-apoptotic proteins (NR>R) could be highlighted, in addition to specific proteins acting upstream pathways involved in morphogenesis, carcinogenesis and fibrosis (HIPPO, MAPK, JAK-STAT pathways and TGF signaling).\n \n \n \n Our data provide the first descriptive picture of proteins and likely process/pathways associated with fistula closure after bmMSCs treatment.

Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and T2-weighted imaging are emerging techniques that can obviate the need for contrast injection in cases where contrast administration is not feasible or contraindicated. The main objective of our study was to compare the efficacy of the combination of DWI and T2 STIR (short tau inversion recovery) imaging with contrast-enhanced MRI for the diagnosis and characterization of perianal fistula. Methods: Sixty-nine patients with clinical perianal fistula with at least one external opening were evaluated with DWI, T2 STIR, and contrast MRI. A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted in the Department of Radiodiagnosis and Imaging, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhopal, India. The chi-square test was done to find the association between categorical variables. The Kappa test was done to estimate the agreement between two different tests in measuring the outcome. The validity of tests was measured using sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy. Results: The combination of DWI and T2 STIR is equivalent to contrast-enhanced MRI in the evaluation of primary and complicated perianal fistula. The combination of DWI and T2 STIR is superior to DWI alone in the classification and characterization of perianal fistula. However, DWI is superior to T2 STIR in differentiating perianal inflammation with abscess from perianal inflammation without abscess and can be used as an alternative to post-contrast fat-suppressed T1-WI in the detection of perianal abscesses and disease activity. Conclusion: DWI can be used as an adjunct to T2 STIR, and the combination of DWI and T2 STIR can replace the post-contrast fat-suppressed T1 MRI sequence in the classification and characterization of perianal fistula.",

LV scar evolves over time and needs longitudinal assessment. Currently, LV scar detection relies on late gadolinium enhancement MRI, which is limited by high cost and artifacts from implanted cardiac devices. To address this, we developed XplainScar, an explainable machine learning model that identifies LV scar using 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) data. XplainScar was trained and validated on retrospective data from 748 HCM patients across two centers (500 from Johns Hopkins hospital for model development, and 248 from UCSF for validation). XplainScar employs a combination of unsupervised and self-supervised representation learning to effectively predict scar presence, and discover ECG features associated with LV scar. XplainScar rapidly analyzes ECG data (< 1 min for 10 patients) and demonstrates strong predictive performance on the held-out test set, achieving an F1-score of 89%, sensitivity of 90%, specificity of 78%, and precision of 88%. By providing an effective, cost-effective, and transparent alternative to MRI, XplainScar has the potential to assist with patient care, and reduce healthcare costs related to LV scar monitoring in HCM.

      "abstract": "Objectives Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), a therapy that uses radiation to treat brain tumors, has become a significant treatment procedure for patients with brain metastasis (BM). However, a proportion of patients have been found to be at risk of local failure (LF) after treatment. Hence, accurately identifying patients with LF risk after SRS treatment is critical to the development of successful treatment plans and the prognoses of patients. To accurately predict BM patients with the occurrence of LF after SRS therapy, we develop and validate a machine learning (ML) model based on pre-treatment multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiomics and clinical risk factors. Patients and methods In this study, 337 BM patients were included (247, 60, and 30 in the training set, internal validation set, and external validation set, respectively). Four clinical features and 223 radiomics features were selected using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and Max-Relevance and Min-Redundancy (mRMR) filters. We establish the ML model using the selected features and the support vector machine (SVM) classifier to predict the treatment response of BM patients to SRS therapy. Results In the training set, the SVM classifier that uses a combination of clinical and radiomics features demonstrates outstanding discriminative performance (AUC=0.95, 95% CI: 0.93-0.97). Moreover, this model also achieves satisfactory results in the validation sets (AUC=0.95 in the internal validation set and AUC=0.93 in the external validation set), demonstrating excellent generalizability. Conclusions This ML model enables a non-invasive prediction of the treatment response of BM patients receiving SRS therapy, which can in turn assist neurologist and radiation oncologists in the development of more precise and individualized treatment plans for BM patients.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Introduction</h4>Perianal fistulising Crohn's disease (pfCD) can be somewhat treatment refractory. Higher infliximab trough levels (TLIs) may improve fistula healing rates; however, it remains unclear whether escalating infliximab therapy to meet higher TLI targets using proactive, or routine, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) improves outcomes. This randomised controlled trial aimed to assess whether infliximab therapy targeting higher TLIs guided by proactive TDM improves outcomes compared with standard therapy.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>Patients with active pfCD will be randomised 1:1 to either the proactive TDM arm or standard dosing arm and followed up for 54 weeks. Patients in the proactive TDM arm will have infliximab dosing optimised to target higher TLIs. The targets will be TLI ≥ 25 µg/mL at week 2, ≥ 20 µg/mL at week 6 and ≥ 10 µg/mL during maintenance therapy. The primary objective will be fistula healing at week 32. Secondary objectives will include fistula healing, fistula closure, radiological fistula healing, patient-reported outcomes and economic costs up to 54 weeks. Patients in the standard dosing arm will receive conventional infliximab dosing not guided by TLIs (5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2 and 6, and 5 mg/kg 8 weekly thereafter). Patients aged 18-80 years with pfCD with single or multiple externally draining complex perianal fistulas who are relatively naïve to infliximab treatment will be included. Patients with diverting ileostomies or colostomies and pregnant or breast feeding will be excluded. Fifty-eight patients per arm will be required to detect a 25% difference in the primary outcome measure, with 138 patients needed to account for an estimated 6.1% primary non-response rate and 10% dropout rate.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>Results will be presented in peer-reviewed journals and international conferences. Ethics approval has been granted by the South Western Sydney Local Health District Human Research Ethics Committee in Australia.<h4>Trial registration number</h4>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12621000023853); Pre-results.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Purpose</h4>Complex anal fistulas can recur after clinical healing, even after a long interval which leads to significant anxiety. Also, ascertaining the efficacy of any new treatment procedure becomes difficult and takes several years. We prospectively analyzed the validity of Garg scoring system (GSS) to predict long-term fistula healing.<h4>Methods</h4>In patients operated for cryptoglandular anal fistulas, magnetic resonance imaging was performed preoperatively and at 3 months postoperatively to assess fistula healing. Scores as per the GSS were calculated for each patient at 3 months postoperatively and correlated with long-term healing to check the accuracy of the scoring system.<h4>Results</h4>Fifty-seven patients were enrolled, but 50 were finally included (7 were excluded). These 50 patients (age, 41.2±12.4 years; 46 men) were followed up for 12 to 20 months (median, 17 months). Forty-seven patients (94.0%) had complex fistulas, 28 (56.0%) had recurrent fistulas, 48 (96.0%) had multiple tracts, 20 (40.0%) had horseshoe tracts, 15 (32.0%) had associated abscesses, 5 (10.0%) were suprasphincteric, and 8 (16.0%) were supralevator fistulas. The GSS could accurately predict long-term healing (high positive predictive value, 31 of 31 [100%]) but was not very accurate in predicting nonhealing (negative predictive value, 15 of 19 [78.9%]). The sensitivity in predicting healing was 31 of 35 (88.6%).<h4>Conclusion</h4>GSS accurately predicts long-term fistula with a high positive predictive value (100%) but is less accurate in predicting nonhealing. This scoring system can help allay anxiety in patients and facilitate the early validation of innovative procedures for anal fistulas.",

Perianal fistula can be the first manifestation of CD, and needs to be differentiated from non-CD associated perianal fistula. This study sought to identify the variations in MRI characteristics of perianal fistulas in patients with and without inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), considering the potential implications for treatment decisions.\n \n \n \n This was a single-center cross-sectional analysis of patients who underwent pelvic MRI for assessment of perianal fistula between January 2021 and June 2022 at Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMCH), Ludhiana, India. Patients who underwent dedicated MRI fistula protocol were included. Patients with prior anal resection or anastomosis, anorectal tumor, or equivocal imaging findings that could not be definitely assessed as a fistula were excluded. The following features were assessed: anatomic type of fistula (Parks classification), luminal origin (hour clock position), anal verge distance, signs of acute inflammation, circumference of anus involved by inflammation, presence of rectal inflammation, and abscess.\n \n \n \n Between January 2022 and December 2022, a total of 287 MRI scans were conducted to assess for perianal fistulae. Out of these, 119 MRI scans met the eligibility criteria and 32(26.89%) were associated with an established clinical diagnosis of CD. A higher proportion of females had CD-associated perianal fistula compared to non-CD perianal fistula. A significantly greater percentage of CD-associated perianal fistulas exhibited supra-levator extension, multiple and branched fistula tracts, and ≥2 internal and external openings. Patients with CD had higher prevalence of concurrent perianal abscess, proctitis, anorectal strictures, and a greater number of clock hours of inflamed anal circumference, compared to patients with cryptoglandular fistula. (Table 1) On multivariate logistic regression analysis, female sex, ≥2 internal openings, proctitis and height of the mucosal origin of the fistula from the anal verge >1.85 cm independently predicted the perianal fistula to be associated with CD. We constructed the DMCH index as follows:\n DMCH index: (3xfemale sex) + (3x≥2 internal openings of the fistula tract) + (6xrectal wall thickening) + (2xheight of mucosal origin of the fistula from anal verge >1.85 cm)\n The DMCH index greater than 7 identified the perianal fistulae associated with CD with a sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 91% [Area under curve 0.91; 95% CI 0.85-0.97; P< 0.0001].(Figure 1)\n \n \n \n The DMCH index identifies CD associates perianal fistula with a high level of accuracy.

There is dearth of literature on safety and efficacy of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) in this population. An open-label, phase I/II, single-arm study was conducted involving local administration of human allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells in perianal fistula of patients with Crohn’s disease refractory to standard therapies. Clinical severity and biomarkers were assessed at baseline and periodically until week 104 , and MRI at week 24 and 104. Primary and secondary objectives were to assess safety and efficacy respectively. Fistula remission was complete closure of fistula openings with < 2 cm perianal collection on MRI, and fistula response was decrease in drainage by ≥ 50%. Change in perianal disease activity index, quality-of-life and Van Assche index on MRI over time was assessed using mixed-effect linear regression model. Ten patients (male:8, mean age:27.4 ± 12.0years) were recruited. Self-resolving procedure-related adverse events occurred in three patients, with no follow-up adverse events. In intention to treat analysis at week 24, two patients (20%) achieved fistula remission and seven (70%) had fistula response. At week 52, two (20%) patients were in remission and seven (70%) maintained response. At 104 weeks, two (20%) patients maintained response and one (10%) was in remission. Statistically significant decrease in perianal disease activity index (P = 0.008), Van Assche Index (P = 0.008) and improvement in quality-of-life (P = 0.001) were observed over time.

      "abstract": "Breast density, which is the ratio between fibroglandular tissue (FGT) and total breast volume, can be assessed qualitatively by radiologists and quantitatively by computer algorithms. These algorithms often rely on segmentation of breast and FGT volume. In this study, we propose a method to directly assess breast density on MRI, and provide interpretations of these assessments.   We assessed breast density in 506 patients with breast cancer using a regression convolutional neural network (CNN). The input for the CNN were slices of breast MRI of 128 x 128 voxels, and the output was a continuous density value between 0 (fatty breast) and 1 (dense breast). We used 350 patients to train the CNN, 75 for validation, and 81 for independent testing. We investigated why the CNN came to its predicted density using Deep SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP).   The density predicted by the CNN on the testing set was significantly correlated with the ground truth densities (N = 81 patients, Spearman's rho = 0.86, P < 0.001). When inspecting what the CNN based its predictions on, we found that voxels in FGT commonly had positive SHAP-values, voxels in fatty tissue commonly had negative SHAP-values, and voxels in non-breast tissue commonly had SHAP-values near zero. This means that the prediction of density is based on the structures we expect it to be based on, namely FGT and fatty tissue.   To conclude, we presented an interpretable deep learning regression method for breast density estimation on MRI with promising results.",

Integrating patient-reported outcomes (PROs) into clinical practice is crucial for comprehensive disease management. Objective To evaluate the responsiveness and clinical utility of Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) instruments, compared with standard clinical assessment tools in pediatric CD patients. Methods A longitudinal, prospective study with 31 pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) patients aged 8–17 years recruited from a Pediatric Gastroenterology Unit. Data were collected at baseline and every 6 months over 18 months. PROMIS pediatric measures assessed PROs. Disease activity was evaluated using the pediatric Crohn's disease activity index (PCDAI) and clinical markers. IMPACT-III was also applied. Linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) and bivariate analyses were used to assess changes over time. Results PROMIS Global Health scores showed significant improvement over time, indicating enhanced overall health perceptions among patients. Notable reductions were observed in PROMIS Pain Interference and Fatigue scores, indicating better physical health. PROMIS depression scores generally decreased, suggesting improved mental health. PCDAI scores, hemoglobin, and platelet count significantly changed and correlated with PROMIS measures. Globally, the study demonstrated significant and clinically relevant changes in multiple PROMIS measures, confirming their responsiveness to changes in disease activity. Conclusion PROMIS instruments are clinically useful in managing pediatric CD, providing valuable insights into global health and quality of life.

We retrospectively identified patients registered in the Saudi Inflammatory Bowel Disease Information System registry, who were diagnosed as PFCD based on MRI and treated with infliximab or adalimumab.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a nitinol proctology clip for closure of complex anocutaneous fistulas.

Data were obtained from patient records and MRI reports, as well as follow-up telephone calls and clinical follow-up with endoanal ultrasonography. All of the patients were treated for high transsphincteric and suprasphincteric anocutaneous fistulas at the Digestive Disease Center, Bispebjerg Hospital, between May 2013 and February 2015. All of the patients were treated with the nitinol proctology clip. Primary outcome was fistula healing after proctology clip placement, as evaluated through clinical examination, endoanal ultrasonography, and MRI. The fistula healing rate 1 year after the clip procedure was 54.3% (19 of 35 included patients). At the end of follow-up, 17 (49%) of 35 patients had persistent closure of the fistula tracks. No impairment of continence function was observed. Treatment outcome was not found to be statistically associated with any clinicopathological characteristics. The study is limited by its retrospective and nonrandomized design. Selection bias may have occurred, because treatment options other than the clip were available during the study period. The small number of patients means that there is a nonnegligible risk of type II error in the conclusion, and the follow-up may be too short to have detected all of the failures. Healing rates were comparable with those of other noninvasive, sphincter-sparing techniques for high-complex anocutaneous fistulas, with no risk of incontinence.

Few preliminary reports suggest that autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) can enhance wound repair and may be effective in treating pCD. Therefore, the aim of our study was to determine the efficacy of autologous PRP in the treatment of pCD.\n \n \n \n A prospective, uncontrolled, single center study in a referral IBD center was conducted between July 2018 and March 2021. Adult Crohn′s disease patients with pCD failing on antibiotics, immune suppression and/or biologics were eligible for the study. All patients had non-cutting setons for a minimal period of 6 weeks prior study intervention. Autologous PRP was separated by centrifugation 60 ml of peripheral blood in Harvest SmartPrep© System at the time of operation. After the seton removing, internal openings were closed by PDS 2/0 single suture and PRP was injected close to internal openings and fistula tracts. Patients were examined at outpatient clinic at week 1, month 1, 3, 6 and 12. Any suspected side-effects of the treatment were noted. Treatment effect was assessed by perianal Crohn Disease Activity Index (PCDAI assessed at baseline, month 1, 3, 6, 12) and van Assche MRI score (assessed at baseline and month 6 and 12). The primary end-point was complete healing at month 6 defined as closure of all external fistula openings and absence of abscess on MRI. The secondary end-point was sustained response at month 12.\n \n \n \n In total, 25 patients (pts) with pCD were included (mean age 36 years, range 21-61; 15 men). The majority of pts were using antiTNF biologics (9 adalimumab, 9 infliximab), 4 pts were treated by ustekinumab, one by vedolizumab, two patients were on immunomodulators monotherapy. By March 2021, 24 patients finished the 6 months and 21 patients the 12 months follow-up. The primary end-point of complete healing at month 6 was reached by 18 out of 24 pts (75%).

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Small bowel Crohn's disease (SBCD) is increasingly treated with biological therapies. Predicting response or remission (RoR) for individual patients is difficult and complicates treatment strategy. We aimed to determine if motility magnetic resonance imaging (mMRI) is superior to CRP and fecal calprotectin (FC) for the prediction of RoR at 1 year in patients commencing biologics for SBCD.<h4>Methods</h4>Prospective, multicenter (n = 13) cohort study of patients with active non-stricturing SBCD requiring anti-TNFα or anti-IL-12/23 treatment. We measured mMRI and CRP at baseline and post-induction (visit 2: 12-30 weeks), and FC in a subset. RoR was assessed at 1 year using clinical and structural magnetic resonance enterography parameters. We compared sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of changes in mMRI and CRP to predict RoR at 1 year. Secondary outcomes compared mMRI with FC, and prediction of improved quality of life (QoL).<h4>Results</h4>Eighty-six participants completed all assessments. Stable or improved mMRI at visit 2 was more sensitive than normalization of CRP for RoR (mMRI:71.0%, 95%CI 52.0-85.8; CRP:45.2%, 95%CI 27.3-64.0%, P = .008) but less specific (mMRI:30.9%, 95%CI 19.1-44.8; CRP:67.3%, 95%CI 53.3-79.3%, P < .001). There was no significant difference in ROC-AUC (mMRI:0.48; CRP:0.53, P = .65). Similar results were obtained for FC. None of mMRI, CRP, or FC predicted patient QoL at 1 year.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Although improved mMRI is more sensitive than CRP and FC to predict RoR at 1 year, it is less specific. No factor predicted patient QoL. Motility MRI remains a marker of disease activity at given timepoints.",

Despite several surgical procedures, they relapse in about two-thirds of patients, mandating innovative treatments. Ultrasmall particles of iron oxide (USPIO) have been described to achieve in vivo rapid healing of deep wounds in the skin and liver of rats thanks to their nanobridging capability that could be adapted to fistula treatment. Our main purpose was to highlight preclinical data with USPIO for the treatment of perianal fistulizing CD. Twenty male Sprague Dawley rats with severe 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid solution (TNBS)-induced proctitis were operated to generate two perianal fistulas per rat. At day 35, two inflammatory fistulas were obtained per rat and perineal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. After a baseline MRI, a fistula tract was randomly drawn and topically treated either with saline or with USPIO for 1 min (<i>n</i> = 17 for each). The rats underwent a perineal MRI on postoperative days (POD) 1, 4, and 7 and were sacrificed for pathological examination. The primary outcome was the filling or closure of the fistula tract, including the external or internal openings. USPIO treatment allowed the closure and/or filling of all the treated fistulas from its application until POD 7 in comparison with the control fistulas (23%). The treatment with USPIO was safe, permanently closed the fistula along its entire length, including internal and external orifices, and paved new avenues for the treatment of perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease.",

Material and methods It was a retrospective study of 23 patients suffering from CF admitted to a single specialist centre, who were treated with a combination of surgical and biological therapy.

Complete clinical response was achieved in 8 (35%) patients, whereas partial response occurred in 5 (22%) patients. Persistence of a fistula tract was visualised on MRI in 4 (50%) patients with clinical closure. Conclusions The healing process of CF should be monitored by MRI due to the discrepancy between premature closure of external openings and fistulous tracts.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with Crohn disease–related anal fistulas are treated with debridement of fistulous tracts and the placement of noncutting setons (NCSs). However, to reduce the high recurrence rate, there is still a need to develop more effective treatment methods. OBJECTIVE: To compare NCS with vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) treatment. METHODS: Medical records of 47 patients with Crohn anal fistulas were retrospectively evaluated. They were divided into two groups (I, VAC; II, NCS), consisting of 24 and 23 patients, respectively. The fistulas in the former group were applied with VAC, whereas NCSs were placed in the latter group. Fistula healing was evaluated with the Fistula Drainage Assessment classification, Perianal Disease Activity Index, and the van Assche MRI-Based Score. RESULTS: There was a significant difference (P = .006) between the groups; closure of all fistulas at 6 months after treatment was achieved in 18 patients (75%) from group 1, compared with 8 patients (35%) from group 2. Partial response occurred in five patients (21%) from group 1 and in five patients (22%) from group 2. Closure of fistulous tracts was visualized via MRI in nine patients (37.50%) from group 1, more than twice as many patients as from group 2. CONCLUSIONS: Because preliminary results of the study showed a high rate of closure after application of VAC to Crohn anal fistulas, this method might be considered a novel sphincter-saving procedure.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Crohn's disease (CD)-associated perianal fistulas are a challenging and debilitating complication, often resistant to standard medical and surgical treatments. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy, particularly using adipose- or bone marrow-derived MSCs (AMSCs/BM-MSCs), offers a promising regenerative approach, yet data on autologous BM-MSCs remain limited. Objective This pilot study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of autologous BM-MSCs in treating perianal fistulas in CD patients, and to identify potential predictive factors influencing treatment outcomes. Methods A single-center, prospective, single-blind randomized study was conducted over six months at Mohammed VI University Hospital in Marrakech, Morocco. Twenty CD patients with complex perianal fistulas unresponsive to conventional therapy were enrolled, of whom eight completed the 24-week follow-up. Patients were randomized into two groups: local BM-MSC administration only (CroMaPCs) and combined local plus intravenous administration (CroMaPCs+). Outcomes were assessed clinically and radiologically at Weeks 2, 6, and 24. Results At 24 weeks, complete fistula healing was observed in three patients (37.5%), with higher response and healing rates in the CroMaPCs+ group (50%) compared to the CroMaPCs group (25%). No treatment-related adverse events were reported. Factors such as age, immunosuppressive therapy, and combined BM-MSC intravenous administration may have influenced outcomes, although the small sample size limits definitive conclusions. Conclusion Autologous BM-MSC therapy appears safe and potentially effective in managing refractory perianal fistulas in CD. Combined local and systemic administration may enhance healing. Larger, controlled trials are needed to validate these findings and refine patient selection and treatment protocols.",

Our objective was to determine predictors of perianal fistula healing among pediatric patients newly diagnosed with Crohn disease. Methods: This single-center retrospective study followed patients with perianal fistulas at Crohn disease diagnosis until fistula healing. Time to healing was analyzed using Cox proportional hazard regression models considering relevant covariates including patient demographics, disease characteristics, medical therapies [no anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α therapy, anti-TNFα therapy ±therapeutic drug monitoring], and perianal surgical procedures including fistulotomy, fistulectomy, removal of perianal lesions, seton placement, and incision and drainage. Results: Of 485 patients identified, 107 (22%) had a perianal fistula at Crohn disease diagnosis. Multivariate analysis identified that perianal fistulotomy, fistulectomy, and lesion removal [hazard ratio (HR) 0.46; P = 0.028], non-White race (HR 0.30, P < 0.01), and male sex (HR 0.42; P = 0.02) were associated with delayed fistula healing. Faster fistula healing was associated with treatment with anti-TNFα with therapeutic drug monitoring (HR 1.78, P = 0.009). There were no other differences in healing by treatment. Conclusions: Fistulotomy, fistulectomy, and perianal lesion removal as well as non-White race were associated with delayed fistula healing. Anti-TNFα therapy was associated with faster fistula healing when combined with therapeutic drug monitoring, compared to all other medical treatment groups, including anti-TNFα therapy without therapeutic drug monitoring.",

AIM To determine the correlation between perianal fistula healing and closure with infliximab and adalimumab trough levels. METHODS In this multicentre retrospective study conducted across four tertiary inflammatory bowel disease centres in Australia, we identified CD patients with perianal fistulae on maintenance infliximab or adalimumab who had a trough level within twelve weeks of clinical assessment. Data collected included demographics, serum infliximab and adalimumab trough levels (mg/L) within 12 wk before or after their most recent clinical assessment and concomitant medical or surgical therapy. The primary outcome was fistula healing, defined as cessation in fistula drainage. The secondary outcome was fistula closure, defined as healing and closure of all external fistula openings. Differences between patients who did or did not achieve fistula healing were compared using the chi-square test, t test or Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS One hundred and fourteen patients (66 infliximab, 48 adalimumab) were included. Forty-eight (72.7%) patients on maintenance infliximab achieved fistula healing and 18 (27.3%) achieved fistula closure. Thirty-seven (77%) patients on maintenance adalimumab achieved fistula healing and 17 (35.4%) achieved fistula closure. Patients who achieved fistula healing had significantly higher infliximab and adalimumab trough levels than patients who did not [infliximab: 6.4 (3.8-9.5) vs 3.0 (0.3-6.2) mg/L, P = 0.003; adalimumab: 9.2 (6.5-12.0) vs 5.4 (2.5-8.3) mg/L, P = 0.004]. For patients on infliximab, fistula healing was associated with lower rates of detectable anti-infliximab antibodies and younger age. For patients on adalimumab, fistula healing was associated with higher rates of combination therapy with an immunomodulator. Serum trough levels for patients with and without fistula closure were not significantly different for infliximab [6.9 (4.3-10.2) vs 5.5 (2.5-8.3) mg/L, P = 0.105] or adalimumab [10.0 (6.6-12.0) vs 7.8 (4.2-10.0) mg/L, P = 0.083].

Approach and Results: We used 23 demographic/clinical variables to train superlearner(s) on data from the NASH-clinical research network observational study (n = 648) and validated models with data from the FLINT trial (n = 270) and National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) participants with NAFLD (n = 1244). Comparing the superlearner’s performance to existing models (Fibrosis-4 [FIB-4], NAFLD fibrosis score, Forns, AST to Platelet Ratio Index [APRI], BARD, and Steatosis-Associated Fibrosis Estimator [SAFE]), it exhibited strong discriminative ability in the FLINT and NHANES validation sets, with AUCs of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.73–0.84) and 0.74 (95% CI: 0.68–0.79) respectively. Conclusions: Notably, the SAFE score performed similarly to the superlearner, both of which outperformed FIB-4, APRI, Forns, and BARD scores in the validation data sets. Surprisingly, the superlearner derived from 12 base models matched the performance of one with 90 base models. Overall, the superlearner, being the “best-in-class” machine-learning predictor, excelled in detecting fibrotic NASH, and this approach can be used to benchmark the performance of conventional clinical risk prediction models.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Diabetic nephropathy (DN) has become a major public health burden in China. A more stable method is needed to reflect the different stages of renal function impairment. We aimed to determine the possible practicability of machine learning (ML)-based multimodal MRI texture analysis (mMRI-TA) for assessing renal function in DN. Methods For this retrospective study, 70 patients (between 1 January 2013 and 1 January 2020) were included and randomly assigned to the training cohort (n1 = 49) and the testing cohort (n2 = 21). According to the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), patients were assigned into the normal renal function (normal-RF) group, the non-severe renal function impairment (non-sRI) group, and the severe renal function impairment (sRI) group. Based on the largest coronal image of T2WI, the speeded up robust features (SURF) algorithm was used for texture feature extraction. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and relief and recursive feature elimination (RFE) were applied to select the important features and then support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), and random forest (RF) algorithms were used for the model construction. The values of area under the curve (AUC) on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were used to assess their performance. The robust T2WI model was selected to construct a multimodal MRI model by combining the measured BOLD (blood oxygenation level-dependent) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) values. Results The mMRI-TA model achieved robust and excellent performance in classifying the sRI group, non-sRI group, and normal-RF group, with an AUC of 0.978 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.963, 0.993), 0.852 (95% CI: 0.798, 0.902), and 0.972 (95% CI: 0.995, 1.000), respectively, in the training cohort and 0.961 (95% CI: 0.853, 1.000), 0.809 (95% CI: 0.600, 0.980), and 0.850 (95% CI: 0.638, 0.988), respectively, in the testing cohort. Discussion The model built from multimodal MRI on DN outperformed other models in assessing renal function and fibrosis.

In post hoc analyses, regional surface area, subcortical volumes as well as hyperparameter optimization did not improve the performance.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIndividuals at risk for bipolar disorder, as assessed by BPSS-P, display brain structural alterations that can be detected using machine learning. The achieved performance is comparable to previous studies which attempted to classify patients with manifest disease and healthy controls. Unlike previous studies of bipolar risk, our multicenter design permitted a leave-one-site-out cross-validation. Whole-brain cortical thickness seems to be superior to other structural brain features.",

The ranking of the different sequences was statistically tested by the Friedman analysis. The following ranking was found: HASTE sequences were ranked prior to contrast-enhanced axial gradient-echo (2D-FLASH). The third to fifth ranking was TrueFISP, the axial contrast-enhanced 2D-FLASH and the 2D-FLASH without contrast, respectively. Differences between the first and second rank were significant (p < 0.05), and all other differences were highly significant (p < 0.01). The stable and fast T2-weighted MR sequences without intravenous contrast represented by axial HASTE and coronal TrueFISP were ranked as number 1 and 3. The examination protocol should be completed by a coronal T1-weighted gradient-echo-sequence after contrast injection, which can be supplemented by an axial acquisition.

We assessed MM-SES-CD and SES-CD thresholds that are best associated with low likelihood of long-term disease progression.\n \n \n \n Week 48 endoscopy videos from patients with CD who participated in the CALM long-term extension LTE study were obtained and re-read by central readers to obtain a SES-CD and MM-SES-CD score, which was used for the derivation cohort. A real-world validation was performed with data from 99 patients that had clinical response using a mixed cohort of biologic therapies from the McMaster IBD database. The primary outcome was disease progression, defined as a new internal fistula/abscess, stricture, perianal fistula or abscess, CD-related hospitalization or surgery since the end of the CALM trial for the derivation cohort, and over the observed period of follow-up for the validation cohort. The maximum Youden index was calculated to determine the optimal MM-SES-CD and SES-CD thresholds. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses compared threshold scores of various remission definitions on disease progression. Kaplan-Meier survival curve analyses were performed to compare the time to disease progression from the end of study endoscopy in the derivation cohort.\n \n \n \n In the derivation cohort, the optimal thresholds associated with a low likelihood of disease progression were MM-SES-CD <22.5 and SES-CD <4. A significantly greater proportion of patients with a MM-SES-CD ≥22.5 had disease progression as compared to patients with MM-SES-CD <22.5 [10/17 (58.8%) vs. 3/44 (6.8%), p<0.001]. Similarly, a significantly greater number of patients with a SES-CD ≥ 4 had disease progression compared to those with a SES-CD <4 [11/25 (44.0%) vs. 2/36 (5.6%), p<0.001]. Compared to other clinical or endoscopic remission definitions, obtaining a MM-SES-CD <22.5 at the end of the CALM study performed the best for predicting disease progression [AUC: 0.81 (95% CI: 0.68-0.94), p<0.001](sensitivity 76.9% (95% CI: 46.2-95.0), specificity 85.4% (95% CI: 72.2-93.9)). Compared to those with lower scores, patients with MM-SES-CD ≥ 22.5 (log-rank p<0.0001) and SES-CD ≥ 4 (log-rank p=0.0002) had a significantly greater probability of disease progression (Figure 1A/B). These findings were confirmed in the validation cohort (Figure 1C/D).\n \n \n \n Achievement of MM-SES-CD <22.5 and SES-CD <4 was associated with low risk of CD progression and may be a suitable target for EH in clinical trials and practice.

At each centre, 10 inclusions, stratified by known or suspected CD location and duration, were planned. Clinical examination and abdominal MRI had to be performed in all patients, and upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, and pelvic MRI according to CD location. Upper tract (UT), small bowel (SB), colon/rectum (CR), and anus (AN) were divided into 3, 20, 6 and 1 segments, respectively. History of previous surgery was collected per segment. For each segment, 1 gastroenterologist and 1 radiologist per centre, identified the presence of predefined stricturing and/or penetrating lesions of maximal severity (grade 1 to 3) at each investigation. They provided a damage evaluation for each non-resected segment ranging from 0 to 10, 10 corresponding to the damage of a completely resected segment. Investigator organ damage evaluation was calculated as the sum of segmental damage evaluations. Finally, investigators provided a global damage evaluation from 0 to 10 for each patient according to the 4 organ damage scores, calculated as a function of investigator organ damage evaluations, resections and a total number of segments. The correlation between the investigator global damage evaluation and the LI was high on the construction sample, since coefficients to derive the LI were estimated by maximising this correlation, and is expected to be lower on data obtained in new patients by new investigators. Thus, the LI would be validated if the linear regression model of investigator global damage evaluation on LI shows a still high correlation.

The correlation coefficient between investigator global damage evaluation and the LI was 0.98 (Figure 1). Proportions of the investigator organ damage evaluation variance explained by each organ component of the LI were 82%, 91%, 89%, 65%, for UT, SB, CR, AN, respectively.

In rheumatoid arthritis, the anti-in ﬂ ammatory e ﬀ ects of anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) medications are reported to improve atherosclerotic disease burden. Our study describes the e ﬀ ect of anti-TNF therapy on the prevalence of CVA in IBD patients. Methods: We used a multi-institutional database (Explorys Inc, Cleveland, OH) which includes electronic health record data from 26 major integrated US healthcare systems.

Although it is subjectively described, no automated quantitative MRI-based measures have been developed.\n We aim to develop an automated methodology using contrast-less time of flight (TOF) Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA).\n \n \n \n A MATLAB algorithm was developed to track the vessels on a 3D maximum intensity projection of a TOF MRA data set and calculate an arborization Index which is the number of branching points in the intrabdominal vessels (figure 1). 2D TOF scans were acquired in the transverse plane between the top of the hip joint and L4 vertebra using a 3T Ingenia Wide bore scanner (Philips, The Netherlands). The primary outcome was a comparison of the arborization index between Crohn’s disease (CD) and healthy volunteers (HV) groups. A planned sub-analysis was undertaken across CD and HV matched for BMI to investigate the effect of visceral fat on the arborization index. Repeated measures were undertaken to evaluate the variability of the quantification method. No contrast agents were used for the TOF MRA scans. Biological variations within each group and test-retest repeatability were assessed using the coefficient of variation (CV). Statistical analysis with unpaired, two-tailed t-tests were conducted and differences were considered significant when the p-value ≤0.05. All absolute values are presented as mean ±standard deviation (SD).\n \n \n \n \n In this prospective pilot study, 7 CD patients (C-Reactive Protein=5.2±6.1 mg/L, Faecal Calprotectin 611±981μg/g, BMI=23±3 kg/m2) and 15 HVs (BMI=29±7 kg/m2) were recruited. Patients showed a significantly higher arborization index when compared to HVs (mean arborization in HV=94±21 and CD=139±26; p-value=0.002). The difference in arborization index persisted in a sub-analysis of 7 HVs (BMI=24±2 kg/m2) and 7 CD patients (mean arborization in matched HVs=101±22 vs mean index in CD=139±26; p=0.01) (Figure 2). The CV was 23% for HVs and 18% for CD indicating biological variation. Test-retest variability calculated from multiple TOF scans of the same subjects gave a mean CV of 6±5% for both groups combined.\n \n \n \n \n Our preliminary data suggest that the arborization index may be a useful measure of hypervascularity and hence intestinal inflammation in Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Further validation to standard disease activity measures is needed across larger cohorts to better investigate the utility of this potential biomarker as a non-invasive measure of disease activity and its reversibility to IBD therapies.\n \n \n \n 1.Turner,D.,et al.Gastro.2021;160(5):1570–1583.\n",

      "abstract": "Objective: Previous single-centre MRI data suggests an inverse correlation between normal small bowel motility variance and abdominal symptoms in Crohn’s disease (CD) patients. The current work prospectively assesses this observation in a larger, two-centre study. Methods: MR enterography datasets were analysed from 82 patients (38 male, aged 16–68), who completed a contemporaneous Harvey-Bradshaw index (HBI) questionnaire. Dynamic “cine motility” breath-hold balanced steady-state free precession sequences were acquired through the whole small bowel (SB) volume. Regions of interest (ROIs) were manually applied to encompass all morphologically normal SB (i.e. excluding Crohn’s affected bowel) and a validated registration technique used to produce motility maps. Mean and variance motility metrics were correlated with HBI and symptom components (well-being, pain and diarrhoea) using Spearman’s correlation statistics. Results: Overall, motility variance was non-significantly negatively correlated with the total HBI score, (r = −0.17, p = 0.12), but for subjects with a HBI score over 10, the negative correlation was significant (r = −0.633, p = 0.027). Motility variance was negatively correlated with diarrhoea (r = −0.29, p < 0.01). No significant correlation was found between mean motility and HBI (r = −0.02, p = 0.84). Conclusion: An inverse association between morphologically normal small bowel motility variance and patient symptoms has been prospectively confirmed in patients with HBI scores above 10. This association is particularly apparent for the symptom of diarrhoea. Advances in knowledge: This study builds on preliminary work by confirming in a large, well-controlled prospective multicentre study a relationship between normal bowel motility variance and patient reported symptoms which may have implications for drug development and clinical management.",

This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) for distinguishing PFCD from CAF based on pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n \n \n \n The MRIs from 400 patients primarily diagnosed with PFCD or CAF (two hundred respectively) were retrospectively collected as datasets and used in this study. All patients had no fistula associated surgical histories. The datasets were split into training (80%), validation (10%), and test(10%). Four different DCNNs, MobileNetV2, VGG11, ResNet18 and ResNet34, were trained to classify the patients with fistula MRIs as PFCD or as CAF. Both untrained and pretrained networks were used. Pretrained networks were obtained from the Pytorch Models, an open-access repository of pretrained models for use with Pytorch. The protocol was shown in Figure 1 and was approved by the institutional review board (2022ZSLYEC-421).On the test dataset, receiver operating characteristic curves and areas under the curve (AUCs) were used to assess model performances and were compared with the performances of radiologists. Comparisons between AUCs were made by using the Delong method. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were determined from the optimal threshold by the Youden index.\n \n Figure1.\n \n \n \n Compared with CAF, the PFCD dataset contained more high fistulas (59.5% vs. 44.5%，P=0.003), more fistulas involved in the deep anterior space (15.5% vs. 3.0%，P<0.001), and less abscess formation (32.5% vs. 59.5%，P<0.001). Other fistula characteristics including ramification formation, supra- or infralevator extension, were not statistically different. The performances of the pretrained models were better than that of the untrained models (Figure 2).

      "abstract": "Background: Perianal abscess is a clinical infective and/or inflammatory collection in the perianal region, one entity of a large group of anal and perianal disorders. Perianal abscesses are often seen as a complication of grade 2 and grade 4 perianal fistulas from St. James’s University Hospital classification. Several imaging modalities have been tried in the past for adequate assessment of perianal abscess with contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) providing the most accurate results. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is an emerging sequence that can provide comparable results to CE-MRI in diagnosing and characterizing perianal abscess. The main objective of this study is to assess the role of DWI in adequate identification and assessment of perianal abscess and compare the final results with contrast-enhanced images. Methods: Twenty patients with complicated perianal fistula with clinically suspected perianal abscess were evaluated with DWI and CE-MRI. This study was a comparative cross-sectional study conducted in the Department of Radiodiagnosis and Imaging, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhopal, India. Chi-square test was done to find the association between categorical variables. Kappa test was used to find the agreement between two different tests. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was done to estimate the area under the curve in predicting the outcome. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy were used to measure the validity of the tests. Results: DWI is a very sensitive MRI sequence and is equivalent to CE-MRI to detect the location and analyzing the loco-regional extent of abscess in complicated perianal fistula cases. DWI is also very sensitive and superior to T2 short tau inversion recovery (STIR) in differentiating perianal abscess from perianal inflammation without abscess. Conclusion: DWI can be used as an alternative to post-contrast fat-suppressed MRI in precisely defining the location and extent of anal and perianal abscesses and disease activity in complicated fistula cases.",

The manual inspection of data can be a laborious and error-prone process that is susceptible to human error. The development of automated tools aims to mitigate these issues. One such tool is pyfMRIqc, which we previously developed as a user-friendly method for assessing data quality. Yet, these methods still generate output that requires subjective interpretations about whether the quality of a given dataset meets an acceptable standard for further analysis. Here we present a quality control protocol using pyfMRIqc and assess the inter-rater reliability of four independent raters using this protocol for data from the fMRI Open QC project (https://osf.io/qaesm/). Data were classified by raters as either “include,” “uncertain,” or “exclude.” There was moderate to substantial agreement between raters for “include” and “exclude,” but little to no agreement for “uncertain.” In most cases only a single rater used the “uncertain” classification for a given participant’s data, with the remaining raters showing agreement for “include”/“exclude” decisions in all but one case. We suggest several approaches to increase rater agreement and reduce disagreement for “uncertain” cases, aiding classification consistency.",

      "doi": "",
      "abstract": "Automated detection of anatomical landmarks plays a crucial role in many diagnostic and surgical applications. Progresses in deep learning (DL) methods have resulted in significant performance enhancement in tasks related to anatomical landmark detection. While current research focuses on accurately localizing these landmarks in medical scans, the importance of inter-rater annotation variability in building DL models is often overlooked. Understanding how inter-rater variability impacts the performance and reliability of the resulting DL algorithms, which are crucial for clinical deployment, can inform the improvement of training data construction and boost DL models' outcomes. In this paper, we conducted a thorough study of different annotation-fusion strategies to preserve inter-rater variability in DL models for anatomical landmark detection, aiming to boost the performance and reliability of the resulting algorithms. Additionally, we explored the characteristics and reliability of four metrics, including a novel Weighted Coordinate Variance metric to quantify landmark detection uncertainty/inter-rater variability. Our research highlights the crucial connection between inter-rater variability, DL-models performances, and uncertainty, revealing how different approaches for multi-rater landmark annotation fusion can influence these factors.",

      "abstract": "Medical tasks are prone to inter-rater variability due to multiple factors such as image quality, professional experience and training, or guideline clarity. Training deep learning networks with annotations from multiple raters is a common practice that mitigates the model's bias towards a single expert. Reliable models generating calibrated outputs and reflecting the inter-rater disagreement are key to the integration of artificial intelligence in clinical practice. Various methods exist to take into account different expert labels. We focus on comparing three label fusion methods: STAPLE, average of the rater's segmentation, and random sampling of each rater's segmentation during training. Each label fusion method is studied using both the conventional training framework and the recently published SoftSeg framework that limits information loss by treating the segmentation task as a regression. Our results, across 10 data splittings on two public datasets, indicate that SoftSeg models, regardless of the ground truth fusion method, had better calibration and preservation of the inter-rater rater variability compared with their conventional counterparts without impacting the segmentation performance. Conventional models, i.e., trained with a Dice loss, with binary inputs, and sigmoid/softmax final activate, were overconfident and underestimated the uncertainty associated with inter-rater variability. Conversely, fusing labels by averaging with the SoftSeg framework led to underconfident outputs and overestimation of the rater disagreement. In terms of segmentation performance, the best label fusion method was different for the two datasets studied, indicating this parameter might be task-dependent. However, SoftSeg had segmentation performance systematically superior or equal to the conventionally trained models and had the best calibration and preservation of the inter-rater variability.",

      "abstract": "Inter-rater reliability (IRR) is one of the commonly used tools for assessing the quality of ratings from multiple raters. However, applicant selection procedures based on ratings from multiple raters usually result in a binary outcome; the applicant is either selected or not. This final outcome is not considered in IRR, which instead focuses on the ratings of the individual subjects or objects. We outline the connection between the ratings' measurement model (used for IRR) and a binary classification framework. We develop a simple way of approximating the probability of correctly selecting the best applicants which allows us to compute error probabilities of the selection procedure (i.e., false positive and false negative rate) or their lower bounds. We draw connections between the inter-rater reliability and the binary classification metrics, showing that binary classification metrics depend solely on the IRR coefficient and proportion of selected applicants. We assess the performance of the approximation in a simulation study and apply it in an example comparing the reliability of multiple grant peer review selection procedures. We also discuss possible other uses of the explored connections in other contexts, such as educational testing, psychological assessment, and health-related measurement and implement the computations in IRR2FPR R package.",

      "doi": "",
      "abstract": "In recent years, the qualitative research on empirical software engineering that applies Grounded Theory is increasing. Grounded Theory (GT) is a technique for developing theory inductively e iteratively from qualitative data based on theoretical sampling, coding, constant comparison, memoing, and saturation, as main characteristics. Large or controversial GT studies may involve multiple researchers in collaborative coding, which requires a kind of rigor and consensus that an individual coder does not. Although many qualitative researchers reject quantitative measures in favor of other qualitative criteria, many others are committed to measuring consensus through Inter-Rater Reliability (IRR) and/or Inter-Rater Agreement (IRA) techniques to develop a shared understanding of the phenomenon being studied. However, there are no specific guidelines about how and when to apply IRR/IRA during the iterative process of GT, so researchers have been using ad hoc methods for years. This paper presents a process for systematically applying IRR/IRA in GT studies that meets the iterative nature of this qualitative research method, which is supported by a previous systematic literature review on applying IRR/RA in GT studies in software engineering. This process allows researchers to incrementally generate a theory while ensuring consensus on the constructs that support it and, thus, improving the rigor of qualitative research. This formalization helps researchers to apply IRR/IRA to GT studies when various raters are involved in coding. Measuring consensus among raters promotes communicability, transparency, reflexivity, replicability, and trustworthiness of the research.",

The study is based on around 100,000 papers with recommendations from Faculty members. Even if intersubjectivity plays a fundamental role in science, the analyses of the reliability of the F1000Prime peer review system show a rather low level of agreement between Faculty members. This result is in agreement with most other studies which have been published on the journal peer review system. Logistic regression models are used to investigate the convergent validity of the F1000Prime peer review system.

MRE examinations were independently reviewed by three pediatric radiologists who indicated the presence vs. absence of ulcers, ulcer severity (categorical depth), and ulcer extent (categorical number of ulcers). Maximum bowel wall thickness and length of disease were measured and averaged across readers. Patient demographics and clinical inflammatory markers were documented from electronic health records. Inter-radiologist agreement was assessed using Fleiss' kappa (k) statistics. Student's t-test was used to compare continuous variables.<h4>Results</h4>Mean patient age was 13.9 years (67 [62%] boys). Radiologic ulcers were recorded in 64/108 (59.3%) cases by reader 1, 70/108 (64.8%) cases by reader 2, and 49/108 (45.4%) cases by reader 3 (k = 0.36). Based on majority consensus, radiologic ulcers were present in 60/108 (55.6%) participants. Inter-radiologist agreement for ulcer severity was k = 0.23, while ulcer extent was k = 0.66. There were significant differences in C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, fecal calprotectin, albumin, maximum bowel wall thickness, and length of disease between patients without and with radiologic ulcers (P < 0.05). The sensitivity and specificity of MRE for detecting endoscopic ulcers were 66.7% (95% CI, 52.1-79.2%) and 69.2% (95% CI, 48.2-85.7%), respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Radiologic ulcers are visible in children with newly diagnosed ileal CD, although inter-radiologist agreement is only fair. The presence of ulcers is associated with clinical laboratory inflammatory markers as well as other MRE findings of disease activity and is an additional imaging finding that can be used to evaluate intestinal inflammation.",

      "abstract": "Objectives: Quantify target volume delineation uncertainty for CT/MRI simulation and MRI-guided adaptive radiotherapy in rectal cancer. Define optimal imaging sequences for target delineation. Methods: Six experienced radiation oncologists delineated clinical target volumes (CTVs) on CT and 2D and 3D-MRI in three patients with rectal cancer, using consensus contouring guidelines. Tumour GTV (GTVp) was also contoured on MRI acquired week 0 and 3 of radiotherapy. A STAPLE contour was created and volume and interobserver variability metrics were analysed. Results: There were statistically significant differences in volume between observers for CT and 2D-MRI-defined CTVs (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference between observers on 3D-MRI. Significant differences in volume were seen between observers for both 2D and 3D-MRI-defined GTVp at weeks 0 and 3 (p < 0.05). Good interobserver agreement (IOA) was seen for CTVs delineated on all imaging modalities with best IOA on 3D-MRI; median Conformity index (CI) 0.74 for CT, 0.75 for 2D-MRI and 0.77 for 3D-MRI. IOA of MRI-defined GTVp week 0 was better compared to CT; CI 0.58 for CT, 0.62 for 2D-MRI and 0.7 for 3D-MRI. MRI-defined GTVp IOA week three was worse compared to week 0. Conclusion: Delineation on MRI results in smaller volumes and better IOA week 0 compared to CT. 3D-MRI provides the best IOA in CTV and GTVp. MRI-defined GTVp on images acquired week 3 showed worse IOA compared to week 0. This highlights the need for consensus guidelines in GTVp delineation on MRI during treatment course in the context of dose escalation MRI-guided rectal boost studies.

This study aims to evaluate these bursae, providing a comparative analysis of US and MRI, and explore associations with demographic, disease-related factors, pain, clinical examination, and baropodometryin RA patients.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nParticipants with RA were recruited from the day-hospital clinic. The forefeet were assessed clinically, and the selected foot was examined by US and MRI to evaluate intermetatarsal (IMB) and submetatarsal bursitis (SMB). Baropodometry assessed plantar pressures and contact surfaces.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThirty-five RA patients were enrolled, 85.7% females, mean age 59.2 (11.3) years, mean body mass index (BMI) 26.5 (5.7) kg/m2, median disease duration of 36.0 (16.5-114.0) months, and 34.3% with painful forefoot. A total of 140 intermetatarsal and 175 submetatarsal spaces were evaluated. Agreement between US and MRI was high (PA=97.14%, k=0.801, p<0.001), and interobserver reliability for both modalities was excellent (US: PA=98.73%, k=0.888, p<0.001; MRI: PA=98.41%, k=0.900, p<0.001). IMB was negatively associated with disease duration (the only independent predictor) and linked to clinical signs like the opening toes sign and hammer toe deformity. SMB showed an association with BMI and erosions. Baropodometric analysis indicated no significant differences in plantar pressures for IMB, and larger contact surfaces in SMB regions.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nUS and MRI are valuable tools for forefoot bursitis evaluation. IMB is associated with disease duration (negative association), the opening toes sign, and hammer toe deformity, while SMB correlates with BMI, erosions, and foot architectural deformity.

      "abstract": "BackgroundGTV delineation is the first crucial step in radiotherapy and requires high accuracy, especially with the growing use of highly conformal and adaptive radiotherapy techniques. If GTV delineations of observers concord, they are considered to be of high accuracy.The aim of the study is to determine the interobserver agreement for GTV delineations of supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma on CT and on CT combined with MR-images and to determine the effect of adding MR images to CT-based delineation on the delineated volume and the interobserver agreement.MethodsTwenty patients with biopsy proven T1-T4 supraglottic laryngeal cancer, treated with curative intent were included. For all patients a contrast enhanced planning CT and a 1.5-T MRI with gadolinium were acquired in the same head-and-shoulder mask for fixation as used during treatment. For MRI, a two element surface coil was used as a receiver coil. Three dedicated observers independently delineated the GTV on CT. After an interval of 2 weeks, a set of co-registered CT and MR-images was provided to delineate the GTV on CT. Common volumes (C) and encompassing volumes (E) were calculated and C/E ratios were determined for each pair of observers. The conformity index general (CIgen) was used to quantify the interobserver agreement. Results: In general, a large variation in interobserver agreement was found for CT (range: 0.29-0.77) as well as for CT-MR delineations (range: 0.17-0.80). The mean CIgen for CT (0.61) was larger compared to CT-MR (0.57) (p = 0.032). Mean GTV volume delineated on CT-MR (6.6 cm3) was larger compared to CT (5.6 cm3) (p = 0.002).ConclusionDelineation on CT with co-registered MR-images resulted in a larger mean GTV volume and in a decrease in interobserver agreement compared to CT only delineation for supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma.",

      "abstract": "Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract in which repeated episodes of acute inflammation may lead to long-term bowel damage. Cross-sectional imaging is used in conjunction with endoscopy to diagnose and monitor disease and detect complications. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has demonstrable utility in evaluating inflammatory activity. However, subjective interpretation of conventional MR sequences is limited in its ability to fully phenotype the underlying histopathological processes in chronic disease. In particular, conventional MRI can be confounded by the presence of mural fibrosis and muscle hypertrophy, which can mask or sometimes mimic inflammation. Quantitative MRI (qMRI) methods provide a means to better differentiate mural inflammation from fibrosis and improve quantification of these processes. qMRI may also provide more objective measures of disease activity and enable better tailoring of treatment. Here, we review quantitative MRI methods for imaging the small bowel in CD and consider the path to their clinical translation. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 2.",

      "abstract": "Although most spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhages (ICHs) are due to cerebral small vessel diseases (SVDs), between 1 in 7 and 1 in 10 are due to a macrovascular cause. Rapid diagnosis has important therapeutic and prognostic implications but sometimes requires digital subtraction angiography (DSA), an invasive procedure which cannot be performed in all patients. MRI provides optimal sensitivity for markers of SVD but was not included in previous risk stratification scores. We aimed to create and validate a risk stratification score for macrovascular causes of ICH including MRI findings to guide diagnosis and further investigations. We pooled data from 2 large observational study cohorts (London/United Kingdom and Graz/Austria) of consecutive patients with ICH who had brain MRI and at least 1 angiographic modality within 90 days of symptom onset. The primary outcome was a macrovascular cause of ICH (arteriovenous malformation/dural arteriovenous fistula, aneurysm, cavernoma, or cerebral venous thrombosis), with the diagnosis based on neurovascular multidisciplinary meetings. Using lasso logistic regression, we built the MRI Assessment of the Causes of intRacerebral haemOrrhage (MACRO) score to assess the probability of a macrovascular cause. We performed internal validation using bootstrapping and external validation in an independent cohort (Bern/Switzerland). We included 1,043 patients with ICH (mean age 66 years, 42% female), 78 of whom had a macrovascular cause (7.5%). The final score includes age (0-39, 40-69, or ≥70), location of ICH (lobar, deep, or infratentorial), and SVD markers on MRI (≥1 microbleed, ≥1 lacune, presence of cortical superficial siderosis, or white matter hyperintensities using the Fazekas scale). The MACRO score showed an optimism-adjusted <i>c</i>-statistic of 0.90 (95% CI 0.88-0.93), superior to existing CT-based scores (<i>p</i> < 0.001). In external validation, the <i>c</i>-statistic was 0.87 (95% CI 0.80-0.94). MACRO scores ≥6 (59.5% of patients) indicated a very low risk of a macrovascular cause (0.2%), while scores ≤2 (9% of patients) indicated a high risk (48.9%). The MRI-based MACRO score shows excellent performance in predicting the likelihood of macrovascular causes of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage, making it useful in guiding further investigations. Important limitations include the observational study design and the performance of DSA in a minority of patients.",

      "abstract": "Despite advances in resuscitation practice, patient survival following cardiac arrest remains poor. The utilization of MRI in neurological outcome prognostication post-cardiac arrest is growing and various classifications has been proposed; however a consensus has yet to be established. MRI, though valuable, is resource-intensive, time-consuming, costly, and not universally available. This study aims to validate a MRI lesion pattern score in a cohort of out of hospital cardiac arrest patients at a tertiary referral hospital in Switzerland. This cohort study spanned twelve months from February 2021 to January 2022, encompassing all unconscious patients aged ≥ 18 years who experienced out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of any cause and were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at Inselspital, University Hospital Bern, Switzerland. We included patients who underwent the neuroprognostication process, assessing the performance and validation of a MRI scoring system. Over the twelve-month period, 137 patients were admitted to the ICU, with 52 entering the neuroprognostication process and 47 undergoing MRI analysis. Among the 35 MRIs indicating severe hypoxic brain injury, 33 patients (94%) experienced an unfavourable outcome (UO), while ten (83%) of the twelve patients with no or minimal MRI lesions had a favourable outcome. This yielded a sensitivity of 0.94 and specificity of 0.83 for predicting UO with the proposed MRI scoring system. The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 5.53 and 0.07, respectively, resulting in an accuracy of 91.49%. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the MLP scoring scheme in predicting neurological outcome in patients following cardiac arrest. However, to ensure a comprehensive neuroprognostication, MRI results need to be combined with other assessments. While neuroimaging is a promising objective tool for neuroprognostication, given the absence of sedation-related confounders—compared to electroencephalogram (EEG) and clinical examination—the current lack of a validated scoring system necessitates further studies. Incorporating standardized MRI techniques and grading systems is crucial for advancing the reliability of neuroimaging for neuroprognostication.

Methods Two hundred and seventy-three patients with pathologically confirmed mHCC (≥2 lesions) without major vascular invasion and biliary tract tumor thrombosis, who underwent preoperative contrast-enhanced MRI and hepatectomy, were consecutively enrolled (training/validation cohort=193/80). Preoperative clinicoradiological variables were collected and analyzed. The multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine the independent predictors of MVI and create a risk score system. The C-index, calibration curve and decision curve were used to evaluate the performance of the risk score. A risk score-based prognostic stratification system was performed in mHCC patients. The risk score system was further verified in the validation cohort. Results AFP > 400 ng/mL, presence of satellite nodule, mosaic architecture and increased total tumor diameter were independent predictors of MVI while fat in mass was an independent protective factor of MVI. The risk score yielded satisfactory C-index values (training/validation cohort: 0.777/0.758) and fitted well in calibration curves. Decision curve analysis further confirmed its clinical utility. Based on the risk score, mHCC patients were stratified into high-/low-MVI-risk subgroups with significantly different recurrence-free survival (both P < 0.001). Conclusion The presented risk score incorporating clinicoradiological parameters could stratify mHCC patients into high-risk and low-risk subgroups and predict prognosis in patients with resectable mHCC.",

We sought to determine if CMR parameters result in further discrimination of risk prediction.\n \n \n Methods:\n We evaluated 1414 ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM vs NICM) patients, who were referred for CMR between 2001-2017. The primary endpoint was the composite event of death, transplant, or LVAD. The data was split equally into development and validation cohorts using stratified randomization with presence/absence of an event and ICM/NICM as the two strata. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was first developed in the training patient cohort using only the MAGGIC score alone (baseline model). CMR measures with associated interactions with sex were then added to the baseline model in addition to ICM vs NICM categorization. The final fitted model was tested on a validation cohort of 704 patients. Uno concordance index was estimated with Wald test to assess significance.\n \n \n Results:\n There were 782 ICM patients and 674 NICM patients, with the following characteristics: 31.8% female, mean age 58±14 years, LVEDVi 131±45.0 mL/m\n 2\n , LVEF 30±11%, LAEF 38±17%, RVEF 43±13%, LGE 8±11% and mitral regurgitant fraction 15±15%.

The MAGGIC score was a significant predictor of outcomes with a c-index of 0.635±0.0190, which increased to 0.656±0.0154 after adding CMR features and cardiomyopathy classification in the validation cohort (\n p<0.001 for c-index difference\n ). Interaction of male sex and LVEDVi and RVEF yielded a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of -0.0077 (p=0.003) and 0.016 (p=0.023) respectively, suggesting attenuated impact of increasing LVEDVi and declining RVEF on risk in men compared to women.\n \n \n Conclusion:\n Integration of CMR parameters with novel sex interactions with the MAGGIC score significantly improves discrimination of risk.

      "abstract": "Abstract Background: Gleason score grading is a cornerstone of risk stratification and management of patients with prostate cancer (PCa). In this work, we derive and validate a nomogram that uses prostate multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MP-MRI) and clinical patient characteristics to predict biopsy Gleason scores (bGS). Materials and methods: A predictive nomogram was derived from 143 men who underwent MP-MRI prior to any prostate biopsy and then validated on an independent cohort of 235 men from a different institution who underwent MP-MRI for PCa workup. Screen positive lesions were defined as lesions positive on T2W and DWI sequences on MP-MRI. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) density, number of screen positive lesions, and MRI suspicion were associated with PCa Gleason score on biopsy and were used to generate a predictive nomogram. The independent cohort was tested on the nomogram and the most likely bGS was noted. Results: The mean PSA in the validation cohort was 9.25ng/mL versus 6.8ng/mL in the original cohort (p = 0.001). The distribution of Gleason scores between the 2 cohorts were not significantly different (p = 0.7). In the original cohort of men, the most probable nomogram generated Gleason score agreed with actual pathologic bGS findings in 61% of the men. In the validation cohort, the most likely nomogram predicted bGS agreed with actual pathologic bGS 51% of the time. The nomogram correctly identified any PCa versus non-PCa 63% of the time and clinically significant (Gleason score ≥ 7) PCa 69% of the time. The negative predictive value for clinically significant PCa using this prebiopsy nomogram was 74% in the validation group. Conclusions: A preintervention nomogram based on PSA and MRI findings can help narrow down the likely pathologic finding on biopsy. Validation of the nomogram demonstrated a significant ability to correctly identify the most likely bGS. This feasibility study demonstrates the potential of a prebiopsy prediction of bGS and based on the high negative predictive value, identification of men who may not need biopsies, which could impact future risk stratification for PCa.",

In 1976, Parks et al classified AF into inter-sphincteric, trans-sphincteric, supra-sphincteric, and extra-sphincteric based on sphincter anatomy. This system overlooks complex features, which prompted Emile et al to incorporate risk factors into a modified version. In this retrospective cohort study, the external validity of this new classification will be investigated. Methods: A retrospective cohort design will be used and patients with cryptoglandular anal fistula who had preoperative MRI will be consecutively enrolled. Patients will be categorized according to the modified Parks classification. We will use descriptive analysis to describe imaging and clinical data. Moreover, logistic regression will be employed to develop a predictive model for recurrence. A P <0.05 will be considered significant, and the results will be reported with 95% confidence intervals (CI), if applicable. The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee.

The primary outcome was POPF (International Study Group on Pancreatic Surgery grade B/C). Model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC; discrimination) and calibration plots. Validation included univariable screening for clinical variables that could improve performance.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOverall, 202 of 952 patients (21%) developed POPF after MIPD. Before adjustment, the original a-FRS performed moderately (AUC 0.68) and calibration was inadequate with systematic underestimation of the POPF risk. Single-row pancreatojejunostomy (odds ratio 4.6, 95 confidence interval [CI] 2.8-7.6) and male sex (odds ratio 1.9, 95 CI 1.4-2.7) were identified as important risk factors for POPF in MIPD. The updated a-FRS, consisting of body mass index, pancreatic texture, duct size, and male sex, showed good discrimination (AUC 0.75, 95 CI 0.71-0.79) and adequate calibration. Performance was adequate for laparoscopic, robot-assisted, and hybrid MIPD and open pancreatoduodenectomy.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe updated a-FRS (www.pancreascalculator.com) now includes male sex as a risk factor and is validated for both MIPD and open pancreatoduodenectomy. The increased risk of POPF in laparoscopic MIPD was associated with single-row pancreatojejunostomy, which should therefore be discouraged.",

      "abstract": "Objective To develop and validate a risk score based on preoperative clinical-radiological parameters for predicting overall survival (OS) in patients undergoing surgical resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods From July 2010 to December 2021, consecutive patients with surgically-proven HCC who underwent preoperative contrast-enhanced MRI were retrospectively enrolled. A preoperative OS risk score was constructed in the training cohort using a Cox regression model and validated in a propensity score-matched internal validation cohort and an external validation cohort. Results A total of 520 patients were enrolled, among whom 210, 210, and 100 patients were from the training, internal validation, and external validation cohorts, respectively. Independent predictors for OS included incomplete tumor “capsule,” mosaic architecture, tumor multiplicity, and serum alpha-fetoprotein, which were incorporated into the “OSASH score.” The C-index the OSASH score was 0.85, 0.81, and 0.62 in the training, internal, and external validation cohorts, respectively. Using 32 as the cutoff point, the OSASH score stratified patients into prognostically distinct low- and high-risk groups among all study cohorts and six subgroups (all p  < 0.05). Furthermore, patients with BCLC stage B-C HCC and OSASH-low risk achieved comparable OS to that of patients with BCLC stage 0-A HCC and OSASH-high risk in the internal validation cohort (5-year OS rates, 74.7 vs. 77.8%; p  = 0.964). Conclusion The OSASH score may help predict OS in HCC patients undergoing hepatectomy and identify potential surgical candidates among those with BCLC stage B-C HCC. Clinical relevance statement By incorporating three preoperative MRI features and serum AFP, the OSASH score may help predict postsurgical overall survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and identify potential surgical candidates among those with BCLC stage B and C HCC. Key Points • The OSASH score incorporating three MRI features and serum AFP can be used to predict OS in HCC patients who received curative-intent hepatectomy. • The score stratified patients into prognostically distinct low- and high-risk strata in all study cohorts and six subgroups. • Among patients with BCLC stage B and C HCC, the score identified a subgroup of low-risk patients who achieved favorable outcomes after surgery.",

Therefore, this study aimed to develop an MRI-based deep learning score (DLS) to non-invasively assess PD-L1 expression status in HNSCC patients and evaluate its potential effeciency in predicting prognostic stratification following treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). In this study, we collected data from four patient cohorts comprising a total of 610 HNSCC patients from two separate institutions. We developed deep learning models based on the ResNet-101 convolutional neural network to analyze three MRI sequences (T1WI, T2WI, and contrast-enhanced T1WI). Tumor regions were manually segmented, and features extracted from different MRI sequences were fused using a transformer-based model incorporating attention mechanisms. The model’s performance in predicting PD-L1 expression was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and calibration metrics. Survival analyses were conducted using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank tests to evaluate the prognostic significance of the DLS. The DLS demonstrated high predictive accuracy for PD-L1 expression, achieving an AUC of 0.981, 0.860 and 0.803 in the training, internal and external validation cohort. Patients with higher DLS scores demonstrated significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) in both the internal validation cohort (hazard ratio: 0.491; 95% CI, 0.270–0.892; P = 0.005) and the external validation cohort (hazard ratio: 0.617; 95% CI, 0.391–0.973; P = 0.040). In the ICI-treated cohort, the DLS achieved an AUC of 0.739 for predicting durable clinical benefit (DCB). The proposed DLS offered a non-invasive and accurate approach for assessing PD-L1 expression in patients with HNSCC and effectively stratified HNSCC patients to benefit from immunotherapy based on PFS.",

As predictive tools are lacking, this study aims to develop a clinical-imaging nomogram to assess ATM risk and support precision diagnosis and treatment in PAHSCI.<h4>Methods</h4>We retrospectively analyzed clinical data from patients under 14 years of age diagnosed with thoracic PAHSCI between January 2012 and January 2023. All patients underwent lumbar puncture, gadolinium-enhanced imaging, and whole-spine MRI. Clinical history and imaging findings were collected, and the diagnosis of ATM was determined according to the Transverse Myelitis Consortium Working Group criteria. Patients were randomly assigned to training and validation cohorts in a 7:3 ratio. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to identify potential risk factors for ATM, which were then incorporated into a multivariable logistic regression model to construct a predictive nomogram. Model discrimination and calibration were assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration plots, and Brier scores. Internal validation was performed via 1,000-bootstrap resampling to generate 95% confidence intervals. Model goodness-of-fit was evaluated with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, and clinical utility was assessed using decision curve analysis (DCA).<h4>Results</h4>LASSO regression and multivariate logistic regression identified five predictors: age, fall, latent activity, flow void, and pinprick sensation score, which were used to construct a nomogram for estimating the risk of ATM in PAHSCI patients. The model demonstrated strong discriminative performance, with AUCs of 0.876 (95% CI: 0.803-0.950) in the training set and 0.844 (95% CI: 0.709-0.979) in the validation set. Calibration was satisfactory in both cohorts, as evidenced by the Hosmer-Lemeshow test (training: <i>χ</i> <sup>2</sup> = 5.638, <i>p</i> = 0.776; validation: <i>χ</i> <sup>2</sup> = 9.666, <i>p</i> = 0.378) and low Brier scores (0.138 and 0.167, respectively). Decision curve analysis indicated substantial net clinical benefit within risk thresholds of 8%-99% in the training cohort and 6%-71% in the validation cohort.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We developed a preliminary nomogram demonstrating strong predictive accuracy for estimating ATM risk in PAHSCI patients, thereby enabling clinicians to adopt individualized therapeutic strategies.",

      "abstract": "Infected necrotizing pancreatitis (INP) is a severe complication of acute pancreatitis (AP) associated with high morbidity and mortality, yet regional data remain limited. We retrospectively reviewed 119 patients admitted with AP to the King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, between 2017 and 2025 to characterize risk factors, microbiological profiles, and management strategies. Of these patients, 21 (17.6%) developed INP. Compared with patients with noninfected AP, they were older (mean 60.1 ± 11.2 years, <i>p</i> < 0.05), were more frequently overweight or obese (85.7% ≥ 25 kg/m², <i>p</i> = 0.03), and had higher severity scores (Bedside Index for Severity in Acute Pancreatitis ≥3 in 61.9%, <i>p</i> < 0.01). These baseline differences could explain outcomes rather than infection status. Gallstones (42.9%) and exposure to glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (4.8%) were associated with INP. Radiologic imaging confirmed necrosis in all cases, including five abscesses. Of the 21 INP cases, 19 were confirmed by positive cultures from fine-needle aspiration (FNA), drainage, or necrosectomy and 2 by imaging (gas in necrotic collections) plus blood cultures. Microbiological cultures obtained from FNA, drainage, or necrosectomy most commonly identified <i>Escherichia coli</i> (42.9%) and <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> (23.8%), with multidrug resistance detected in one-third of cases. Management strategies included conservative therapy (<i>n</i> = 8), percutaneous drainage (<i>n</i> = 4), endoscopic necrosectomy (<i>n</i> = 5), and surgical necrosectomy (<i>n</i> = 4). Complications included pancreatic fistula, colonic perforation, and sepsis, with an overall mortality rate of 9.5%. Antibiotics were culture-directed in INP but frequently used prophylactically in severe noninfected AP. Early enteral nutrition was implemented in most infected cases. These preliminary findings-limited by a small sample size, single-center design, and a bias toward severe cases-require validation in larger studies; nevertheless, they suggest that older age, obesity, severe presentation, and multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae are defining features of INP in this cohort, and they underscore the importance of antibiotic stewardship and early nutritional support in regional clinical practice.",

Although the Lémann Index (LI) remains the standard for BD assessment, its clinical utility is limited by heavy reliance on extensive clinical data. Multiparametric magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) provides noninvasive macroscopic evaluation of BD severity, however, it fails to characterize microscopic alterations. We therefore integrated MRE with gut microbiome and metabolomic data to uncover mechanistic insights and develop a comprehensive model for better prediction of BD.<h4>Methods and results</h4>In this prospective two-center study, 309 CD patients were stratified into BD and non-BD groups using LI. Patients underwent MRE, fecal 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and fecal/serum metabolomic analysis. Thirty healthy controls were included for comparison. The relationships between microbial/metabolic factors and MRE features were explored using correlation and mediation analyses. Seven machine learning algorithms, each paired with seven distinct combinations of multi-omics features, were evaluated using nested 5-fold cross-validation to construct an optimal prediction model. BD patients exhibited reduced gut microbial diversity (<i>P</i><0.05), with <i>Erysipelatoclostridium</i> and <i>[Ruminococcus]_gnavus_group</i> as key discriminators. Metabolomics revealed elevated fecal aromatic amino acids and depleted serum glycerophospholipids/sphingolipids (<i>P</i><0.05) linked to MRE-quantified features through mediation by microbial pathways (eg, 22.8% mediation effect of <i>Prevotella_9</i> on penetration, <i>P</i> <sub>ACME</sub>=0.022). The optimal Xtreme Gradient Boosting Classifier (XGBC) model integrating three microbial genera, six fecal metabolites, three serum metabolites, and three MRE features achieved superior performance (AUC 0.857 and 0.829 in the derivation and external validation cohorts, respectively). SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis prioritized perianal diseases, <i>Erysipelatoclostridium</i>, and fecal alanine as key contributors.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our study underscores the interplay between gut microbial dysbiosis, metabolic alterations, and MRE-quantified structural changes in BD patients.

Towards overcoming these issues, we present a novel approach which integrates self-configuring segmentation frameworks (nnU-net) with generalized foundation models (MedSAM) toward the task of automated segmentation of fistula tracts and as well as internal and external sphincter muscles on pelvic MRI. We utilized a cohort comprising both baseline and follow-up MRI scans from 92 CD-PAF patients, for which manual annotations of all three anorectal structures were available. In hold-out validation, the integrated MedSAM-nnUnet model yielded the best overall performance in segmenting out the internal (Dice of 0.96 ± 0.18) and external sphincter muscles (Dice of 0.59 ± 0.09), as well as perianal fistulae (Dice of 0.55 ± 0.09); which represented significant improvements over MedSAM and nnU-net models individually.

The study participants were randomly divided into training and internal validation sets.

Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) was employed to improve the interpretability of the optimal model. We retrospectively included 1609 patients with CHB, among whom 470 were diagnosed with cirrhosis. Cirrhosis was diagnosed based on histological confirmation or clinical assessment, supported by characteristic findings on abdominal ultrasound and corroborative evidence such as thrombocytopenia, varices or imaging from CT/MRI. In the internal validation, the RF model achieved an accuracy above 0.80 and an AUC above 0.80, with outstanding calibration ability and clinical net benefit. Additionally, the model exhibited excellent predictive performance in an independent external validation set. The SHAP analysis indicated that LSM contributed the most to the model.

      "abstract": "Purpose This study aimed to investigate the value of a machine learning-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiomics model in predicting the risk of recurrence within 1 year following an acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Methods The MRI and clinical data of 612 patients diagnosed with AIS at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University from March 1, 2019, to March 5, 2021, were obtained. The patients were divided into recurrence and non-recurrence groups according to whether they had a recurrent stroke within 1 year after discharge. Randomized splitting was used to divide the data into training and validation sets using a ratio of 7:3. Two radiologists used the 3D-slicer software to label the lesions on brain diffusion-weighted (DWI) MRI sequences. Radiomics features were extracted from the annotated images using the pyradiomics software package, and the features were filtered using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression analysis. Four machine learning algorithms, logistic regression (LR), Support Vector Classification (SVC), LightGBM, and Random forest (RF), were used to construct a recurrence prediction model. For each algorithm, three models were constructed based on the MRI radiomics features, clinical features, and combined MRI radiomics and clinical features. The sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) were used to compare the predictive efficacy of the models. Results Twenty features were selected from 1,037 radiomics features extracted from DWI images. The LightGBM model based on data with three different features achieved the best prediction accuracy from all 4 models in the validation set. The LightGBM model based solely on radiomics features achieved a sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of 0.65, 0.671, and 0.647, respectively, and the model based on clinical data achieved a sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of 0.7, 0.799, 0.735, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of the LightGBM model base on both radiomics and clinical features achieved the best performance with a sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of 0.85, 0.805, 0.789, respectively. Conclusion The ischemic stroke recurrence prediction model based on LightGBM achieved the best prediction of recurrence within 1 year following an AIS. The combination of MRI radiomics features and clinical data improved the prediction performance of the model.",

Radiomics features were manually extracted on volumes of interest on post-contrast T1-weighted images at the portal venous phase (PVP). Tumor-based response assessment was evaluated 6 months post-treatment using mRECIST. A logistic regression model was used to predict binary response outcome [complete response at 6 months with no-re-treatment (response group) against the rest (non-response group, including partial response, progressive disease, stable disease and complete response after re-treatment within 6 months after radiation segmentectomy) using baseline clinical parameters and radiomics features. We accessed the value of different sets of predictors using cross-validation technique. AUCs were compared using DeLong tests. A total 168 HCCs (mean size 2.9 ± 1.7 cm) were analyzed in 154 patients. The response group consisted of 113 HCCs and the non-response group of 55 HCCs. Baseline clinical parameters (AUC 0.531; sensitivity, 0.781; specificity, 0.279; positive predictive value (PPV), 0.345; negative predictive value (NPV), 0.724) and AFP (AUC 0.632; sensitivity, 0.833; specificity, 0.466; PPV, 0.432; NPV, 0.851) showed poor performance for response prediction. The model using a combination of radiomics features and clinical parameters/AFP showed the best performance (AUC 0.736; sensitivity, 0.706; specificity, 0.662; PPV 0.504; NPV, 0.822), significantly better than the clinical model (p < 0.001) or AFP alone (p < 0.001). The combination of radiomics features from pre-treatment MRI with clinical parameters and AFP showed fair performance for predicting HCC response to radiation segmentectomy, better than that of AFP.

      "abstract": "Abstract\n        Purpose During MRI/US fusion biopsy targeted and systematic sampling is performed. Systematic sampling adds up to 14% to the cancer detection rate but increases the complication rates. Since, only the highest risk prostate cancer determines the treatment course, systematic sampling with lower risk cancer compared to the targeted sampling is redundant. Our aim is to develop a prediction model to predict which patient will harbor higher risk prostate cancer in the systematic compared to the targeted biopsy in prostate fusion biopsy.Methods We included all patients who underwent fusion biopsy. Clinical and radiographic variables were collected from patients records. The outcome of the model was higher risk prostate cancer in the systematic compared with targeted biopsies. Extreme Gradient boosting model was trained and tested. We evaluated variable importance and clinical benefit.Results Five hundred and twenty-nine patients were included. 82 (15.5%) patients had higher risk prostate cancer in the systematic biopsies. The area under the ROC curve and negative predictive value were 0.82 and 0.92, respectively. The 4 most important features for outcome prediction were prostate volume, PSAD, patient's age and PSA. The decision curve showed increased clinical benefit of our model at threshold probabilities of 0-0.5. Limitations include the retrospective design of the study and lack of external validation of the model.Conclusions We developed a prediction model able to accurately predict which patient must undergo systematic and targeted biopsy. This prediction model has the potential to help in the decision whether to perform SB and thus may lower adverse event rate while keeping high detection rate.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n        Background: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a severe and progressive vascular disease for which early diagnosis and risk stratification are critical for improving patient outcomes. However, current diagnostic approaches exhibit limitations in achieving precise risk prediction. This study aimed to develop and validate a machine learning-based risk prediction model that integrates MRI-derived variables for PH risk assessment.\nMethods: This retrospective study enrolled 210 participants who underwent MRI at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University between January 2021 and December 2023, including 87 PH patients and 123 controls. Key MRI features were selected through recursive feature elimination (RFE) with a Random Forest algorithm. Multiple machine learning models, including XGBoost and logistic regression, were trained and evaluated employing 10-fold cross-validation. Model performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). SHAP analysis was utilized to interpret the contribution of individual features, and a nomogram integrating MRI and clinical variables was developed for personalized risk prediction.\nResults: Six key MRI-derived features were identified, among which pulmonary artery diameter and left atrial anterior-posterior diameter were the most significant predictors. The XGBoost model exhibited the best performance, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) values of 1.0 and 0.969 in the training and testing sets, respectively. Calibration curves demonstrated excellent agreement between predicted and observed outcomes. DCA revealed high net clinical benefits across a range of risk thresholds. The developed nomogram offers an intuitive tool for individualized PH risk prediction, demonstrating strong interpretability and clinical utility.\nConclusion: This study developed a highly accurate and reliable machine learning-based risk prediction model for PH based on MRI-derived features. By integrating SHAP analysis and a nomogram, the model provides a novel, non-invasive approach for early diagnosis and personalized risk stratification of PH, highlighting the significant potential for clinical application.",

The Simplified Magnetic Resonance Index of Activity (sMARIA) is a validated scoring system used to quantify Crohn's disease (CD) activity based on Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE) findings. This study aims to evaluate the performance of two advanced LLMs in extracting key imaging features and computing sMARIA scores from free-text MRE reports. This retrospective study included 117 anonymized free-text MRE reports from patients with confirmed CD. ChatGPT (GPT-4o) and DeepSeek (DeepSeek-R1) were prompted using a structured input designed to extract four key radiologic features relevant to sMARIA: bowel wall thickness, mural edema, perienteric fat stranding, and ulceration. LLM outputs were evaluated against radiologist annotations at both the segment and feature levels. Segment-level agreement was assessed using accuracy, mean absolute error (MAE) and Pearson correlation. Feature-level performance was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-score. Errors including confabulations were recorded descriptively. ChatGPT achieved a segment-level accuracy of 98.6%, MAE of 0.17, and Pearson correlation of 0.99. DeepSeek achieved 97.3% accuracy, MAE of 0.51, and correlation of 0.96. At the feature level, ChatGPT yielded an F1-score of 98.8% (precision 97.8%, sensitivity 99.9%), while DeepSeek achieved 97.9% (precision 96.0%, sensitivity 99.8%). LLMs demonstrate near-human accuracy in extracting structured information and computing sMARIA scores from free-text MRE reports. This enables automated assessment of CD activity without altering current reporting workflows, supporting longitudinal monitoring and large-scale research. Integration into clinical decision support systems may be feasible in the future, provided appropriate human oversight and validation are ensured.",

      "abstract": "Risk calculators (RCs) improve patient selection for prostate biopsy with clinical/demographic information, recently with prostate MRI using the prostate imaging reporting and data system (PI-RADS). Fully-automated deep learning (DL) analyzes MRI data independently, and has been shown to be on par with clinical radiologists, but has yet to be incorporated into RCs. The goal of this study is to re-assess the diagnostic quality of RCs, the impact of replacing PI-RADS with DL predictions, and potential performance gains by adding DL besides PI-RADS. One thousand six hundred twenty-seven consecutive examinations from 2014 to 2021 were included in this retrospective single-center study, including 517 exams withheld for RC testing. Board-certified radiologists assessed PI-RADS during clinical routine, then systematic and MRI/Ultrasound-fusion biopsies provided histopathological ground truth for significant prostate cancer (sPC). nnUNet-based DL ensembles were trained on biparametric MRI predicting the presence of sPC lesions (UNet-probability) and a PI-RADS-analogous five-point scale (UNet-Likert). Previously published RCs were validated as is; with PI-RADS substituted by UNet-Likert (UNet-Likert-substituted RC); and with both UNet-probability and PI-RADS (UNet-probability-extended RC). Together with a newly fitted RC using clinical data, PI-RADS and UNet-probability, existing RCs were compared by receiver-operating characteristics, calibration, and decision-curve analysis. Diagnostic performance remained stable for UNet-Likert-substituted RCs. DL contained complementary diagnostic information to PI-RADS. The newly-fitted RC spared 49% [252/517] of biopsies while maintaining the negative predictive value (94%), compared to PI-RADS ≥ 4 cut-off which spared 37% [190/517] (p < 0.001). Incorporating DL as an independent diagnostic marker for RCs can improve patient stratification before biopsy, as there is complementary information in DL features and clinical PI-RADS assessment. For patients with positive prostate screening results, a comprehensive diagnostic workup, including prostate MRI, DL analysis, and individual classification using nomograms can identify patients with minimal prostate cancer risk, as they benefit less from the more invasive biopsy procedure. The current MRI-based nomograms result in many negative prostate biopsies. The addition of DL to nomograms with clinical data and PI-RADS improves patient stratification before biopsy. Fully automatic DL can be substituted for PI-RADS without sacrificing the quality of nomogram predictions. Prostate nomograms show cancer detection ability comparable to previous validation studies while being suitable for the addition of DL analysis.

Materials and Methods In this prospective clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov registration no. NCT03585660), 91 male participants (mean age, 65 years ± 8 [SD]) with known or suspected prostate cancer underwent 3-T MRI with a conventional mpMRI protocol and HM-MRI followed by subsequent biopsy between August 2018 and March 2023. Using the HM-MRI tool, tissue composition was calculated using a three-compartment model, and suspected prostate cancer regions with elevated epithelium (>40%) and reduced lumen (<20%) meeting the minimum size requirement of 25 mm2 were identified. Up to two additional biopsy targets per participant were automatically selected with the HM-MRI tool in addition to the biopsy targets selected based on an expert radiologist's mpMRI interpretation (≥PI-RADS 3) using an MRI/US fusion biopsy device. Additional 12-core transrectal US-guided sextant random biopsy cores were also obtained. Detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (≥Gleason 3+4) was compared between HM-MRI and mpMRI by calculating area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and diagnostic accuracy metrics. Results The diagnostic performance of HM-MRI was either higher than mpMRI or showed no evidence of a difference when compared with mpMRI. On a per-participant basis, HM-MRI had significantly higher accuracy (55% vs 44%; P = .02) and specificity (36% vs 14%: P = .002) than mpMRI. On a per-lesion basis, HM-MRI had significantly higher accuracy (58% vs 39%; P < .001) and positive predictive value (31% vs 22%; P = .004) compared with mpMRI. Only one lesion was missed when using the combination of mpMRI and HM-MRI. On a per-sextant basis, HM-MRI showed significantly better performance than mpMRI for all metrics, including primary end points of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.76 vs 0.65; P < .001) and accuracy (83.9% vs 79.0%; P = .006). Conclusion This study demonstrates that HM-MRI has the potential to improve MRI/US fusion biopsy results for prostate cancer detection by providing complementary information to PI-RADS-based evaluation by expert radiologists.

This article aims to explore the risk factors for postoperative recurrence in CD, predictive indicators of recurrence, and prevention of recurrence, as well as how patients can better manage themselves after surgery.\n \n \n \n A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical data of 72 patients with Crohn's disease who underwent intestinal resection surgery.

MR imaging may document specific features that may help to foresee Crohn's disease in patients making an initial presentation. OBJECTIVE: Present MR imaging findings of perianal fistulas in patients making an initial presentation. DESIGN: Retrospective, observational. SETTING: Radiology clinic in in Dhahran. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All previously undiagnosed and untreated patients who presented for the first time to the outpatient clinics from September 2015-2018 with perianal fistulas were retrospectively evaluated. Previously diagnosed CD patients, post-surgical or intervention cases were excluded. Fistulas were categorized as low or high anal, simple or complex, and were graded per St. James University Hospital Classification. Imaging was interpreted by two experienced readers based on the Van Assche score. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Fistula features on MR imaging and diagnosis of CD. SAMPLE SIZE: 171 patients. RESULTS: Of 171 patients, 139 (81.3%) were males with mean age of 37.2 (12.7) years; the 32 females had a mean age of 35.8 (10.6) years. Twenty-one patients (12.3%) had CD. Fourteen (40.4%) patients with complex fistulas had CD in comparison to only 5 (4.8%) simple fistula patients (P=.0005). More than half of patients with complex and high anal fistulas had CD (P=.0005). Females were more affected than males (P=.0005). CONCLUSION: Complex or high anal fistula on MR imaging may be the initial presentation of CD and warrant further work up to establish the diagnosis.

Methods Patients with perianal fistulizing CD who underwent pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and abdominal computed tomography (CT) were retrospectively enrolled. We scored the fistulas in each patient's MRI images based on Van Assche's classification. The area and density of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) (at the third, fourth, and fifth lumbar (L3, L4, and L5) levels were measured by averaging five slices of measurements at each vertebral level in CT images, and areas were further standardized by the lumbar height 2 (height L1-5 ). The VAT/SAT ratio (VSR) and VAT/Total adipose tissue (VA/TA) index were calculated. Based on MRI scores, patients were divided into two groups with low and high activity, and their clinical, MRI features, and CT parameters were compared. We evaluated patients with follow-up MRI and compared the differences in clinical and radiological indicators among patients with different outcomes. Results Overall, 136 patients were included, 77 in the low-activity group and 59 in the high-activity group. Patients in the high activity group had lower subcutaneous adipose index (all levels, p  < 0.05) and visceral adipose index (L3 level, p  < 0.01), but higher SAT and VAT density (all levels, p  < 0.01), VSR (L5 level, p  = 0.07) and VA/TA index (L5 level, p  < 0.05).

      "abstract": "Aim: The present study aims to determine the rate of mucosal recovery and predictors of persistent mucosal damage after gluten free diet (GFD). Background: Celiac disease (CD) is a complex multi-systemic autoimmune disease triggered by exposure to dietary gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. There is still little evidence on the best method for assessing GFD adherence and mucosal recovery during treatment. Methods: The retrospective study included only adult patients (age≥18 years old), with biopsy-proven CD evaluated at a tertiary referral centre between 2016 and 2021. We performed a logistic regression analysis to identify factors associated with partial mucosal recovery (MR) after GFD. We included in the multivariate analysis parameters available at the time of CD diagnosis. Results: A total of 102 patients were enrolled, two thirds were females, median age of 39 years (yrs). The initial biopsy analysis showed different stages of villous atrophy (VA) in 79 (77.4%) cases, while in 23(22.5%) cases showed mild enteropathy (Marsh 1, 2). After at least 12 months of GFD, 26 (25.5%) patients had persistent VA despite good or excellent adherence to GFD. Younger patients (< 35yrs), who showed severe mucosal damage (Marsh 3c lesions) and who had increased anti-gliadin antibody (AGA) levels were at risk for failure to obtain mucosal recovery (MR). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that complete mucosal atrophy (P=0.007) and high AGA antibody levels (cutoff 129 U/ml, P=0.001) were independent risk factors for lack of mucosal improvement after at least 12 months of GFD. Interestingly, genotype, tTG-IgA antibody levels, or duration of GFD levels did not influence the occurrence of MR. Conclusion: Although AGA seropositivity has lost much of their diagnostic significance in recent years due to the introduction of the more sensitive and specific antibody tests, our study reported that patients aged < 35 yrs, who showed severe mucosal damage (Marsh 3c lesions) and who had increased AGA antibody levels at diagnosis were at risk for failure to obtain MR. The elevated AGA levels at diagnosis could be used as a prognostic tool for assessing MR.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the performance of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) methods for discriminating acute from chronic myocardial infarction (MI). Although T2-weighted CMR is thought to be accurate in differentiating acute from chronic MI, few studies have reported on diagnostic accuracy, and these generally compared extremes in infarct age (e.g., <1 week old vs. more than 6 months old) and did not evaluate other CMR methods that could be informative. A total of 221 CMR studies were performed at various time points after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in 117 consecutive patients without a history of MI or revascularization enrolled prospectively at 2 centers. Imaging markers of acute MI (<1 month) were T2 hyperintensity on double inversion recovery turbo spin echo (DIR-TSE) images, microvascular obstruction (MO) on delayed-enhancement CMR, and focally increased end-diastolic wall thickness (EDWT) on cine-CMR. The prevalence of T2-DIR-TSE hyperintensity decreased with infarct age but remained substantial up to 6 months post-MI. In contrast, the prevalence of both MO and increased EDWT dropped sharply after 1 month. T2-DIR-TSE sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for identifying acute MI were 88%, 66%, and 77% compared with 73%, 97%, and 85%, respectively, for the combination of MO or increased EDWT. On multivariable analysis, persistence of T2-hyperintensity in intermediate-age infarcts (1 to 6 months old) was predicted by larger infarct size, diabetes, and better T2-DIR-TSE image quality score. For infarct size ≥ 10% of the left ventricle, a simple algorithm incorporating all CMR components allowed classification of infarct age into 3 categories (<1 month old, 1 to 6 months old, and ≥ 6 months old) with 80% (95% confidence interval: 73% to 87%) accuracy. T2-DIR-TSE hyperintensity is specific for infarcts <6 months old, whereas MO and increased EDWT are specific for infarcts <1 month old. Incorporating multiple CMR markers of acute MI and their varied longevity leads to a more precise assessment of infarct age.",

Their interaction with stem cells (SCs), which naturally secrete regenerative factors, further enhances their therapeutic potential. In particular, the use of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and exosome-enriched mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) preparations has been explored for treating gastrointestinal (GI) fistulas associated with Crohn's disease (CD), a debilitating form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Preclinical studies, clinical trials, and systematic reviews have evaluated the safety and efficacy of these approaches, with ADSCs-commercially available as Darvadstrocel-emerging as one of the most promising options. While notable progress has been made in both experimental and clinical research, the overall effectiveness of exosomes and stem cell-based therapies is still an area of active investigation. Further studies are needed to develop optimized, innovative treatments with minimal adverse effects. Given the substantial morbidity and healthcare burden associated with IBD-related fistulas, there is a critical need to find cost-effective, accessible, and reliable therapeutic options and strategies. Critically, none of these innovations will reach patients without regulatory convergence or cost-effectiveness data. Exosome therapies still lack a dedicated approval pathway, and GMP-scale purification is still confined to a handful of facilities, driving prices beyond current reimbursement limits. Future phase III trials must therefore embed economic modeling and adopt composite end points that link molecular engagement to MRI-verified fistula healing and patient-reported outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Perianal fistulas can occur to up to one-third of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) leading to significant disabling disease and morbidity. Fistulising perianal CD treatment often necessitates a combined pharmacological and surgical approach. Anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy, particularly infliximab, has been shown to be very effective for both perianal and internal fistulising CD. Nevertheless, current data suggest that sustained remission and long-term complete fistula healing can be achieved in only 30% to 50% of patients. Moreover, these percentages refer mostly to clinical rather than deep remission, defined as endoscopic and radiologic remission, which is quickly emerging as the preferred goal of therapy. Unfortunately, the therapeutic options for perianal fistulising CD are still limited. As such, it would be of great value to be able to predict, and more importantly, prevent treatment failure in these patients by early and continued optimization of anti-TNF therapy. Similar to ulcerative colitis and luminal CD, recent data demonstrate that higher infliximab concentrations are associated with better clinical outcomes in patients with perianal fistulising CD. This suggests that therapeutic drug monitoring and a treat-to-trough therapeutic approach may emerge as the new standard of care for optimizing anti-TNF therapy in patients with perianal fistulising CD.",

All patients with PFCD treated in our tertiary center between 2000 and 2005 by infliximab in combination with seton placement and/or IS and evaluated by MRI before treatment were included in the study. Basal clinical and MRI characteristics were recorded. Response to treatment was evaluated after the infliximab induction regiment and at the end of the follow-up. Twenty-six patients were included and followed-up for an average 4.9 years. A complex fistula was present in 69% (18/26 patients) of cases and eight (8/26 patients) had an ano-vaginal fistula. After infliximab induction therapy, 13 patients (50%) achieved a complete clinical response. The initial clinical response was significantly associated with the absence of both, active intestinal disease (54% vs. 8%, P = 0.03) and active proctitis (77% vs. 23%, P = 0.01). No initial MRI characteristics were linked to the initial response. In multivariate analysis, only the presence of active proctitis was associated with the lack of response (P = 0.047). At the end of the follow-up, 42% of the patients remained in clinical remission. No clinical characteristics were associated to sustained response when among long-standing responders two exhibited a normal post-treatment MRI. An initial complete response of PFCD was observed in half of the patients after combined therapy including infliximab that decreased to 42% later on. Complete healing of fistulas on MRI was possible but unusual. The initial response seemed related to the absence of active intestinal disease, especially in the rectum, when the long-term response could not be predicted by the basal characteristics of patients.",

Despite recent drug developments, novel surgical interventions as well as multidisciplinary treatment approaches, the outcome is dismal, with >50% therapy failure rates. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) offer potential therapeutic benefits for treating fistulizing CD, due to the pro‐regenerative paracrine signals. However, a significant obstacle to clinical translation of EV‐based therapy is the rapid clearance and short half‐life of EVs in vivo. Here, an injectable, biodegradable nanofiber‐hydrogel composite (NHC) microgel matrix that serves as a carrier to deliver MSC‐derived EVs to a rat model of CD perianal fistula (PAF) is reported. It is found that EV‐loaded NHC (EV‐NHC) yields the best fistula healing when compared to other treatment arms. The MRI assessment reveals that the EV‐NHC reduces inflammation at the fistula site and promotes tissue healing. The enhanced therapeutic outcomes are contributed by extended local retention and sustained release of EVs by NHC. In addition, the EV‐NHC effectively reduces inflammation at the fistula site and promotes tissue healing and regeneration via macrophage polarization and neo‐vascularization. This EV‐NHC platform provides an off‐the‐shelf solution that facilitates its clinical translation.",

This study aimed to evaluate the association between IFX trough levels and radiological perianal fistula healing in pediatric patients with PFCD undergoing long-term IFX treatment. Methods The study included pediatric patients (aged <18 years) diagnosed with PFCD who received IFX treatment and underwent follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 1 year. The primary outcome was radiological fistula healing on MRI one year after IFX treatment. Results A total of 82 patients were included and 57 (69.5%) achieved radiological fistula healing at the 1-year follow-up. Patients with radiological fistula healing had lower rates of reoperation (p = 0.021), and higher median IFX trough levels at week 2 (median, 17.6 vs. 14.1 μg/ml), week 6 (11.79 vs. 7.11 μg/ml), week 30 (3.9 vs. 1.1 μg/ml), and week 54 (7.6 vs. 3.7 μg/ml) (p = 0.043, 0.003, 0.007 and <0.001, respectively) compared to those who had no fistula healing. In the multivariate analysis, higher median IFX trough levels at week 6 and week 54 remained significant factors associated with radiological fistula healing (p = 0.039 and 0.018, respectively). Optimal cut-off IFX trough levels for radiological fistula healing showing the highest area under curve (AUC) score was 9.7 μg/ml [AUC: 0.792, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.630–0.955; p = 0.005] for week 6, and 5.1 μg/ml (AUC, 0.848; 95% CI: 0.750–0.947; p < 0.001) for week 54.

      "abstract": "Perianal fistulizing Crohn’s disease is a challenging condition that affects up to 10% of patients at diagnosis, with prevalence increasing over time, often necessitating complex treatment strategies. Effective management requires early, aggressive combination therapy, typically incorporating antibiotics, immunomodulators, and anti-TNF agents—particularly infliximab—to control inflammation and promote fistula closure. Radiological closure, rather than clinical remission alone, is crucial for confirming fistula healing and guiding therapeutic decisions, as persistent fistula tracts may remain despite symptom relief. Optimizing anti-TNF levels and the duration of combination therapy further improves outcomes, with the goal of achieving sustained radiological remission.

The clinical data of patients and perianal fistula characteristics, were collected. The primary efficacy evaluation indicator is the clinical healing rate and MRI healing rate after treatment. The secondary efficacy indicators included the CDAI, PDAI, CRP, ESR, and FC. Additionally, the SES-CD and Van Assche score were utilized, along with Wexner incontinent score, to evaluate effectiveness prior to treatment and at 24 weeks post-treatment. The independent risk factors induced MRI healing after treatment were determined through multivariate analysis using binary logistic regression analysis.\n \n \n \n A total of 66 patients were included in this study. According to the Montreal classification, group A1, A2 and A3 consisted of 3 patients (4.5%), 59 patients (89.4%), and 4 patients (6.1%) respectively. In terms of disease location, 26 patients (39.4%) were classified as L1, 9 patients (13.6%) as L2, and 31 patients (47.0%) as L3. Additionally, 50 patients (75.8%) presented with B1 while the remaining 16 patients (24.2%) had B2. Four patients (6.1%) presented with simple anal fistulas, while complex anal fistulas were observed in 62 cases (93.9%). At 24-week follow-up, the clinical healing rate was 95.5% (63/66) with an average healing time of 8.58 ± 4.27 weeks. The MRI healing rate demonstrated a significant outcome of 68.2% (45/66). Additionally, there was a notable reduction in patients' CDAI and PDAI scores, as well as CRP, ESR, FC concentrations, Van Assche scores, SES-CD and Wexner scores at 24-week compared to baseline levels (p < 0.001). The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the presence of perianal abscess (OR = 0.05, 95%CI: 0.004~0.052, p = 0.014) and a high baseline Van Assche score (OR = 0.48, 95%CI: 0.252~0.901, p = 0.023) were identified as independent risk factors for MRI healing in patients with pfCD. Meanwhile, no instances of anal function problems were reported during the follow-up period.\n \n \n \n The combination of UST and surgical intervention demonstrates favorable short-term clinical efficacy and safety in the management of patients with pfCD. Notably, the presence of perianal abscess and a high Van Assche score independently contribute to the risk of incomplete MRI healing.\n \n \n",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Crohn's disease is a chronic, relapsing form of inflammatory bowel disease marked by severe gastrointestinal inflammation and a broad range of debilitating symptoms. Despite advances in medical treatments, achieving sustained remission remains challenging for many patients. This umbrella review aims to consolidate evidence from various systematic reviews to evaluate the efficacy and safety of stem cell therapies in treating Crohn's disease.<h4>Methods</h4>This review followed the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology and adhered to PRISMA guidelines. A literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library covered records up to 20 April 2024. Only systematic reviews and meta-analyses on stem cell therapy for Crohn's disease were considered. Data were extracted and analyzed for clinical efficacy indicators like remission induction and safety metrics, including adverse events and mortality rates.<h4>Results</h4>Sixteen systematic reviews were included, spanning studies conducted between 2009 and 2023. Stem cell therapy showed a pooled risk ratio (RR) of 1.299 (95% CI: 1.192-1.420) for clinical remission, indicating a 29.9% increased likelihood of remission compared to controls. The pooled RR for healing perianal Crohn's disease was 1.358 (95% CI: 1.13-1.631), suggesting a 35.8% increased likelihood of healing. A pooled RR of 1.481 (95% CI: 1.036-2.116) shows a 48.1% higher immediate fistula closure rate with stem cell therapy. For long-term outcomes, a RR of 1.422 (95% CI: 1.091-1.854) indicates a 42.2% increased likelihood of maintaining closure. However, stem cell therapy did not significantly impact Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) (RR: 1.154, 95% CI: 0.193-6.883) and Perianal Disease Activity Index (PDAI) scores (mean difference at 12 weeks: -0.505, 95% CI: -2.481 to 1.471; mean difference at 24 weeks: -0.338, 95% CI: -1.638 to 0.963). The safety profile was comparable to conventional therapies, with a pooled RR of 0.972 (95% CI: 0.739-1.278) for adverse events and 1.136 (95% CI: 0.821-1.572) for serious adverse events.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Stem cell therapy offers significant progress in treating Crohn's disease, particularly in complex cases, by improving fistula closure rates and suggesting potential as a supplementary therapy. Its safety profile aligns with conventional treatments, yet ongoing clinical trials are crucial to optimize its use. Continual research will enable healthcare providers to tailor more effective treatment strategies for this challenging condition.",

      "abstract": "With the recent acceptance of multiple treatment goals for inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD], it becomes increasingly important to accurately quantify the measurable concepts. These include patient-reported symptoms, intestinal damage, mucosal activity, transmural inflammation, and histologicl appearance, as well as quality of life, disability, and other patient-centred attributes. Standardised indices which show sufficient validity, reliability, and responsiveness to change are not only mandatory for implementing the treat to target approach but are also critical for assessing the effectiveness of emerging medications in clinical trial settings. Some concepts can be accurately assessed through the use of existing measurement tools used for adults [eg, capsule endoscopy, ultrasonic, endoscopic, and histological scoring] and others may be age specific. Although several paediatric indices and scales are well established (eg, IMPACT questionnaire, Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index [PCDAI], and Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index [PUCAI]), recent years have seen the development of newer indices for children, including the Mucosal Inflammation Noninvasive Index [MINI] to predict endoscopic healing in Crohn's disease, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] indices that measure inflammation (ie, the Paediatric Inflammatory Crohn's Magnetic Resonance Enterography Index [PICMI]) and perianal disease (ie, Paediatric MRI-based Perianal Crohn's Disease [PEMPAC]), and patient-reported outcome measures in ulcerative colitis [ie, TUMMY-UC], upper gastrointestinal inflammatory score [ie, UGI-SES-CD], simplified endoscopic mucosal assessment score for Crohn's disease [SEMA-CD], and the parent-completed IMPACT questionnaire [ie, IMPACT-III-P]. Despite these advances, quantifiable paediatric IBD-specific tools are still lacking for disability and fatigue. In this review, we provide a contemporary, clinically focused overview of the indices that a paediatric gastroenterologist can use to quantify disease status.",

Methods This retrospective study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of our institution, which waived the requirement for informed consent. Twenty-nine patients (19 boys and 10 girls; median age, 14 years [range, 8 to 18 years]) with 56 fistulas were examined. Each fistula’s thickness and abscess size were measured using both modalities, and treatment response was classified as positive or negative based on each modality. The concordance of the classifications was compared between TPUS and pelvic MRI. A receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used to evaluate the performance of TPUS. Results TPUS found 80.4% (45/56) of the fistulas. On MRI, 39 fistulas (70%) were classified as having positive treatment responses, and the remaining 17 as having no response. The agreement of the classifications between TPUS and MRI was moderate (κ=0.486; P<0.001; Spearman ρ=0.573; P<0.001). Based on the ROC analysis with the MRI findings as a reference to distinguish positive from negative treatment responses, TPUS exhibited sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of 63.3%, 93.3%, 95.0%, 56.0%, and 73.3%, respectively. Conclusion TPUS can be an appropriate adjuvant imaging modality for pelvic MRI to evaluate the treatment response of PACD in children when initial TPUS detects PACD with a location and imaging features comparable to those visualized on MRI.",

      "abstract": "\n \n \n Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) has previously shown benefit in treatment-refractory perianal fistulizing Crohn’s disease (PFCD). However, the biological mechanisms underlying therapy response remain poorly understood. In this prospective study, we aimed to assess the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of HBOT followed by surgical closure, while also investigating translational changes associated with HBOT.\n \n \n \n Patients with active PFCD refractory to 6 months of optimized medical therapy were included. After receiving a seton, patients started HBOT (40 sessions, 110 minutes each with 5-minute air breaks, 100% oxygen at 2.4 atmosphere). Half-way, at week 4, the seton was removed and surgical closure of the internal fistula opening was attempted. All patients continued stable dose of medical treatment during the study. Response was assessed clinically, by pelvic MRI and by patient-reported QoL. RNAseq data of surgical biopsies of the internal fistula opening were explored between patients after completion of HBOT and matched non-HBOT patients.\n \n \n \n Sixteen patients completed HBOT and all of them could undergo a technically successful surgical procedure at week 4 (See Table 1). Clinical remission (no draining fistula openings) was achieved in 43% (W9), 42% (W26) and 70% (W52), and PDAI remission (≤4) was achieved by 31% (W9), 58% (W26) and 70% (W52) (Figure 1). MRI remission (MAGNIFI-CD ≤6) was achieved by 42% (W26) and 57% (W52), and MRI healing (MAGNIFI-CD = 0) was achieved by 8% (W26) and 40% (W52). Quality of Life (CAFQOL) improved significantly with a mean improvement of 10.7 (SE 3.9) by W26 and 22.7 (SE 6.0) by W52. (S)AEs included one patient with a potential oxygen toxicity seizure without long term effects, and one patient reported claustrophobia, no new AEs were reported.\n Surgical biopsies obtained after HBOT displayed increased expression of cornification markers including CRNN, KRT4, KRT13 and SPRR2B. Pathway analysis confirmed biological activity of ‘keratinization’ and ‘dermal development’ in post-HBOT samples. This is similar to those observed previously in cryptoglandular fistulas. In contrast, patients without HBOT on stable medical treatment mainly showed general immune activation.\n \n \n \n HBOT resulted in downstaging of active PFCD, which became amenable to surgical closure. The combined treatment approach resulted in sustained clinical and MRI remission in patients with refractory disease. HBOT resulted in enhanced activity of pathways associated with keratinization and dermal development. These data support a model where HBOT shifts an active Crohn’s disease fistula towards a more manageable cryptoglandular-like phenotype.\n \n \n",

      "abstract": "The Tailgut cyst (cystic hamartoma) is an uncommon congenital disease of presacral retrorectal space and is embryologically part of some forms of enteric cysts. It is a benign malformation, although cases have been described in neoplastic degeneration. A caucasian 24 year old female presented shortly after childbirth with hypogastric abdominal discomfort associated with rectal tenderness, bleeding and moderate urinary symptoms for about three weeks. No previous similar episodes were reported. The patient was not suffering from haemorrhoids or inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. Clinical examination revealed no significant abnormalities or in the perianal area and gluteal surface. Digital rectal examination was suspicious of the presence of a presacral retrorectal mass. However, it could not exclude a trans-sphinteric perianal fistula. There was no fistulous communication with the exterior and the pain seemed to be more pronounced in the rectum. MRI, which has a diagnostic accuracy of 76-100% for the detection of any perianal fistulae, was performed and demonstrated the presence of a retrorectal cystic hamartoma (Tailgut cyst). The most common retrorectal space cystic lesions includes epidermoid cysts, dermoid cysts and enteric cysts. It presents with pelvic pain, and sometimes with local abscess, secondary to a sinus cyst. There can also be a communication between Tailgut cyst and fistula; in the absence of primary infection may develop postinflammatory fibrosis. Radiological investigation is carried out by TRUS, CT and MRI. During MRI, on T1-weighted images, the signal intensity may change from hypointense to hyperintense as protein concentration increases, as well as in the case of bleeding. On T2-weighted images, signal intensity of mucinous fluids can decrease from highly hyperintense to hypointense with increasing protein concentration and viscosity. MRI is a non-invasive useful imaging investigation with high diagnostic accuracy when a retrorectal cyst is suspected. Despite its rarity, Tailgut cyst should be considered, both for acute complications, like infection or bleeding, and for the risk, however infrequent, of neoplastic degeneration.",

In addition, MRI can be used to evaluate the activity of fistulas, which is a significant factor for determining the therapeutic strategy. Objectives: This study aimed to determine the usefulness of diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI for assessing activity and visibility of perianal fistula. Patients and Methods: Fifty-three patients with 56 perianal fistulas were included in the current retrospective study. The T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and DWMRI were performed and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of fistulas were measured. Fistulas were classified into two groups: only perianal fistulas and fistulas accompanied by abscess. Fistulas were also classified into two groups, based on clinical findings: positive inflammatory activity (PIA) and negative inflammatory activity (NIA). Results: Mean ADC value (mm2/s) of PIA group was significantly lower than that of NIA group, regarding lesions in patients with abscess-associated fistulas (1.371 × 10-3 ± 0.168 × 10-3 vs. 1.586 × 10-3 ± 0.136 × 10-3; P = 0.036). No statistically significant difference was found in mean ADC values between PIA and NIA groups, in patients with only perianal fistulas (P = 0.507). Perianal fistula visibility was greater with combined evaluation of T2WI and DWMRI than with T2WI, for two reviewers (P = 0.046 and P = 0.014). Conclusion: The DWMRI is a useful technique for evaluating activity of fistulas with abscess. Perianal fistula visibility is greater with combined T2WI and DWMRI than T2WI alone.",

      "abstract": "A retrospective analysis was conducted to investigate how a bright luminal sign on high b-value diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) could be considered as a new biomarker for identifying fibrotic strictures in Crohn's disease (CD). Fibrotic strictures, due to excessive deposition of extracellular matrix following chronic inflammatory processes, can be difficult to distinguish from inflammatory strictures using endoscopy. This study was performed on 65 patients with CD who underwent MRE, and among them 32 patients showed the bright luminal sign on high b-value DWI. DWI findings were compared to pre- and post-contrast MRE data. Luminal bright sign performance results were calculated using a confusion matrix, the relationship between categorical variables was assessed by the χ2 test of independence, and the Kruskal-Wallis test (ANOVA) was used for the assessment of statistical significance of differences between groups. The results indicated a high sensitivity (90%) and specificity (85%) of the bright luminal sign for fibro-stenotic CD and a significant correlation between DWI luminal brightness and markers such as the homogeneous enhancement pattern (<i>p</i> < 0.001), increase in enhancement percentage from 70 s to 7 min after gadolinium injection (<i>p</i> < 0.001), and submucosal fat penetration (<i>p</i> = 0.05). These findings indicate that DWI hyperintensity can be considered as a good non-invasive indicator for the detection of severe intestinal fibrosis and may provide an efficient and accurate method for assessing fibrotic strictures. This new non-invasive biomarker could allow an early diagnosis of fibrotic stricture, delaying the onset of complications and subsequent surgery. Moreover, further evaluations through larger prospective trials with histopathological correlation are needed to confirm these results and completely determine the clinical benefits of DWI in treating CD.",

Two-hundred thirteen intestinal segments of 43 patients, who underwent colonoscopy within 2 weeks before or after MR enterography were evaluated in this retrospective study. DWI sequences, T2-weighted sequences, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences were acquired in the MR enterography scan after cleaning of the bowel and using an oral contrast agent. First, the intestinal segments that had active inflammation in MR enterography were qualitatively evaluated in T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences and then MR activity index (MRAI 1) and MRAI 2 were formed with and without contrast-enhanced sequences in 2 separate sessions. The correlation coefficient between contrast enhanced and DWI MR enterography scores (MRAI 1 and MRAI 2) of intestinal inflammation was 0.97 for all segments. In addition, separate correlation coefficients were calculated for terminal ileum, right colon, transverse colon, left colon, and rectum, and there was a strong correlation between the MRAI 1 and MRAI 2 scores of each segment (r = 0.86–0.97, P < .001). On the other hand, MR enterography had 88.7% sensitivity, 97.9% specificity, 95.5% positive predictive value, 94.6% negative predictive value, and 94.8% accuracy for detection of active inflammation in all intestinal segments in Crohn disease. DWI and T2-weighted sequences acquired with cleaning of the bowel can be used instead of contrast-enhanced MRI sequences for the evaluation of active inflammation in Crohn disease.",

      "abstract": "Guidelines on Crohn's perianal fistulas recommend anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) treatment and suggest considering surgical closure for patients with surgically amenable disease. However, long-term outcomes following these two strategies have not been directly compared. The aim of this study was to assess radiological healing in patients who received short-term anti-TNF treatment and surgical closure compared with those who received anti-TNF treatment alone. The PISA-II trial was a multicentre, patient preference study done in nine hospitals in the Netherlands and one hospital in Italy. Adult patients with Crohn's disease and an active high perianal fistula with a single internal opening were eligible for inclusion. After counselling, patients with no treatment preference were randomly assigned (1:1) using random block randomisation (block sizes of six without statification), to 4-month anti-TNF therapy and surgical closure or anti-TNF therapy for 1 year, after seton insertion. Patients with a treatment preference received their preferred therapy. The primary outcome was radiological healing assessed by MRI at 18 months, defined as a complete fibrotic tract or a MAGNIFI-CD (Magnetic Resonance Index for Fistula Imaging in Crohn's Disease) score of 0, assessed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Secondary outcomes included clinical closure, number of patients undergoing surgical reintervention and number of reinterventions, recurrences, and impact on quality of life measured by the Perianal Disease Activity Index (PDAI). Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis and additionally an as-treated analysis for radiological healing and clinical closure. This study was registered at the Dutch Trial Registry, NL7625, and with EudraCT, 2018-002064-15, and is closed to accrual due to completion. Between Sept 14, 2013, and Dec 7, 2019, 94 patients were enrolled onto the trial, of whom 32 (34%) were randomly assigned and 62 (66%) chose a specific treatment. 38 (40%) patients were assigned to the surgical closure group and 56 (60%) patients to the anti-TNF group. At 18 months, radiological healing was significantly more common in the surgical closure group (12 [32%] patients) than in the anti-TNF group (five [9%] patients; p=0·005). By contrast, clinical closure was not significantly different between the two treatment groups (26 [68%] patients in the surgical closure group vs 29 [52%] patients in the anti-TNF group; p=0·076). Significantly fewer patients required a reintervention in the surgical closure group than in the anti-TNF therapy group (five [13%] patients in the surgical closure group, median one reintervention [IQR one to three] vs 24 [43%] patients in the anti-TNF group, median two reinterventions [one to two]; p=0·005). Among patients who reached clinical closure during follow-up, four (14%) of 29 in the surgical closure group and five (16%) of 31 in the anti-TNF therapy group had a recurrence, which occurred only in patients without radiological healing. PDAI was significantly lower in the surgical closure group than in the anti-TNF group after 18 months (p=0·031). Adverse events and serious adverse events were similar in both treatment groups and mostly entailed reinterventions. Ten (11%) patients had side-effects associated with anti-TNF treatment. Two serious adverse events unrelated to study treatment occurred (appendicitis and myocardial infarction). One patient died from a tongue base carcinoma, unrelated to study treatment. Short-term anti-TNF treatment combined with surgical closure induces long-term MRI healing more frequently than anti-TNF therapy in patients with Crohn's perianal fistulas. These data suggest that patients with Crohn's perianal fistula amenable for surgical closure should be counselled for this therapeutic approach.

      "abstract": "Introduction Crohn’s disease is a chronic, complex inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. Among its most challenging complications are perianal fistulas. Aim This study aims to explore the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) in reducing the activity of perianal fistulas in Crohn’s disease patients. Material and methods This study enrolled patients diagnosed with Crohn’s disease-associated perianal fistulas, with a disease duration of at least 3 years. Participants underwent HBOT in conjunction with standard medical therapy. The therapeutic effects were assessed at predetermined intervals using the Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI), and laboratory parameters including faecal calprotectin levels, C-reactive protein (CRP) activity, serum iron concentration, and peripheral blood haemoglobin levels. Additionally, the Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn’s Disease (SESCD) and the Perianal Disease Activity Index (PDAI) were employed for evaluation. Results The adjunctive use of HBOT with conventional therapy yielded significant clinical improvements in patients with Crohn’s disease complicated by perianal fistulas. This was shown by an 81.8% improvement in CDAI scores and a 54.5% clinical remission rate, as determined by SESCD and PDAI. Notably, the beneficial effects of HBOT on SESCD, PDAI, and faecal calprotectin levels were statistically significant and persisted for 6 weeks post-HBOT, with sustained improvements observed in a follow-up assessment approximately 9 months after treatment. Conclusions The findings of this study suggest that HBOT may be a viable therapeutic adjunct in the management of complex cases of Crohn’s disease, particularly those with recurrent symptoms and limited responsiveness to conventional treatments. HBOT demonstrated potential in improving clinical outcomes and achieving remission rates exceeding 50%, indicating its promise as a treatment modality in this patient population.",

Combined remission, defined as clinical remission and absence of collections >2 cm confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging, was reported in 60.6% and in 69.7% of patients at months 6 and 12, respectively. The rate of patients with treatment failure, defined as no clinical remission at the last follow-up (mean 18.7 months; SD 9.9), was 34.5%. Failure rate was independent of follow-up time (p = 0.85). For effectiveness outcomes, between-study heterogeneity was negligible. Subgroup analysis indicated that none of the covariates modified the treatment effect. Pooled IRs per 100 patient-years of adverse events (AE), serious AEs, perianal abscesses, and reoperations were 19.6, 3.2, 16.9 and 7.1, respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Evidence from observational studies supports the efficacy and safety of darvadstrocel for complex perianal fistulas in CD.

We assessed neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in perianal fistulas and implicated their roles in pfCD healing.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients with complex pfCD who developed preplaced seton drainage were recruited during the verified maintenance of remission in CD. Fistula tracts were sampled during definitive surgery plus seton removal. Patient demographics, CD classification, medication strategy, and healing of pfCD were recorded. RNA sequencing was applied for transcriptomic profile analysis. NETs components, including myeloperoxidase (MPO), neutrophil elastase (NE), and citrullinated histone H3 (CitH3), were identified using immunofluorescence. Serum infliximab (IFX), anti-IFX antibodies, and tissue levels of IFX, adalimumab (ADA), MPO and CitH3 were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Peptidyl arginine deiminase IV (PAD4), tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and NE were detected using immunohistochemistry. Gene expression levels of PAD family members were assessed with qPCR.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwenty-one patients were included, 15 of whom adopted IFX as maintenance treatment. RNA-seq revealed difference in neutrophil associated pathways between unhealed and healed fistulas. NETs components (MPO/NE/CitH3) were detectable in the fistulas and were parallel with the PAD4 levels. Eleven of 21 (52%) patients experienced complete healing of the pfCD 108 weeks post-operatively. Fistula NETs were significantly increased in patients with unhealed pfCD. Increased NETs were associated with abundant TNF-α production and the absence of IFX in fistulas.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nNETs exist in pfCD fistulas, which are associated with unhealed post-operative fistulas in pfCD, suggesting their prognostic roles in pfCD.",

      "abstract": "Radiomics is an exciting new area of texture research for extracting quantitative and morphological characteristics of pathological tissue. However, to date, only single images have been used for texture analysis. We have extended radiomic texture methods to use multiparametric (mp) data to get more complete information from all the images. These mpRadiomic methods could potentially provide a platform for stratification of tumor grade as well as assessment of treatment response in brain tumors. In brain, multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) are based on contrast enhanced T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), T2WI, Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR), Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) and Perfusion Weighted Imaging (PWI). Therefore, we applied our multiparametric radiomic framework (mpRadiomic) on 24 patients with brain tumors (8 grade II and 16 grade IV). The mpRadiomic framework classified grade IV tumors from grade II tumors with a sensitivity and specificity of 93% and 100%, respectively, with an AUC of 0.95. For treatment response, the mpRadiomic framework classified pseudo-progression from true-progression with an AUC of 0.93. In conclusion, the mpRadiomic analysis was able to effectively capture the multiparametric brain MRI texture and could be used as potential biomarkers for distinguishing grade IV from grade II tumors as well as determining true-progression from pseudo-progression.",

The objective of the study was to fully automate liver MRE QC and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) using a deep learning (DL) method. In this retrospective, single center, IRB-approved human study, a curated dataset involved 897 MRE magnitude slices from 146 2D MRE scans [1.5 T and 3 T MRI, 2D Gradient Echo (GRE), and 2D Spin Echo-Echo Planar Imaging (SE-EPI)] of 69 patients (37 males, mean age 51.6 years). A SqueezeNet-based binary QC model was trained using combined and individual inputs of MRE magnitude slices and their 2D Fast-Fourier transforms to detect artifacts from patient motion, aliasing, and blurring. Three independent observers labeled MRE magnitude images as 0 (non-diagnostic quality) or 1 (diagnostic quality) to create a reference standard. A 2D U-Net segmentation model was trained on diagnostic slices with liver masks to support LSM. Intersection over union between the predicted segmentation and confidence masks identified measurable areas for LSM on elastograms. Cohen's unweighted Kappa coefficient, mean LSM error (%), and intra-class correlation coefficient were calculated to compare the DL-assisted approach with the observers' annotations. An efficiency analysis compared the DL-assisted vs manual LSM durations. The top QC ensemble model (using MRE magnitude alone) achieved accuracy, precision, and recall of 0.958, 0.982, and 0.886, respectively. The mean LSM error between the DL-assisted approach and the reference standard was 1.9% ± 4.6%. DL-assisted approach completed LSM for 29 diagnostic slices in under 1 s, compared to 20 min manually. An automated DL-based classification of liver MRE diagnostic quality, liver segmentation, and LSM approach demonstrates a promising high performance, with potential for clinical adoption.",

A total of 4148 radiomics features were extracted from multiparametric MRI, including T2-weighted imaging, T1-weighted imaging, apparent diffusion coefficient, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging. The analysis of variance, correlation test, univariate logistic analysis, and a gradient-boosting decision tree were used for the dimension reduction.

Results: Among these 383 patients, the prevalence of MSI was 14.62% (56/383). The RSD value of logistic regression algorithm was the lowest (4.64%), followed by Bayes (5.44%) and KNN (5.45%), which was significantly better than that of SVM (19.11%) and tree (11.94%) algorithms. The radiomics model based on logistic regression algorithm performed best, with AUCs of 0.827 and 0.739 in the training and test sets, respectively.

Endpoints included clinical healing and radiologic remission in those with clinically active fistulas, and relapse in those with healed fistulas.<h4>Results</h4>At baseline, 52% (n = 31) and 48% (n = 29) had clinically active and healed fistulas, respectively. For patients with clinically active fistulas, 71% achieved clinical healing after 22 months, with estimated healing rates of 39% and 84% at 1 and 2 years, respectively. Radiologic remission was achieved in 25%, significantly higher than baseline inclusion rates of 6%. For patients with healed fistulas, 7% experienced clinical relapse after 23 months, with no significant change in radiologic remission, 80% versus 86% at baseline.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A protocolized treatment strategy proactively optimizing care resulted in high rates of clinical healing and improved radiologic remission of Crohn's perianal fistulas. Controlled-matched studies are needed.",

It follows a relapse-remission pattern, making disease activity assessment crucial for treatment. Our study aims to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of various imaging modalities and to validate and compare the International Bowel Ultrasound Segmental Activity Score (IBUS-SAS), the multidetector computed tomography enterography score (MDCTEs), and the simplified endoscopic activity score for Crohn’s disease (SES-CD). We assessed diagnostic performance using the CD Activity Index (CDAI). We first categorized patients into remission and active groups. For those in the active stage, we further categorized them into mild/moderate and severe activity groups. We used Spearman rank correlation to evaluate the relationships among IBUS-SAS, bowel wall thickness (BWT), Color Doppler imaging signal (CDS), inflammatory fat (i-fat), bowel wall stratification (BWS), and clinical inflammatory indicators. A total of 103 CD patients were evaluated. The IBUS-SAS cut-off for remission and activity was 23.8, with an AUC of 0.923, sensitivity of 91.4%, and specificity of 84.8%. The SES-CD had an AUC of 0.801, sensitivity of 62.9%, and specificity of 84.4% at a cut-off of 4.5. The MDCTEs showed an AUC of 0.855, sensitivity of 77.1%, and specificity of 75.8% for a cut-off of 6.5. The Delong test revealed significant differences in diagnostic efficacy when comparing IBUS-SAS to SES-CD and IBUS-SAS to MDCTEs. In the group of mild or moderate-to-severe active, the IBUS-SAS had an AUC of 0.925, sensitivity of 83.7%, and specificity of 88.9% at a cut-off of 40. The SES-CD exhibited an AUC of 0.850, sensitivity of 90.7%, and specificity of 70.4% at a cut-off of 8.5. MDCTEs showed an AUC of 0.909, sensitivity of 83.7%, and specificity of 85.2% at a cut-off of 8.5. During Delong test, the IBUS-SAS, MDCTEs, and SES-CD showed no significant differences in assessing moderate-to-severe activity. Both IBUS-SAS and ultrasound parameters correlated with certain serum indicators (p < 0.05), although only weakly to moderately (all r < 0.5). The IBUS-SAS, MDCTEs and SES-CD can evaluate disease remission/active and mild/moderate-to-severe active in CD, and IBUS-SAS offers the potential to precisely define CD activity. Evaluation of imaging techniques (IBUS-SAS, MDCTEs, and SES-CD) for accurate diagnosis of Crohn’s disease (CD) activity. Diagnostic accuracy assessed using ROC curves, with Delong test and Spearman correlation analysis for efficacy and relationships. IBUS-SAS demonstrates high accuracy, while MDCTEs and SES-CD showed promising performance in assessing CD activity. First comparative analysis of IBUS-SAS, MDCTEs, and SES-CD in CD activity diagnosis, providing valuable clinical insights. Significance: Guiding selection of optimal imaging techniques for CD treatment decisions, improving early diagnosis and management strategies.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In preparation for upcoming clinical trials involving patients with Crohn’s disease (CD), we examine the validity, reliability and usability of the Crohn’s Disease-Health Index (CD-HI). The CD-HI is a multifaceted, disease-specific patient reported outcome measure (PROM) designed to measure CD symptomatic disease burden during clinical trials. As promising therapeutic interventions are being tested among CD patients, there is a clear need for researchers to have access to a valid, sensitive, and reliable patient reported outcome tool to track disease burden. This research describes the development and validation of the CD-HI as an efficient mechanism to quantify how CD patients both feel and function. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured, qualitative interviews with CD patients to identify potential symptoms of importance in CD. We then conducted a large, cross-sectional survey study with CD patients to identify the prevalence and importance of symptoms identified during the prior interviews. Symptom questions in the first version of the CD-HI were selected based on overall frequency and impact in a large population of CD patients, generalizability, and potential to respond to therapeutic intervention. Questions which measured a similar concept were grouped into subscales using factor analysis. The first version of the CD-HI was beta tested to explore the usability and relevance of the instrument to patients. We then performed test-retest reliability of each question and subscale. Lastly, we determined the internal consistency for each subscale and the overall instrument. The CD-HI is now finalized and available for use in upcoming clinical trials. RESULTS: Sixteen adults with CD participated in semi-structured qualitative interviews, providing 792 quotes regarding the symptomatic burden of CD. Four hundred and three adults with CD completed an online survey to determine the prevalence and relative importance of 148 patient identified symptoms. Questions were selected for the CD-HI based on their prevalence and relative importance to CD patients. Sixteen adults with CD participated in beta interview testing to address the usability and relevance of the instrument. Patients found the CD-HI to be clear, highly relevant, and easy to use. Test-retest reliability was conducted with twenty-three adults with CD, where participants completed the CD-HI at baseline and fourteen days later. One question was removed to optimize the overall reliability of the instrument. The final version of the CD-HI contains subscales that measure the following granular areas of CD health: 1) fatigue; 2) dietary restrictions; 3) gastrointestinal health; 4) sleep and daytime sleepiness; 5) bowel and bladder function; 6) emotional health; 7) joint health; 8) pain; 9) neck and back health; 10) activity participation; 11) social health; and 12) skin health. Total CD disease burden is measured using a weighted composite of these subscale scores. CONCLUSION: This research successfully demonstrates the ability of the CD-HI to report valid, reliable, and patient-relevant data as a disease-specific PROM. The CD-HI provides researchers and clinicians with an optimal mechanism to record relevant changes in CD health using the patient’s perspective.",

      "abstract": "\n \n \n MR enterography (MRE) accurately detects Crohn’s disease (CD) strictures, yet its ability to differentiate inflammatory from fibrostenotic components within a CD stricture is limited. Artificial intelligence in cross sectional imaging, termed radiomics, is a quantitative image extraction analysis technology creating an opportunity to enhance characterization of strictures on routine MRE exams. We present a study on machine-reader evaluation of MRE to distinguish inflammation and fibrosis in CD strictures via quantitative radiomic features and compare radiomics performance to central radiologist scoring of MRE.\n \n \n \n In this retrospective single center study 51 patients (n=34 for discovery; n=17 for validation) had confirmed stricturing CD (using CONSTRICT criteria) on MRE. Surgical histopathology scoring of specimens within 15 weeks of MRE exam (range 0-100, scores ≥70 =severe) was used as the reference standard for both inflammation and fibrosis. An expert abdominal radiologist blinded to clinical and histopathologic results provided a global visual analog scale (VAS, 0-100) assessment of stricture inflammation and fibrosis. 2164 3D radiomic features were extracted from the stricture regions on MRE, from which the most relevant feature subsets were identified via cross-validated machine learning analysis in the discovery cohort for differentiating between severe vs mild inflammation and fibrosis. Radiomic features and VAS scores were evaluated against pathology-defined inflammation and fibrosis in the validation cohort.\n \n \n \n Clinical variables including sex, age, Montreal classification and stricture type across discovery and validation groups can be found in Table 1. The median time from MRE to surgical resection was 7.1 90-15) weeks. 43% of strictures in the overall cohort were classified as severe for inflammation and 43% had severe fibrosis. Two distinct sets of radiomic features capturing textural heterogeneity (patterns, local entropy) within strictures were significantly associated with severe inflammation or severe fibrosis (p<0.01). For inflammation, AUC for discovery and validation were 0.69 and 0.67, respectively (Figure 1). For fibrosis, AUC for discovery and validation were 0.83 and 0.77, respectively (Figure 2). The radiologist VAS had an AUC of 0.71 for identifying inflammation and AUC 0.46 for identifying fibrosis. Combining radiomic features and radiologist VAS had no significant impact on predictor performance.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Radiomic analysis may support the identification of fibrosis, but not inflammation in stricturing CD compared to radiological visual assessment. This tool may offer a novel way to stratify patients for future anti-fibrotic therapies.\n",

      "abstract": "Up to 50% of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) experience secondary loss of response (SLR) to infliximab. Patients with SLR may show clinical signs of iron deficiency as a result of inflammation despite being iron-replete. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based radiomic index, R2*, can detect changes in iron metabolism. Therefore, the R2* parameter has considerable potential for detection of SLR to infliximab. The aims of this study were to explore the correlation between R2* and inflammation and to develop a non-invasive nomogram based on R2* to identify SLR to infliximab in patients with CD. Three hundred and twenty-two infliximab-treated patients with CD who underwent magnetic resonance enterography within 2 weeks before or after 54 weeks of infliximab therapy were divided into training and validation datasets at a ratio of 8:2. Point-biserial analysis was conducted to confirm the relationship between R2* and inflammation. A multivariate logistic regression model was created using R2*, CRP and hemoglobin (OR, 1.10, 1.04 and 0.98; P < 0.05). Receiver-operating characteristic curves and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test were used to assess the performance of the model. A correlation between R2* and inflammation was identified. Different trends in R2* and iron status indices were observed between patients with responsive and non-responsive CD, which is worthy of further study. The model was converted to a visualized nomogram that had a good ability to discriminate the outcomes of infliximab therapy with an area under the curve of 0.723 (95% CI, 0.661–0.785) in the training dataset and 0.715 (95% CI, 0.587–0.843) in the validation dataset. We confirmed a correlation between R2* and inflammation in patients with CD. Based on the MRI-based radiomic signature, a novel nomogram was established and validated to facilitate individualized identification of SLR to infliximab in patients with CD.",

This study aimed to assess the long-term outcomes in patients with pCD treated with autologous PRS injection.<h4>Methods</h4>Adult patients with therapy-refractory pCD (failure to anti-tumor necrosis factor [TNF] therapy and/or fistula surgery), who underwent fistula curettage, closure of the internal fistula orifice, and autologous PRS injection in a Dutch tertiary referral center were included in an earlier conducted pilot study (n = 25). The primary outcome was complete clinical closure at long-term follow-up (closure of all treated external opening[s]). Secondary outcomes were partial clinical closure (closure of ≥1 treated external opening[s]), radiologic healing (fibrotic fistula tract on magnetic resonance imaging), and recurrence.<h4>Results</h4>The majority of the patients were female (56%) (mean age 34.4 years [standard deviation - SD: 0.9], and mean follow-up 3.7 years [SD: 0.6]). The treatment-refractory character of the study cohort was displayed by the high rate of patients with ≥1 external opening (60%), prior exposure to an anti-TNF agent (92%), TOpClass classification system ≥ class 2b (36%), and the low rate of patients who underwent prior surgical interventions aimed at fistula closure (12%). During long-term follow-up, complete clinical closure was achieved in 88%. Partial clinical closure was achieved in all patients. Radiologic healing was achieved in 75% of the patients. Recurrence was reported in 8% of the patients who achieved prior clinical closure. No recurrences were observed in patients with radiologic healing. Seventeen unplanned re-interventions were reported in nine patients (36%), predominantly for residual fistulizing disease and in patients with severe therapy-refractory pCD (TOpClass classification system ≥ class 2b) at the time of inclusion.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Additional PRS injection, fistula curettage, and closure of the internal orifice is a promising therapy for patients with (treatment-refractory) pCD and could improve clinical and radiologic healing rates. In addition, low recurrence rates were observed. Future randomized research is warranted in order to assess the effectiveness and positioning of PRS in the field of pCD.<h4>Clinical trial registration</h4>NL8417.",

A non-probability consecutive sampling method was used to select participants, including all successive patients meeting the inclusion criteria. Sensitivity and specificity were evaluated to evaluate the diagnostic performance of MRI. Variables including patient characteristics, clinical traits, and imaging data were examined to uncover possible correlations with diagnostic accuracy. SPSS 21 software was used for statistical analysis. P-value <0.05 was considered significant.\nResults: Among the 49 study participants, MRI was able to detect perianal fistulas with a sensitivity of 92.3%. The level of specificity was high, at 90%. Diagnostic accuracy of MRI was 91.8% for the presence of abscesses and complex fistulous tracts.\nConclusion: Based on the positive overall diagnostic performance in this small sample, this research implies that MRI has the potential as a diagnostic tool for detecting perianal fistula. But the small sample size could have affected how statistically significant the results were. It is necessary to do more research with larger sample numbers to confirm these findings and assess the effect of variables, such as abscesses and intricate fistulous tracts, on the precision of MRI.",

Both intraindividual paired (n = 20) and independent group analyses (n = 13) were performed. Setons were categorized by configuration (O-shaped vs. V-shaped), thickness (1.5 mm vs. 2.5 mm), and laxity (≤ 2 cm vs. > 2 cm from the anal verge). Patient-reported outcomes were assessed using structured questionnaires evaluating sitting discomfort, discharge, sexual impact, and fecal incontinence.<h4>Results</h4>O-shaped setons caused significantly less sitting discomfort than V-shaped ones (50.0% vs. 80.0%, p = 0.021). Excess laxity (> 2 cm) was associated with increased discharge (86.4% vs. 51.6%, p = 0.008), sexual impact (42.1% vs. 10.3%, p = 0.016), and fecal incontinence (66.7% vs. 10.0%, p = 0.041). Thicker setons (2.5 mm) showed a non-significant trend toward more pain (42.9% vs. 17.9%, p = 0.080).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Seton configuration and laxity significantly affect patient comfort. O-shaped setons and shorter laxity (≤ 2 cm) are preferable for reducing discomfort.

      "abstract": "<h4>Purpose</h4>There is no consensus on the standard approach for trans-sphincteric perianal fistulas (TPAF) in the elderly population. The most commonly used sphincter-saving procedures are ligation of the inter-sphincteric fistula tract (LIFT) and mucosal advancement flap (MAF). We aimed to evaluate the incidence and risk factors for recurrence and incontinence in elderly patients with TPAF using both approaches.<h4>Methods</h4>This retrospective study included 257 patients who underwent LIFT (136 patients) or MAF (121 patients) for de novo and cryptoglandular TPAF between July 2018 and July 2021. Recurrent fistulas were clinically and radiologically detected using MRI. Postoperative incontinence was evaluated using the Wexner score and anorectal manometry. Logistic regression analysis was used to detect the risks of recurrence and incontinence.<h4>Results</h4>The median ages of the patients were 68 (64, 74) and 68 (65, 74) years in the LIFT and MAF groups, respectively. Higher recurrence rates were observed after LIFT (17 (12.5%)) than after MAF (13 (10.7%)), but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.662). Postoperative incontinence was observed in 18 patients (13.2%) and seven patients (5.8%) in the LIFT and MAF groups, respectively (P = 0.044). The predictors for fistula recurrence were smoking (OR, 75.52; 95% CI, 1.02 to 5611.35; P = 0.049), length of tract (OR, 17.3; 95% CI, 1.49 to 201.13; P = 0.023), and CD classification (OR, 7.08; 95% CI, 1.51 to 33.14; P = 0.013). A low Charlson comorbidity index score (≤ 5) (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.99; P = 0.046) and high postoperative mean squeeze anal pressure (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95 to 0.99; P = 0.001) were significant factors associated with reduced risk of incontinence. In particular, LIFT was associated with a significantly higher risk of incontinence than MAF (OR, 2.089; 95% CI, 1.006 to 4.33; P = 0.04).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The healing rates of MAF and LIFT procedures did not differ significantly; however, continence was significantly better after MAF. MAF should be added to the guidelines as a good option for the treatment of TPAF in elderly patients.<h4>Trial registration</h4>The study was registered as a clinical trial www.<h4>Clinicaltrials</h4>gov (NCT06616662).",

It is underrecognized, particularly if asymptomatic, which has led to varied reported incidences (10-60%). Earlier detection by pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (pMR) may alter management and outcomes. Aims If performing pMR on newly diagnosed pediatric CD patients identifies asymptomatic perianal CD and leads to earlier biologic use, fewer hospitalizations, and less surgery. Methods New CD patients were prospectively enrolled into the Edmonton Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Clinic (EPIC) registry. This clinic has done baseline pMR since 2018. A retrospective review (2018-2023) collected pMR, perianal exam, symptoms, blood work, calprotectin, medications, and surgeries (perianal and intestinal). A blinded radiologist re-read pMRs using St. James and Parks criteria. Statistics included descriptive, Fisher’s exact test, multivariate logistic regression, and survival analysis. Results 139 patients were included (63% male, median age 13 [IQR 11-16]). Ninety-six patients (69%) had no pMR perianal disease (pMR-), despite 13/96 (14%) having perianal symptoms and 26/96 (27%) with inflamed (n=6)/ non-inflamed (n=14) tags or fissures (n=6). Of the 43 (31%) with pMR+ perianal disease, 27/43 (63%) were asymptomatic (ASx) and 17/43 (40%) had a normal exam. pMR+/ASx patients with perianal exam findings included inflamed (n=4)/ non-inflamed (n=5) tags, fissures (n=1), and draining fistula (n=1). pMR+/Sx had higher Parks and St James scores compared to pMR+/ASx. Compared to pMR-, pMR+/ASx and pMR+/Sx patients had a relative risk of 1.40 [95% CI 1.16-1.71] and 1.72 [95% CI 1.72-1.73] of requiring a biologic at 6 months, and a relative risk of 1.39 [95% CI 1.23-1.62] and 1.45 [95% CI 1.45-1.46] of requiring a biologic at 1 year. pMR+/Sx patients had an increased probability of CD surgery (p<0.002) but not hospitalization (p>0.05). There were no differences between pMR+/ASx and pMR- patients in surgery or hospitalization (p>0.05). Time to surgery was shorter in pMR+/Sx (p<0.01), but not different between pMR+/ASx and pMR- (p>0.05). Conclusions The majority of patients with perianal CD identified on pMR had no perianal symptoms and had a normal exam. This early identification of subclinical perianal disease led to increased and earlier biologic use, which may explain the lack of increased hospitalization and surgical rates compared to those without pMR+ perianal disease. Baseline imaging was also helpful for demonstrating the absence of deeper perianal disease in several patients who did have perianal symptoms and tags/fissures.

      "abstract": "Acute myocardial infarct (AMI) size depicted by late gadolinium enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is increasingly used as an efficacy endpoint in randomized trials comparing AMI therapies. Infarct size is quantified using manual planimetry (MANUAL), visual scoring (VISUAL), or automated techniques using signal-intensity thresholding (AUTO). Although AUTO is considered the most reproducible, prior studies did not account for the subjective determination of endocardial/epicardial borders, which all methods require. For MANUAL and VISUAL, prior studies did not address how to treat intermediate signal intensities due to partial volume. To assess sources of variability, AMI size was measured in 30 patients and 12 controls by 3 core-laboratories using 8 methods, each separated by more than 2 months time (n = 720 evaluations). The methods were: (1,2) AUTO<sub>Segment</sub>, AUTO<sub>FWHM</sub> (using Segment software or the full-width-at-half-maximum algorithm, respectively); (3,4) AUTO-UC<sub>Segment</sub>, AUTO-UC<sub>FWHM</sub> (user correction for endocardial border pixels, no-reflow, etc.); (5) MANUAL; (6) MANUAL-ISI (adjustment for intermediate signal-intensities); (7) VISUAL; (8) VISUAL-ISI. Mean infarct size varied between 16.8% and 27.2% of LV mass depending on method. Even automated techniques with no user interaction for infarct borders resulted in significant within-patient variability given the need to subjectively trace endocardial/epicardial contours. The coefficient-of-variation (CV) was 10.6% and 14.6% for AUTO<sub>Segment</sub> and AUTO<sub>FWHM</sub>, respectively. For manual and visual categories, reproducibility was improved when intermediate signal-intensities were considered (MANUAL-ISI vs MANUAL: CV = 8.3% vs 14.4%; p = 0.03; VISUAL-ISI vs VISUAL: CV = 8.4% vs 10.9%; p = 0.01). For AUTO-UC<sub>Segment</sub>, MANUAL-ISI, and VISUAL-ISI (best technique in each category) within-patient variability due to the quantification method was less than 10% of total variability, and the required sample sizes for detecting a 5% absolute difference in infarct size were 62, 63, and 62 patients, respectively. Among CMR core-laboratories, an important source of variability in infarct size quantification is the subjective delineation of endocardial/epicardial borders. When intermediate signal intensities are considered in manual planimetry and visual scoring, reproducibility and impact on sample size are similar to automated techniques.",

      "abstract": "Both hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and Crohn disease (CD) are characterized by suppuration and granulomatous inflammation, which may result in formation of tunnels, sinus tracts, or fistulas. We sought to determine the differences in characteristics of fistulizing perianal CD vs. perianal HS on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This retrospective cohort study included patients diagnosed with CD, HS, or both diseases who underwent medical examination at the Mayo Clinic between January 1, 1998, and July 31, 2021. We further selected patients who had documented perianal lesions and underwent pelvic MRI. Two abdominal radiologists blinded to clinical diagnosis reviewed the MR images for the presence or absence of 10 characteristics. For characteristics that differed significantly between patients with CD and HS, odds ratios were calculated. A radiomics-based MRI scoring system was constructed according to the odds ratios and was validated. On MRI, significantly more patients in the HS group (n = 49) than the CD group (n = 74) had subcutaneous tunnels (35% vs. 4%; p < 0.001), soft-tissue inflammation of subcutaneous tissue and skin (35% vs. 5%; p < 0.001), and inguinal lymphadenopathy (65% vs. 45%; p = 0.02). Significantly more patients in the CD group than the HS group had transsphincteric fistula (64% vs. 35%; p = 0.002), intersphincteric fistula (58% vs. 29%; p = 0.001), mesorectal lymphadenopathy (26% vs. 4%; p = 0.002), and rectal inflammation (32% vs. 12%; p = 0.01). The proposed MRI scoring system for distinguishing HS from CD had a sensitivity of 0.77, specificity of 0.80, and area under the curve of 0.84. MRI may be a valuable tool in distinguishing perianal draining tunnels in HS from fistulizing perianal CD. The MRI scoring system we created could help in the clinical decision-making process. Combining MRI with other investigational and clinical findings may improve diagnostic accuracy for these challenging perianal diseases.",

Methods: The implementation involved modifying a few source code files to create a Pulseq interpreter for the Philips MRI system. Validation experiments were conducted using simulations and phantom scans performed on a 7T Achieva MRI system. The observed sequence and waveforms were compared to the intended ones, and the gradient waveforms produced by the scanner were verified using a field camera. Image reconstruction was performed using the raw k-space samples acquired from both the native vendor environment and the Pulseq interpreter.   Results: The reconstructed images obtained through the Pulseq implementation were found to be comparable to those obtained through the native implementation. The performance of the Pulseq interpreter was assessed by profiling the CPU utilization of the MRI spectrometer, showing minimal resource utilization for certain sequences.   Conclusion: The successful implementation of the Pulseq interpreter on the Philips MRI scanner demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing Pulseq sequences on Philips MRI scanners. This provides an open-source platform for MRI sequence development, facilitating collaboration among researchers and accelerating scientific progress in the field of MRI.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Perianal fistulas may affect 15% to 50% of patients with Crohn’s disease. Treatment is complex, requiring a multidisciplinary approach. Darvadstrocel (allogenic mesenchymal cells obtained from lipoaspirates) was approved in 2018 by the European and Spanish Agencies of Medicines and Medical Products as a treatment for fistulas in Crohn’s disease. Recent guidelines from the European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation and Spanish Working Group on Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis state that darvadstrocel is effective with a favorable safety profile and a strong level of evidence (n = 2). OBJECTIVE: Presenting real-world effectiveness data for darvadstrocel in a Spanish population. DESIGN: Observational retrospective cohort study with prospective data gathering. SETTINGS: The study was conducted at 14 institutions in Spain. PATIENTS: From November 2019 to April 2022, all patients (n = 73) treated with darvadstrocel in these institutions were included, fulfilling the following criteria: 1) complex fistula/s in a patient with Crohn’s disease; 2) failure of conventional and antitumor necrosis factor treatment; and 3) the absence of collections of >2 cm confirmed by pelvic MRI at the time of surgery. INTERVENTIONS: Darvadstrocel treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical response (closure of 50% or more of external openings), complete clinical closure (100% of external openings), and radiological closure (no fluid collection >2 cm, edema, or inflammation) evaluated 6 months after treatment. RESULTS: Clinical response was observed in 63 patients (86.3%), complete clinical closure in 50 patients (68.5%), and radiological closure in 45 patients (69.2%). Combined clinical and radiological response was observed in 41 patients (63.1%). Not all clinically healed patients had radiological closure, and vice versa. No serious adverse events were reported. LIMITATIONS: Retrospective nature of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Study results were consistent with those reported in previous clinical trials, real-world efficacy findings from the INSPIRE study (assessing darvadstrocel effectiveness in Europe, Israel, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and Japan), and previously published literature. Darvadstrocel was effective and demonstrated a favorable safety profile when used in normal clinical practice for the treatment of fistulas in Crohn’s disease. See Video Abstract.

      "abstract": "\n \n \n Perianal Crohn’s Disease (PCD) remains a refractory phenotype of Crohn’s Disease (CD)1. Despite initial demonstration of the benefit of infliximab (IFX) in PCD over 20 years ago2, it remains clear how IFX treatment can be optimised for PCD patients3. In this retrospective observational study, a cohort of PCD patients based at St Mark’s Hospital was reviewed to understand their disease-journeys whilst on treatment with IFX.\n \n \n \n A cohort of 59 patients with PCD on treatment with IFX as of January 2020 were identified from a prospective database of IFX treated patients. Twenty-seven patients were classed as fluctuating IFX levels and underwent disease-journey analysis. Detailed qualitative analysis of individual patients journeys were carried out to correlate IFX levels, where available, to C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Examinations Under Anaesthetic (EUA). These journeys were then graphed as a timeline for each of these patients.\n \n \n \n Four disease-journeys have been selected to exemplify key learning points in the management of PCD.\n Graph 1: Improving drainage and reducing inflammatory burden with EUA can help to recover IFX levels and regain disease control. This suggests a well-timed EUA can have a synergistic effect on treatment with IFX.\n \n Graph 2: In a subgroup of patients, optimised medical therapy with IFX alone remains adequate to perianal fistula healing.\n \n Graph 3: Patients may benefit from temporary dose escalations with IFX to recapture response and to improve disease burden.\n \n Graph 4: Some patients require longer periods of dose-escalated therapy as seen in this graph & higher IFX levels may be required for radiological healing.\n \n \n \n \n These cases highlight interesting learning points and can help to manage complicated PCD patients. Further work is needed to determine how significant the link is between improvement in IFX levels post-EUA and how this correlates with the overall clinical picture of the patient.\n \n \n \n 1.

      "doi": "",
      "abstract": "T2 hyperintensities in spinal cord MR images are crucial biomarkers for conditions such as degenerative cervical myelopathy. However, current clinical diagnoses primarily rely on manual evaluation. Deep learning methods have shown promise in lesion detection, but most supervised approaches are heavily dependent on large, annotated datasets. Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) offers a compelling alternative by eliminating the need for abnormal data annotations. However, existing UAD methods rely on curated normal datasets and their performance frequently deteriorates when applied to clinical datasets due to domain shifts. We propose an Uncertainty-based Unsupervised Anomaly Detection framework, termed U2AD, to address these limitations. Unlike traditional methods, U2AD is designed to be trained and tested within the same clinical dataset, following a \"mask-and-reconstruction\" paradigm built on a Vision Transformer-based architecture. We introduce an uncertainty-guided masking strategy to resolve task conflicts between normal reconstruction and anomaly detection to achieve an optimal balance. Specifically, we employ a Monte-Carlo sampling technique to estimate reconstruction uncertainty mappings during training. By iteratively optimizing reconstruction training under the guidance of both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, U2AD reduces overall reconstruction variance while emphasizing regions. Experimental results demonstrate that U2AD outperforms existing supervised and unsupervised methods in patient-level identification and segment-level localization tasks. This framework establishes a new benchmark for incorporating uncertainty guidance into UAD, highlighting its clinical utility in addressing domain shifts and task conflicts in medical image anomaly detection.

We conducted a retrospective study of patients receiving ustekinumab across eight Scottish National Health Service health boards between 2017 and 2019. Inclusion criteria included a diagnosis of Crohn's disease with symptoms attributed to active disease plus objective signs of inflammation at baseline (C-reactive protein ≥ 5 mg/L or fecal calprotectin ≥ 250 μg/g or inflammation on endoscopy/magnetic resonance imaging) and completion of induction plus at least one clinical follow-up at 8 weeks. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to establish 12-month cumulative rates of clinical remission, mucosal healing, deep remission, and perianal fistula response. Rates of serious adverse events were described quantitatively. Our cohort consisted of 216 patients (female sex, 37.9%; median age, 39.0 years, interquartile range [IQR] 28.8-51.8 years; disease duration, 9.9 years, IQR 6.0-16.5 years; prior biologic, 98.6%) with a median follow-up of 35.0 weeks (IQR 17.4-52.0 weeks). Twelve-month cumulative rates of clinical remission, mucosal healing, and deep remission (clinical remission plus mucosal healing) were 32.0%, 32.7%, and 19.3%, respectively. In patients with active perianal disease (n = 37), the 12-month cumulative perianal response rate was 53.1%. The serious adverse event rate was 13.6 per 100 patient-years of follow-up.

      "abstract": "Accurately detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD) and predicting mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score are important tasks in elderly health by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Most of the previous methods on these two tasks are based on single-task learning and rarely consider the correlation between them. Since the MMSE score, which is an important basis for AD diagnosis, can also reflect the progress of cognitive impairment, some studies have begun to apply multi-task learning methods to these two tasks. However, how to exploit feature correlation remains a challenging problem for these methods. To comprehensively address this challenge, we propose a MRI-based multi-task decoupled learning method for AD detection and MMSE score prediction. First, a multi-task learning network is proposed to implement AD detection and MMSE score prediction, which exploits feature correlation by adding three multi-task interaction layers between the backbones of the two tasks. Each multi-task interaction layer contains two feature decoupling modules and one feature interaction module. Furthermore, to enhance the generalization between tasks of the features selected by the feature decoupling module, we propose the feature consistency loss constrained feature decoupling module. Finally, in order to exploit the specific distribution information of MMSE score in different groups, a distribution loss is proposed to further enhance the model performance. We evaluate our proposed method on multi-site datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed multi-task decoupled representation learning method achieves good performance, outperforming single-task learning and other existing state-of-the-art methods.",

      "doi": "10.3174/ajnr.A8173",
      "pmid": "38423747",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Spontaneous intracranial hypotension is an increasingly recognized condition. Spontaneous intracranial hypotension is caused by a CSF leak, which is commonly related to a CSF-venous fistula. In patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension, multiple intracranial abnormalities can be observed on brain MR imaging, including dural enhancement, “brain sag,” and pituitary engorgement. This study seeks to create a deep learning model for the accurate diagnosis of CSF-venous fistulas via brain MR imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review of patients with clinically suspected spontaneous intracranial hypotension who underwent digital subtraction myelogram imaging preceded by brain MR imaging was performed. The patients were categorized as having a definite CSF-venous fistula, no fistula, or indeterminate findings on a digital subtraction myelogram. The data set was split into 5 folds at the patient level and stratified by label. A 5-fold cross-validation was then used to evaluate the reliability of the model. The predictive value of the model to identify patients with a CSF leak was assessed by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for each validation fold. RESULTS: There were 129 patients were included in this study. The median age was 54 years, and 66 (51.2%) had a CSF-venous fistula. In discriminating between positive and negative cases for CSF-venous fistulas, the classifier demonstrated an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.8668 with a standard deviation of 0.0254 across the folds. CONCLUSIONS: This study developed a deep learning model that can predict the presence of a spinal CSF-venous fistula based on brain MR imaging in patients with suspected spontaneous intracranial hypotension. However, further model refinement and external validation are necessary before clinical adoption. This research highlights the substantial potential of deep learning in diagnosing CSF-venous fistulas by using brain MR imaging.",

      "abstract": "\n \n \n Ileocecal resection (ICR) is a common procedure in Crohn’s disease (CD). Increasing evidence suggests ICR may be considered a first-line treatment for localized ileal CD to maintain long-term remission, rather than starting biologics. However, removal of the ileocecal valve affects bowel transit and disabling symptoms may arise. The aim of our study was to prospectively assess the impact of primary ICR on daily digestive symptoms in CD patients.\n \n \n \n We included patients who underwent primary ICR at Saint-Antoine Hospital between January 2017 and December 2022. Patients were assessed after a morphological evaluation (endoscopy or MRI) performed between 5 months and 1 year post-ICR. Digestive symptoms were prospectively and systematically collected using a dedicated database. The primary endpoint was the prevalence of a composite outcome, defined as at least 4 soft or liquid stools per day and/or a fecal urgency with inability to delay defecation for more than 15 minutes, and/or moderate to severe daily abdominal pain. Secondary endpoints included other digestive symptoms. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to assess predictive factors for the primary outcome.\n \n \n \n One hundred nine patients were included. Indications for ICR were fistulizing disease (n=61, 56%) and stenosis (n=41, 37.6%). Only 7 patients (6.4%) had surgery for uncomplicated inflammatory disease. Thirty-five patients (32.1%) had morphological recurrence, defined as i2b, i3, i4 score, deep ulcers, stenosis, or fistulas on MRI. The primary endpoint was met by 24 patients (22%), with 21.1% having at least 3 liquid stools per day. Diarrhea (soft to liquid stools daily) was observed in 56.9%, fecal urgency in 22.9%, and abdominal pain in 32.1% (Figure 1). The primary endpoint prevalence was 17.6% in patients without morphological recurrence and 31.4% in those with recurrence (p=0.17) (Table 1). Multivariate analysis showed that age >40 years at surgery (OR=3.58 [95%CI 1.06-12.8] p=0.04), disease duration >2 years (OR=5.67 [95%CI 1.69-23.0] p=0.008), sepsis (fever >38.3°C within 7 days before surgery) (OR=8.06 [95%CI 1.68-44.2] p=0.01), and small bowel resection length >40 cm (OR=9.50 [95%CI 2.35-45.8] p=0.003) were associated with poorer digestive quality of life as defined by the primary composite endpoint.\n \n \n \n The prevalence of digestive symptoms after primary ICR for CD is notable, regardless of disease recurrence. Advanced age, long disease duration, sepsis at surgery, and resection length were associated with disabling digestive symptoms. These results suggest that ICR leads to frequent and disabling digestive symptoms for many patients, which should be considered when proposing ICR.\n \n \n",

We determined prevalence of PAF CD in the United States and compared costs and health care resource utilization (HRU) of PAF CD patients with matched non-PAF CD patients. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of claims data from the IBM MarketScan Commercial Database from October 1, 2015, to September 30, 2018. Eligible patients were aged 18 to 89 years with ≥2 CD diagnoses. Patients with PAF CD had ≥1 PAF diagnosis or procedure code and were matched with non-PAF CD patients. Cumulative prevalence of PAF CD in the US population was calculated across total patients in MarketScan. All-cause and gastrointestinal (GI)-related costs and HRU were compared between groups using a generalized linear model (GLM). Results Cumulative 3-year prevalence of PAF was 7.70% of patients with CD (N = 81,862) and 0.01% of the US population. Among PAF CD (n = 1218) and matched non-PAF CD (n = 4095) patients, most all-cause costs and HRU were GI-related. Mean total all-cause and GI-related health care costs per patient and per year for PAF CD were $85,233 and $71,612, respectively, vs $40,526 and $29,458 for non-PAF CD (P < .0001). Among PAF CD vs non-PAF CD patients, GLM-adjusted proportions of patients with GI-related inpatient, outpatient, or pharmacy visits, mean GI-related inpatient length of stay, and mean GI-related surgeries were higher (P < .0001 for all comparisons). Conclusions Costs and HRU are significantly higher for patients with PAF CD vs non-PAF CD patients, highlighting the economic burden of the disease.",

The elucidation of neural alterations may provide novel insights into its management. We aimed to develop a multiparameter brain MRI-based radiomics model (RM) for characterizing neural alterations in CD patients and to interpret these alterations using multiomics traits.<h4>Methods</h4>This prospective study enrolled 230 CD patients and 46 healthy controls (HCs). Participants voluntarily underwent brain MRI and psychological assessment (n = 155), blood metabolomics analysis (n = 260), and/or fecal 16S rRNA sequencing (n = 182). The RM was developed using 13 features selected from 13,870 first-order features extracted from multiparameter brain MRI in training cohort (CD, n = 75; HCs, n = 32) and validated in test cohort (CD, n = 34; HCs, n = 14). Multiomics data (including gut microbiomics, blood metabolomics, and brain radiomics) were compared between CD patients and HCs.<h4>Results</h4>In the training cohort, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of RM for distinguishing CD patients from HCs was 0.991 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.975-1.000). In test cohort, RM showed an AUC of 0.956 (95% CI, 0.881-1.000). CD-enriched blood metabolites such as triacylglycerol (TAG) exhibited significant correlations with both brain features detected by RM and CD-enriched microbiota (e.g., Veillonella). One notable correlation was found between Veillonella and Ctx-Lh-Middle-Temporal-CBF-p90 (r = 0.41). Mediation analysis further revealed that dysbiosis, such as of Veillonella, may regulate the blood flow in the middle temporal cortex through TAG.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We developed a multiparameter MRI-based RM that characterized the neural alterations of CD patients, and multiomics data offer potential evidence to support the validity of our model. Our study may offer clues to help provide potential therapeutic targets.<h4>Critical relevance statement</h4>Our brain-gut axis study developed a novel model using multiparameter MRI and radiomics to characterize brain changes in patients with Crohn's disease. We validated this model's effectiveness using multiomics data, making it a potential biomarker for better patient management.<h4>Key points</h4>Utilizing multiparametric MRI and radiomics techniques could unveil Crohn's disease's neurophenotype. The neurophenotype radiomics model is interpreted using multiomics data. This model may serve as a novel biomarker for Crohn's disease management.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) classification of myocardial scarring in cardiac MRI is often hindered by limited explainability, particularly with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To address this, we developed One Match (OM), an algorithm that builds on template matching to improve on both the explainability and performance of ML myocardial scaring classification. By incorporating OM, we aim to foster trust in AI models for medical diagnostics and demonstrate that improved interpretability does not have to compromise classification accuracy. Using a cardiac MRI dataset from 279 patients, this study evaluates One Match, which classifies myocardial scarring in images by matching each image to a set of labeled template images. It uses the highest correlation score from these matches for classification and is compared to a traditional sequential CNN. Enhancements such as autodidactic enhancement (AE) and patient-level classifications (PLCs) were applied to improve the predictive accuracy of both methods. Results are reported as follows: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-score. The highest classification performance was observed with the OM algorithm when enhanced by both AE and PLCs, 95.3% accuracy, 92.3% sensitivity, 96.7% specificity, 92.3% precision, and 92.3% F1-score, marking a significant improvement over the base configurations. AE alone had a positive impact on OM increasing accuracy from 89.0% to 93.2%, but decreased the accuracy of the CNN from 85.3% to 82.9%. In contrast, PLCs improved accuracy for both the CNN and OM, raising the CNN's accuracy by 4.2% and OM's by 7.4%. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of OM in classifying myocardial scars, particularly when enhanced with AE and PLCs. The interpretability of OM also enabled the examination of misclassifications, providing insights that could accelerate development and foster greater trust among clinical stakeholders.",

      "abstract": "Objective The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a nomogram combined multiparametric MRI and clinical indicators for identifying the WHO grade of meningioma. Materials and methods Five hundred and sixty-eight patients were included in this study, who were diagnosed pathologically as having meningiomas. Firstly, radiomics features were extracted from CE-T1, T2, and 1-cm-thick tumor-to-brain interface (BTI) images. Then, difference analysis and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator were orderly used to select the most representative features. Next, the support vector machine algorithm was conducted to predict the WHO grade of meningioma. Furthermore, a nomogram incorporated radiomics features and valuable clinical indicators was constructed by logistic regression. The performance of the nomogram was assessed by calibration and clinical effectiveness, as well as internal validation. Results Peritumoral edema volume and gender are independent risk factors for predicting meningioma grade. The multiparametric MRI features incorporating CE-T1, T2, and BTI features showed the higher performance for prediction of meningioma grade with a pooled AUC = 0.885 (95% CI, 0.821–0.946) and 0.860 (95% CI, 0.788–0.923) in the training and test groups, respectively. Then, a nomogram with a pooled AUC = 0.912 (95% CI, 0.876–0.961), combined radiomics score, peritumoral edema volume, and gender improved diagnostic performance compared to radiomics model or clinical model and showed good calibration as the true results. Moreover, decision curve analysis demonstrated satisfactory clinical effectiveness of the proposed nomogram. Conclusions A novel nomogram is simple yet effective in differentiating WHO grades of meningioma and thus can be used in patients with meningiomas. Clinical relevance statement We proposed a nomogram that included clinical indicators and multi-parameter radiomics features, which can accurately, objectively, and non-invasively differentiate WHO grading of meningioma and thus can be used in clinical work. Key Points • The study combined radiomics features and clinical indicators for objectively predicting the meningioma grade . • The model with CE-T1  +  T2  +  brain-to-tumor interface features demonstrated the best predictive performance by investigating seven different radiomics models . • The nomogram potentially has clinical applications in distinguishing high-grade and low-grade meningiomas .",

      "abstract": "Simple Summary The preoperative definition of the Oncotype DX recurrence score would be critical to identify breast cancer patients who could benefit from chemotherapy before surgery. In this work, we built a machine learning model applied to DCE-MRI images of a publicly available dataset to predict the Oncotype DX score in patients with breast cancer. As a result, the model achieved an accuracy of 60% in the training set and 63% (AUC = 0.66) in the test set. Our findings support the feasibility of radiomics and machine learning for the prediction of prognostic data in breast cancer, encouraging further, preferably multicenter, investigations to further improve the performance of the model and assess its generalizability. Abstract Aim: To non-invasively predict Oncotype DX recurrence scores (ODXRS) in patients with ER+ HER2- invasive breast cancer (IBC) using dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI-derived radiomics features extracted from primary tumor lesions and a ML algorithm. Materials and Methods: Pre-operative DCE-MRI of patients with IBC, no history of neoadjuvant therapy prior to MRI, and for which the ODXRS was available, were retrospectively selected from a public dataset. ODXRS was obtained on histological tumor samples and considered as positive if greater than 16 and 26 in patients aged under and over 50 years, respectively. Tumor lesions were manually annotated by three independent operators on DCE-MRI images through 3D ROIs positioning. Radiomic features were therefore extracted and selected using multistep feature selection process. A logistic regression ML classifier was then employed for the prediction of ODXRS. Results: 248 patients were included, of which 87 with positive ODXRS. 166 (66%) patients were grouped in the training set, while 82 (33%) in the test set. A total of 1288 features was extracted. Of these, 1244 were excluded as 771, 82 and 391 were excluded as not stable (n = 771), not variant (n = 82), and highly intercorrelated (n = 391), respectively. After the use of recursive feature elimination with logistic regression estimator and polynomial transformation, 92 features were finally selected. In the training set, the logistic regression classifier obtained an overall mean accuracy of 60%. In the test set, the accuracy of the ML classifier was 63%, with a sensitivity of 80%, specificity of 43%, and AUC of 66%. Conclusions: Radiomics and ML applied to pre-operative DCE-MRI in patients with IBC showed promises for the non-invasive prediction of ODXRS, aiding in selecting patients who will benefit from NAC.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed at assessing body composition parameters, creeping fat (CrF), and Crohn's disease's (CD) activity based on the Magnetic Resonance Index of Activity (MaRIA). 114 CD patients who underwent magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) between June 2010 and April 2020 were retrospectively assessed. The semi-automated body composition segmentation, the qualitative evaluation of CrF, and MaRIA were performed. Based on their MaRIA score, patients were divided into two groups: mild-to-moderate disease (MaRIA <11, n = 50) and severe disease (MaRIA ≥11, n = 64). MRE parameters were analyzed between both groups. Patients were dichotomized according to body composition categories and the presence of CrF. Univariate regression analyses were performed to investigate the association between dichotomized variables and severe disease. Significant variables were incorporated into the multivariate logistic regression model. The severe disease group exhibited higher serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels compared to the mild-to-moderate disease group (p ≤0.001). In the mild-to-moderate disease group, a higher proportion of patients had a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 (kg/m<sup>2</sup>) (32.0%) compared to the severe disease group (16.5%) (p = 0.04). The subcutaneous adipose tissue index (SATI) was significantly higher in the mild-to-moderate disease group (p = 0.04). The visceral to subcutaneous adipose tissue (VAT/SAT) ratio tended to be higher in the severe disease group (p = 0.09). There was no significant difference between both groups regarding total adipose tissue index (TATI) (p = 0.10), visceral adipose tissue index (VATI) (p = 0.51), intramuscular adipose tissue index (IMATI) (p = 0.38), skeletal muscle index (SMI) (p = 0.83), and sarcopenia (p = 0.75). In the multivariate analysis, CrF was significantly associated with severe disease (odds ratio [OR] 11.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.13-42.17; p ≤0.001). Additionally, a BMI ≥ 25 (kg/m<sup>2</sup>) was protective against severe disease (OR: 0.34, 95% CI 0.12-0.95; p = 0.04). CrF is significantly associated with CD activity.",

      "abstract": "Purpose: An approach for the automated segmentation of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) in multicenter water-fat MRI scans of the abdomen was investigated, using two different neural network architectures.   Methods: The two fully convolutional network architectures U-Net and V-Net were trained, evaluated and compared on the water-fat MRI data. Data of the study Tellus with 90 scans from a single center was used for a 10-fold cross-validation in which the most successful configuration for both networks was determined. These configurations were then tested on 20 scans of the multicenter study beta-cell function in JUvenile Diabetes and Obesity (BetaJudo), which involved a different study population and scanning device.   Results: The U-Net outperformed the used implementation of the V-Net in both cross-validation and testing. In cross-validation, the U-Net reached average dice scores of 0.988 (VAT) and 0.992 (SAT). The average of the absolute quantification errors amount to 0.67% (VAT) and 0.39% (SAT). On the multi-center test data, the U-Net performs only slightly worse, with average dice scores of 0.970 (VAT) and 0.987 (SAT) and quantification errors of 2.80% (VAT) and 1.65% (SAT).   Conclusion: The segmentations generated by the U-Net allow for reliable quantification and could therefore be viable for high-quality automated measurements of VAT and SAT in large-scale studies with minimal need for human intervention. The high performance on the multicenter test data furthermore shows the robustness of this approach for data of different patient demographics and imaging centers, as long as a consistent imaging protocol is used.",

      "doi": "10.1101/078816",
      "abstract": "Machine learning is a powerful set of techniques that has enhanced the abilities of neuroscientists to interpret information collected through EEG, fMRI, and MEG data. With these powerful techniques comes the danger of overfitting of hyper-parameters which can render results invalid, and cause a failure to generalize beyond the data set. We refer to this problem as  over-hyping and show that it is pernicious despite commonly used precautions. In particular, over-hyping occurs when an analysis is run repeatedly with slightly different analysis parameters and one set of results is selected based on the analysis. When this is done, the resulting method is unlikely to generalize to a new dataset, rendering it a partially, or perhaps even completely spurious result that will not be valid outside of the data used in the original analysis. While it is commonly assumed that cross-validation is an effective protection against such spurious results generated through overfitting or overhyping, this is not actually true. In this article, we show that both one-shot and iterative optimization of an analysis are prone to over-hyping, despite the use of cross-validation. We demonstrate that non-generalizable results can be obtained even on non-informative (i.e. random) data by modifying hyper-parameters in seemingly innocuous ways. We recommend a number of techniques for limiting over-hyping, such as lock-boxes, blind analyses, pre-registrations, and nested cross-validation. These techniques, are common in other fields that use machine learning, including computer science and physics. Adopting similar safeguards is critical for ensuring the robustness of machine-learning techniques in the neurosciences.",

We assessed clinical, endoscopic, imaging, and biochemical response/remission outcomes in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) treated with ustekinumab in a large Canadian IBD center.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA retrospective cohort study of CD patients was treated with ustekinumab. Clinical, endoscopic, radiological, and biochemical response and remission outcomes were stratified by prior biologic exposure status. Hazard ratios for biologic exposure status were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models and subgroup-specific incidence rates for healing.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 231 patients (55.9% female, median 45.8 years) were identified as receiving ustekinumab during the study period, with 2 patients subsequently excluded (N = 229). Of these patients, 79.0% (181 of 229) were bio-experienced, with 38.7% (70 of 181) having failed 1 biologic and 61.3% (111 of 181) having failed ≥2 biologics. At 3 months of follow-up after induction, clinical remission (Harvey-Bradshaw Index ≤4) was achieved by 59.1% (62 of 105) of bio-experienced patients and 79.4% (27 of 34) of bio-naïve patients (relative risk [RR], 1.34; 95% CI, 1.06-1.70; P = .013). Endoscopic remission (absence of mucosal ulcers) was achieved in 37.9% (33 of 87) cases. Rate of endoscopic healing (either endoscopic response or remission) per 1000 person-months was 72.7 (95% CI, 42.4-125.1) and 50.2 (37.9-66.4); and the median time to endoscopic response was 8.4 months (95% CI, 6.4-9.8) and 15.4 months (95% CI, 10.3-17.9) in bio-naïve vs bio-experienced patients, respectively. Imaging response/remission and steroid-free remission rates were higher in bio-naïve patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn this large real-world cohort of CD patients with complex phenotypes and high rates of prior biologic exposure, we observed that ustekinumab was effective and safe with higher rates of improvement in bio-naïve subjects across a range of end points.",

A total of 20 patients with pCD who have been refractory to standard therapy for at least six months will be included. Patients with a seton and stable treatment regimen will be included. Patients with anal strictures, rectovaginal fistulas, stoma or deep ulceration of the rectum will be excluded. Patients who are eligible but refuse HBO2 will be asked to serve as controls. Patients in the HBO2 group will be treated with 40 sessions of HBO2 therapy at 243-253 kPa, with the seton being removed after 30 sessions. Co-primary endpoints are changes in the perianal disease activity index and MRI-scores. Secondary outcomes are fistula drainage assessment, laboratory findings and patient-reported outcomes. Assessment will be done at baseline, 16 weeks, 34 weeks and 60 weeks after finishing HBO2. The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility and therapeutic effect of HBO2 on pCD.

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction  Perianal fistula and its recurrence is a challenging entity for surgeons. It is a well-establi1shed fact that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings influence surgical procedures and reduce the rate of recurrence. In this study, we assessed the contrast-enhanced (CE) three dimensional T1 sequences [sampling perfection with application optimized contrast using different flip angle evolution (SPACE) and volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination (VIBE)] in a 3T MRI system to evaluate perianal fistulas and compared them with two-dimensional (2D) sequences. Materials and Methods  Forty-four patients (mean age, 38.8 ± 15.3 [standard deviation]; 32 males, 12 females) with perianal fistula were included in this prospective study. The patients underwent conventional noncontrast, 2D sequences, diffusion-weighted imaging, followed by postcontrast, 2D T1 images in both axial and coronal planes, and 3D sequences at 3T. Acquisition times were recorded for each sequence. Each postcontrast sequence was evaluated in terms of image quality, presence of artifacts, fistula type, presence of an abscess, visibility, and number of internal orifices. The surgical findings were considered the gold standard. The imaging findings were compared with the surgical findings. Results  In all three sequences, the fistula type and abscess were identified correctly in all patients. The sensitivity value for identification of ramifications utilizing CE 3D T1 VIBE sequence, CE 3D T1 SPACE, and CE 2D T1 images was 100, 86, and 36%, respectively. The number of internal orifices was identified by the CE 3D T1 VIBE and CE 3D T1 SPACE sequences in 100 and 92% of patients, respectively. CE 2D T1 images correctly identified internal orifices in 80% of patients. The overall scan time for each 3D sequence was shorter than for the combined postcontrast 2D sequences. Conclusion  CE 3D T1 SPACE and CE 3D T1 VIBE sequences outperformed conventional CE 2D sequences in the evaluation of perianal fistulas in terms of visibility and the number of internal orifices with a shorter scanning time. Among the 3D sequences, CE 3D T1 VIBE is slightly superior to CE 3D T1 SPACE sequence.",

Based on a correlation analysis suggesting that diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) scores are more strongly correlated with overall PIRADS scores than other modalities such as dynamic contrast enhanced imaging or spectroscopy, we investigate the combination of T2-weighted imaging (T2w) and DWI as a potential diagnostic tool for prostate cancer detection, staging and guided biopsies. Quantification of the noise floor in the DWI images and careful fitting of the data suggests that the mono-exponential model provides a very good fit to the data and there is no evidence of non-Gaussian diffusion for $b$-values up to 1000 s/mm$^2$. This precludes the use of kurtosis or other non-Gaussian measures as a biomarker for prostate cancer in our case. However, the ADC scores for healthy and probably malignant regions are significantly lower for the latter in all 20 but one patient. The results suggest that a simplified mp-MRI protocol combining T2w and DWI may be a good compromise for a cost and time efficient, early-stage prostate cancer diagnostic programme, combining robust MR biomarkers for prostate cancer that can be reliably quantified and appear well-suited for general clinical practice.",

As expected, the Bio‐CD‐SS‐TPE micelles exhibit excellent AIE performance and cell imaging capability. With the effect of disulfide bonds, the PTX‐loaded micelles quickly release the drug upon the trigger of glutathione.

      "abstract": "Introduction Crohn’s disease (CD) is a relapsing inflammatory disease that is currently not curable. Despite the availability of anti-inflammatory treatments, 30–60% of patients develop resistance, necessitating the need for novel therapeutic approaches. Data from colitis models in mice indicate that granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-activated monocytes (GMaMs) may serve as a promising cellular therapy. However, it remains unclear whether inflammatory mediators, medication, or intrinsic defects impair the functionality of monocytes in active CD (aCD), potentially affecting their therapeutic efficacy. Methods Monocytes from 8 aCD patients and healthy donors (HDs) were activated in vitro with GM-CSF, and their migratory capacity, adherence, metabolic activity, surface marker expression, and cytokine release were assessed. Cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) to evaluate their inflammatory response. Results The GMaM phenotype was characterized by increased metabolic activity, enhanced production of inflammatory cytokines, stronger adhesion, and remodeling of surface receptors involved in T-cell activation, compared to naïve monocytes. These features were largely comparable between aCD patients and HDs. LPS stimulation of GMaMs from both groups resulted in a significant production of pro-inflammatory and chemotactic cytokines, particularly interleukin (IL)-8 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1. Both are crucial recruiters of neutrophils and monocytes. Notably, monocytes from aCD patients showed an increased IL-10 response to GM-CSF, while the LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma release were reduced compared to HDs. Discussion Peripheral monocytes from aCD patients retain functional responsiveness to GM-CSF activation, displaying preserved migratory, adhesive, metabolic, and cytokine responses. Differences in cytokine production by aCD monocytes may reflect disease-specific regulation, but do not appear to limit their suitability as cellular therapeutics.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Introduction Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune enteropathy characterized by atrophy of the intestinal mucosa triggered by the ingestion of gluten in individuals with a genetic predisposition. CD manifests with heterogeneous array of symptoms, including a wide range of intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms and manifestations (EIMs). The mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of EIMs in CD are not only related to intestinal mucosal damage and associated malabsorption but also to systemic inflammation. To date, the only effective treatment for CD is a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD). Proper adherence to the GFD leads in most cases to a gradual resolution of intestinal atrophy and results in an improvement of the clinical manifestations associated with intestinal damage. Areas covered This review, based on a Pubmed literature search, describes the extraintestinal complications associated with CD, emphasizing strategies for therapeutic management and responsiveness to the GFD. Expert opinion CD is associated with different EIMs which can affect different organs. The main clinical interest is if these complications respond to the GFD, which occur at variable rate and not for all disorders associated with CD. Therefore, often complementary additional therapies are needed to achieve optimal symptoms resolution.",

      "abstract": "Crohn's disease (CD) is a relapsing, systemic inflammatory disease that primarily affects the gastrointestinal tract and is often accompanied by extraintestinal manifestations and associated immune disorders. However, current pharmacological treatments for CD encounter several challenges, such as a lack of precise drug targeting and inadequate retention of drugs in the inflamed colon, along with low bioavailability. Herein, we utilized oleic acid (OA) as a solvent to enhance the bioavailability and solubility of emodin. Simultaneously, we encapsulated OA-emodin (OAE) into hydrogel microspheres (HMs) composed of hyaluronic acid (HA) and calcium alginate (CA) to develop a colon-targeted drug delivery system (HM@OAE) for CD therapy. The pH responsiveness of CA enabled HM@OAE to bypass the stomach and specifically target the colon, where it released OAE following oral administration. In addition, in vitro studies demonstrated that HM@OAE significantly reduced the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, decreased reactive oxygen species levels, and restrained ferroptosis by upregulating GPX4 and SLC7A11 expression while downregulating ACSL4 expression. Furthermore, to confirm these findings in a live organism, an in vivo study was conducted using a dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis mouse model. This study validated the therapeutic efficacy of HM@OAE, significantly alleviating colonic inflammation and restoring intestinal epithelial integrity. These results suggest that HM@OAE is a promising clinical candidate for CD treatment.",

      "abstract": "Vincristine (VCR) is one of the most widely used chemotherapy agents in treating pediatric cancer. Nonetheless, it is known to cause dose-dependent neurotoxicity which can impact virtually every organ system. Despite its widespread use, the precise impact of VCR on the lower urinary tract (LUT) remains inadequately elucidated. Our initial clinical and translational investigations suggest a sex-specific influence of childhood VCR exposure on LUT function. Thus, the current study aimed to investigate the late effects of systemic VCR exposure on LUT physiology and the underlying mechanisms, focusing on dosage and male-sex, employing juvenile CD-1 mice as a model. Male mice subjected to VCR exhibited augmented functional bladder capacity accompanied by frequent non-void contractions during awake cystometry, alongside mast cell accumulation within the bladder, compared to the saline-treated control group. Noteworthy functional changes were observed in bladder strips from the VCR group, including decreased nerve-mediated contraction, heightened contractile responses to cholinergic and purinergic agonists, enhanced responsiveness to histamine—primarily via histamine receptor 1 (Hrh1)—and an augmented relaxation effect with compound 48/80 (a mast cell degranulator), relative to the control group. Significant changes in gene expression levels associated with neuroinflammation and nociception were observed in both the bladder and lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia (Ls-DRG) of the VCR group. These findings suggest that VCR exposure during childhood, particularly in males, triggers neuroimmune responses in the bladder and Ls-DRG, amplifying responsiveness to neurotransmitters in the bladder, thereby contributing to LUT dysfunction characterized by a mixed bladder phenotype as a late effect during survivorship.",

We performed a retrospective study from June 2011 to June 2017 in the tertiary center, Claude Huriez Hospital in Lille, France. All SB CD patients, who underwent two magnetic resonance enterographies (MRE) 3-12 months apart, with at least 1-year follow-up after the second MRE, were included. Signs of radiological inflammation were identified by two expert radiologists in CD. Patients were classified as radiological responders (RR) and non-responders (NR). Hospitalization rates, adjustment of treatment, and surgical or endoscopic interventions were assessed and compared between RR and NR. Factors associated with a radiological response were also studied using the Cox model. One hundred and fifteen SB CD patients were included with a median follow-up of 17 months (IQR 11.6-28.3). There were 54 (47%) RR and 61 (53%) NR. The risk of surgical or endoscopic intervention was higher in NR than RR (p = 0.04), and the median delay until a surgical or endoscopic intervention was shorter in NR (p = 0.04). Multifocal disease, a hypersignal on diffusion-weighted or dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging, a stricture, or a fistula was significantly associated with a decreased probability of a radiological response (p < 0.05). This study shows that a radiological response is associated with a decreased risk of surgical or endoscopic intervention and should be considered as a therapeutic target in CD patients.",

Following treatment, MRI can provide information that suggests treatment success or failure.

However, many patients still fail to benefit from this treatment modality, and the exact mechanisms responsible for tumor response are unknown. Noninvasive treatment monitoring is crucial for longitudinal tumor characterization and the early detection of non-responders. While various medical imaging techniques can provide a morphological picture of the lesion and its surrounding tissue, a molecular-oriented imaging approach holds the key to unraveling biological effects that occur much earlier in the immunotherapy timeline. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a highly versatile imaging modality, where the image contrast can be tailored to emphasize a particular biophysical property of interest using advanced engineering of the imaging pipeline.

These are usually complex fistulas that adversely affect patients' quality of life, and their clinical management is difficult. Medical treatment sometimes achieves cessation of discharge and closure of the external opening; however, it is difficult to assess the status of the rest of the fistula tract. Magnetic resonance imaging is the method of choice with which to evaluate the condition of perianal fistulas and allows for assessment of the status of inaccessible areas. Magnetic resonance imaging also allows the clinician to evaluate other perianal manifestations of Crohn's disease that differ from the fistulas. This imaging technique is therefore a fundamental means of patient monitoring. When used in conjunction with assessment of the patient's morphological findings, it provides information that allows for both quantification of disease severity and evaluation of the response to treatment. New types of magnetic resonance sequences are emerging, such as diffusion, perfusion, and magnetisation transfer. These sequences may serve as biomarkers because they provide information reflecting the changes taking place at the molecular level.

Recent studies of mesenchymal stem cells have demonstrated safety and efficacy of this novel treatment approach. However, no studies to date have included pediatric patients. We sought to determine safety and efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells for pediatric perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease.<h4>Methods</h4>This was a phase I clinical trial to evaluate safety and feasibility of mesenchymal stem cells in pediatric perianal Crohn's patients 13 to 17 years of age. At the time of an exam under anesthesia, following curettage of the fistula tract and closure of the internal opening with absorbable suture, 75 million mesenchymal stem cells were administered with a 22-gauge needle. This was repeated at 3 months if complete clinical and radiographic healing were not achieved. Adverse and serious adverse events at were measured at postprocedure day 1, week 2, week 6, month 3, month 6, and month 12. Clinical healing, radiographic healing per magnetic resonance imaging, and patient-reported outcomes were measured at the same time points.<h4>Results</h4>Seven pediatric patients were enrolled and treated (6 male; median age of 16.7 years). There were no adverse or serious adverse events related to the investigational product or injection procedure. At 6 months, 83% had complete clinical and radiographic healing.

      "abstract": "Fistulizing anoperineal lesions (FAPLs) are common and severe complications of Crohn's disease (CD), exposing patients to the risk of anal sphincter alteration and permanent stoma. Due to the limited efficacy of current treatments, identifying new local therapies is mandatory. However, testing new treatments is currently limited because no relevant preclinical model of Crohn's-like FAPL is available. Thus, a reliable and reproducible experimental model of FAPLs is needed to assess new therapeutic strategies. Twenty-one rats received a rectal enema of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzensulfonic acid (TNBS) to induce proctitis. Seven days later, a transsphincteric fistula tract was created with a surgical thread, instilled with TNBS twice a week until its removal at day 7 (group 1), day 14 (group 2), or day 28 (group 3). In each rat, pelvic MRI was performed just before and 7 days after thread removal. Rats were sacrificed 7 days after thread removal for pathological assessment of the fistula tract. The optimal preclinical model was obtained in group 3. In this group, 7 days after thread removal, all animals (9 of 9) had a persistent fistula tract visible on MRI with T2-hypersignal (normalized T2 signal intensity: 2.36 ± 0.39 arbitrary units [a.u.] [2.08-2.81]) and elevation of the apparent diffusion coefficient (1.33 ± 0.16 10-3 millimeter squared per seconds [1.18-1.49]). The pathological examination of the fistula tract revealed acute and chronic inflammation, granulations, fibrosis, epithelialization, and proctitis in the adjacent rectum. This reproducible preclinical model could be used to assess the effectiveness of innovative treatments in perianal fistulizing CD.",

      "abstract": "Anoperineal lesion (APL) occurrence is a significant event in the evolution of Crohn's disease (CD). Management should involve a multidisciplinary approach combining the knowledge of the gastroenterologist, the colorectal surgeon and the radiologist who have appropriate experience in this area. Given the low level of evidence of available medical and surgical strategies, the aim of this work was to establish a French expert consensus on management of anal Crohn's disease. These recommendations were led under the aegis of the Société Nationale Française de Colo-Proctologie (SNFCP). They report a consensus on the management of perianal Crohn's disease lesions, including fistulas, ulceration and anorectal stenosis and propose an appropriate treatment strategy, as well as sphincter-preserving and multidisciplinary management. A panel of French gastroenterologists and colorectal surgeons with expertise in inflammatory bowel diseases reviewed the literature in order to provide practical management pathways for perianal CD. Analysis of the literature was made according to the recommendations of the Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS) to establish a level of proof for each publication and then to propose a rank of recommendation. When lack of factual data precluded ranking according to the HAS, proposals based on expert opinion were written. Therefore, once all the authors agreed on a consensual statement, it was then submitted to all the members of the SNFCP. As initial literature review stopped in December 2014, more recent European or international guidelines have been published since and were included in the analysis. MRI is recommended for complex secondary lesions, particularly after failure of previous medical and/or surgical treatments. For severe anal ulceration in Crohn's disease, maximal medical treatment with anti-TNF agent is recommended. After prolonged drainage of simple anal fistula by a flexible elastic loop or loosely tied seton, and after obtaining luminal and perineal remission by immunosuppressive therapy and/or anti-TNF agents, the surgical treatment options to be discussed are simple seton removal or injection of the fistula tract with biological glue. After prolonged loose-seton drainage of the complex anal fistula in Crohn's disease, and after obtaining luminal and perineal remission with anti-TNF ± immunosuppressive therapy, surgical treatment options are simple removal of seton and rectal advancement flap. Colostomy is indicated as a last option for severe APL, possibly associated with a proctectomy if there is refractory rectal involvement after failure of other medical and surgical treatments. The evaluation of anorectal stenosis of Crohn's disease (ARSCD) requires a physical examination, sometimes under anesthesia, plus endoscopy with biopsies and MRI to describe the stenosis itself, to identify associated inflammatory, infectious or dysplastic lesions, and to search for injury or fibrosis of the sphincter. Therapeutic strategy for ARSCD requires medical-surgical cooperation.",

      "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects ≈1.4 million people in North America and, because of its typical early age of onset and episodic disease course, IBD patients often undergo numerous imaging studies over the course of their lifetimes. Computed tomography (CT) has become the standard imaging modality for assessment of IBD patients because of its widespread availability, rapid image acquisition, and ability to evaluate intraluminal and extraluminal disease. However, repetitive CT imaging has been associated with a significant ionizing radiation risk to patients, making MRI an appealing alternative IBD imaging modality. Pelvic MRI is currently the imaging gold standard for detecting perianal disease, while recent studies indicate that MRI bowel-directed techniques (enteroclysis, enterography, colonography) can accurately evaluate bowel inflammation in IBD. With recent technical innovations leading to faster and higher resolution body MRI, the role of MRI in IBD evaluation is likely to continue to expand. Future applications include surveillance imaging, detection of mural fibrosis, and early assessment of therapy response.",

      "abstract": "Liver fibrosis represents the accumulation of excessive extracellular matrix caused by sustained hepatic injury. It disrupts normal lobular architecture and function, increasing the chances of cirrhosis and liver failure. Precise staging of fibrosis for early diagnosis and intervention is often invasive, which carries risks and complications. To address this challenge, recent advances in artificial intelligence-based liver segmentation and fibrosis staging offer a non-invasive alternative. As a result, the CARE 2025 Challenge aimed for automated methods to quantify and analyse liver fibrosis in real-world scenarios, using multi-centre, multi-modal, and multi-phase MRI data. This challenge included tasks of precise liver segmentation (LiSeg) and fibrosis staging (LiFS). In this study, we developed an automated pipeline for both tasks across all the provided MRI modalities. This pipeline integrates pseudo-labelling based on multi-modal co-registration, liver segmentation using deep neural networks, and liver fibrosis staging based on shape, textural, appearance, and directional (STAD) features derived from segmentation masks and MRI images. By solely using the released data with limited annotations, our proposed pipeline demonstrated excellent generalisability for all MRI modalities, achieving top-tier performance across all competition subtasks. This approach provides a rapid and reproducible framework for quantitative MRI-based liver fibrosis assessment, supporting early diagnosis and clinical decision-making.

Treatment with levetiracetam was effective for seizure suppression, and he had no other neurological abnormalities. Human leukocyte antigen typing revealed B54 and Cw1, which indicated the possibility of neuro-Sweet disease.

A cerebrospinal fluid test showed a mild elevation in protein levels without pleocytosis and a normal range of interleukin-6. Electroencephalography showed intermittent slow waves without epileptic discharge in the bilateral temporal lobes. We detected subtle flow voids in the pia mater of the left frontal lobe, which suggested cerebrovascular disease, and specifically, the possibility of dural arteriovenous fistulas. Computed tomography angiography showed abnormally dilated perimedullary veins in the left frontal lobe. Cerebral angiography confirmed the existence of four dural arteriovenous fistulas, which included two retrograde leptomeningeal venous drainages in the right frontal cortical veins supplied by the anterior branch of the right middle meningeal artery. The other dural arteriovenous fistulas were retrograde leptomeningeal venous drainages in the left frontal cortical veins supplied by the anterior and posterior convexity branches of the left middle meningeal artery. The patient underwent successful endovascular embolization of all dural arteriovenous fistulas with Onyx injection.

Methods This retrospective study included 40 steroid-naive patients (age 63.1±12.9 years, 20 men) diagnosed with CS who underwent both cardiac MRI and FDG-PET imaging. Active CS cases were defined as satisfying at least one of the following criteria for conventional indices: exacerbation of ventricular arrhythmia, newly identified advanced atrioventricular block, greater than 5% decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction on echocardiography, positive finding on gallium-scintigraphy or elevated levels of sarcoidosis-related serum biomarkers. T2W-STIR-BB images were semi-quantitatively analysed using a myocardium-to-spleen ratio (MSR). The diagnostic performance of T2W-STIR-BB and FDG-PET imaging for detecting active CS was investigated. Results Thirty-three patients satisfied at least one criterion and were considered as having active CS. Thirty patients (75%) tested positive with T2W-STIR-BB imaging, and 25 patients (63%) tested positive with FDG-PET. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive and negative predictive values for identifying active CS by semi-quantitative MSR on T2W-STIR-BB images were 79%, 43%, 73%, 87% and 30%, respectively. These results were statistically comparable to those of FDG-PET (70%, 71%, 70%, 92% and 33%, respectively). Conclusions When using conventional diagnostic indices for active CS as the gold standard, T2W-STIR-BB imaging demonstrated comparable diagnostic performance to that of FDG-PET. The semi-quantitative analysis of high signal intensity on T2W-STIR-BB images using MSR was useful for detection of active CS.",

Here, we present the case of MIE in a patient treated with rectal, oral, and intravenous metronidazole. This is the first case of MIE reported after suppositories. A 16-year-old girl with Crohn's disease treated with mesalazine and exclusive enteral nutrition was operated on due to perianal fistulas and abscesses. She received oral metronidazole for 25 days and rectal metronidazole for 15 days as an adjuvant before surgery. Moreover, 2.5 g of intravenous metronidazole was administrated during the perioperative period. The second day after the surgery, symptoms of cerebellar syndrome appeared. She presented with an inability to coordinate balance and gait. Although she showed accurate verbal responses, her speech was slow, slurred, and scanning. The finger-nose test was positive. The T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging revealed an increased symmetrical signal within the dentate nuclei of the cerebellum and in the corpus callosum. The changes were characterized by restricted diffusion. Based on the clinical picture and magnetic resonance imaging findings, MIE was diagnosed. Treatment with metronidazole was discontinued. The cumulative dose of metronidazole that she received for 29 days was 54 g: 38 g p.o., 13.5 g p.r., and 2.5 g i,v. The first symptoms appeared on the 28th day of antibiotic therapy after receiving 52 g of metronidazole. The neurological symptoms resolved after six days; however, three days after the resolution, paresthesia appeared in the distal phalanges of both feet and lasted for approximately two months.

Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (DWI) may indicate disease activity, but its predictive ability, if any, is unknown. We investigated the prognostic value of DWI for 1 year response or remission (RoR) in SBCD patients commencing biologic therapy, including incremental value over C-reactive protein (CRP) and faecal calprotectin (FC). Methods A subset of participants in a prospective, multicentre study investigating the predictive ability of motility MRI for 1-year RoR in patients starting biologic therapy for active SBCD, underwent additional DWI at baseline and post-induction (12-30 weeks). CRP and FC were collected in a subgroup. RoR at 1 year was evaluated using clinical and morphological MR enterography (MRE) parameters. We calculated sensitivity and specificity to predict RoR and quality of life (QoL) at 1 year, comparing apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value, Clermont score, and CRP using multivariable logistic regression. Results A total of 25 participants were included (mean 36.9 years, 32% female). ADC changes and Clermont score had poor sensitivity (30.0% [95% CI, 6.7-65.2] and 40.0% [95% CI, 12.2-73.8], respectively) and poor-to-modest specificity (50.0 [95% CI, 27.2-72.8] and 65.0% [95% CI, 40.8-84.6]) for RoR. None of Clermont score, CRP, or FC predicted QoL. Conclusions DWI has inadequate sensitivity and specificity for RoR at 1 year. There is no significant incremental prognostic value of DWI over CRP and FC to predict RoR and/or QoL at 1 year. Advances in knowledge Early post-induction DWI has no prognostic value for RoR at 1 year.",

Material and methods This is a retrospective study based on the data of 47 patients with a clinical diagnosis of perianal fistula, who had an MRI study performed on a 1.5-T GE Signa MR scanner. DWI sequences were done using 3 different b-values. Other routine MR sequences were included. The MR images were studied to compare the diagnostic efficacy of the DW MRI sequence and other sequences in diagnosing perianal fistula and its complications. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of abscesses and inflammatory soft tissue lesions were measured using ADC maps. The standard reference to obtain diagnostic efficacy was post-surgical data. Results Seventy-nine perianal fistulas were diagnosed in 47 patients who had undergone an MRI study. The sensitivity and specificity of different MR sequences in diagnosing perianal fistulas are T2 FSFSE: 92% sensitivity; DWI: 96% sensitivity; combined T2+DWI: 100% sensitivity; and post-gadolinium T1 FS has 100% sensitivity in diagnosing perianal fistulas. The mean apparent diffusion coefficient for the abscess in our study was 0.990 ± 0.05 × 10-3, and the mean apparent diffusion coefficient for an inflammatory soft tissue lesion was 1.440 ± 0.05 × 10-3. The optimal ADC cut-off for the abscess was 1.098 × 10-3 mm2/s showing 100% sensitivity and 93.8% specificity. Conclusions DW imaging is a reliable sequence to diagnose perianal fistula and its complications. Measurement of ADC values is reliable in diagnosing perianal abscess collection.

      "abstract": "Background Pre-operative MRI examination is currently considered as an evolving tool for assessment of perianal fistula types, extensions, and complications to achieve proper treatment plan. Proper assessment of fistula activity can also have a major contributing role to the treatment plan, through deciding the type of prescribed medications, proper surgical approach as well as the proper operative intervention timing. Reviewing literature, only few studies have mentioned the importance of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) sequences in diagnosing perianal fistula activity, yet many studies have discussed the perianal fistula activity assessment using other diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) sequences. In the present study, the main objective was to prove the MRI quantitative DTI sequences’ ability of diagnosing perianal fistulae inflammatory activity. Results This study was a prospective analysis in which fistular activity was confirmed by intra-operative findings (considered as the standard reference). The cases included in the study were divided into two groups, based on their surgical findings, positive inflammatory and negative inflammatory groups. Both groups were pre-operatively assessed using MRI imaging and additionally used diffusion weighted and tensor imaging (DWI and DTI) sequences by special post-processing quantitative assessment of DTI FA and ADC values. There was significant statistical difference between the mean ADC value of the PIA and NIA groups in the track, edema, ipsilateral and contralateral sphincter areas with P values ( P  = 0.000, 0.000, 0.002 and 0.000 respectively). There was also significant difference between the mean FA value of the PIA and NIA groups in the track, edema, ipsilateral and contralateral sphincter areas with P values ( P  = 0.000, 0.000, 0.000 and 0.008 respectively). Conclusion This study results revealed that FA are relatively lower in positive inflammatory activity lesions than in negative inflammatory activity lesions while the ADC values were relatively higher in positive inflammatory activity lesions than in negative inflammatory activity lesions and the differences were statistically significant having a fundamental role in the assessment of perianal fistula activity especially at the track area being of highest sensitivity and specificity. Unlike conventional MRI sequences which revealed only high specificity being a good negative modality.",

Aim To evaluate the role of diffusion-weighted MRI in the evaluation of perianal fistulae. Settings and Design A hospital-based cross-sectional study. Materials and Methods The study group composed of 47 patients of perianal fistula. MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was performed with Philips 0.5 T Ingenia scanner. DWI with different b-values (b = 50, b = 400, and b = 800 smm2) were obtained. The MRI findings were correlated with local clinical examination and or surgical findings. Statistical Analysis Used Chi-square test, independent samples t-test, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Result Fifty-nine perianal fistulas in 47 patients were included in the study sample. The visibility of perianal fistula on DWI was less than T2-weighted (T2W) and combined DWI-T2W images. Distinctly visualized (visibility score 2) perianal fistulas were observed in 47 fistulas (79.6%) on DWI, 54 (91.5%) on T2W, and 58 (98.3%) on DWI-T2W images. The mean of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of active fistula was 0.972 ± 0.127 [SD] 10−3 mm2/s and inactive was 1.232 ± 0.185 [SD] 10−3 mm2/s with a significant difference (p-value < 0.0005). A cut-off mean ADC value of 1.105 × 10−3 mm2/s was used to differentiate active from the inactive fistula with a sensitivity of 87.5% and specificity of 73.3%. Conclusion Combined DWI-T2W evaluation had a better performance in the detection of fistula than DWI or T2W alone. DWI with mean ADC calculation had a good performance in differentiating active from the inactive fistulas.",

This study aimed to determine the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and intestinal ultrasound (IUS) in the assessment of the radiologic response of Crohn's disease strictures to treatment.<h4>Methods</h4>The STRIDENT (Stricture Definition and Treatment) study was a randomized controlled trial of (2:1) intensive high-dose adalimumab combined with a thiopurine vs standard dose monotherapy adalimumab in patients with stricturing Crohn's disease. Clinical response was defined as a reduction in the Obstructive Symptom Score at 12 months. Intestinal ultrasound was performed at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 months and MRI at baseline and 12 months. This study examines secondary outcomes of stricture resolution and changes in stricture morphology with treatment.<h4>Results</h4>Of 77 patients, 52 were in the intensive treatment group and 25 in the standard therapy group. Clinical response was achieved in 56 of 77 patients (73%). Complete stricture resolution occurred in 17 patients on IUS (29%) and 16 patients on MRI (22%). Stricture improvement occurred in 23 of 59 patients on IUS (39%) and 24 of 72 patients on MRI (33%). Bowel wall thickness improved at 12 months on both IUS (P < .0001) and MRI (P < .001) and was significantly lower in clinical responders (IUS P = .003) and those with fecal calprotectin < 100 µg/g (IUS P < .001; MRI P = .001).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Radiologic severity of Crohn's disease strictures can improve with drug treatment, with complete stricture resolution observed in some. Intestinal ultrasound and MRI are effective modalities for monitoring the treatment response in patients with stricturing Crohn's disease (STRIDENT Drug Therapy Study: NCT03220841).",

      "abstract": "In patients with inflammatory bowel disease, we strive to achieve mucosal healing, as this has been shown to decrease the risk of disease flares, hospitalization, and surgery. For this reason, we must use objective measures of mucosal healing to inform our clinical decision-making and can no longer rely on patient symptoms alone. Assessment of small bowel Crohn's disease (SBCD) is particularly challenging given its lack of accessibility via standard endoscopic techniques. Ultrasound (US) represents a readily available, cost-effective, minimally invasive, radiation-free alternative for the assessment of small bowel disease. In this study, we performed a systematic review to determine the accuracy of ultrasound in diagnosing SBCD and its complications as compared with endoscopic visualization, surgery, and/or pathology. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL. Prospective cohort studies published up to March 2017 were reviewed. References meeting all eligibility criteria were assessed at the full-text level by 2 independent reviewers. Sensitivity and specificity were collected where available. A total of 2817 unique references were identified. Twenty-two studies were included. All studies were at low-moderate risk of bias based on the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies criteria. Transabdominal US (TAUS) yielded moderately high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of SBCD and its postoperative recurrence. Detection was more accurate for severe postoperative recurrence. The diagnostic accuracy of US in stricture and abscess detection was high. Contrast enhancement improved the detection of abscess. Diagnostic detection of fistulas was of moderate accuracy. Entero-enteric fistulization and entero-mesenteric fistulization were most clearly identified. Ultrasound can be used to diagnose SBCD in those with known or suspected Crohn's disease. It can be used to detect postoperative recurrence and can accurately identify abscesses and fistulas, especially with the aid of contrast enhancement.",

      "abstract": "One of the most common complications after pancreatic resections is an external pancreatic fistula. The main risk factor for pancreatic fistula is the “soft” structure of the pancreas. The aim of the study is to determine the possibility of computed tomography with contrast enhancement at the preoperative period in an objective assessment of the structure of the pancreas with pancreatoduodenal resections and prediction of pancreatic fistula in the postoperative period. Retrospectively, 102 patients were selected. Patients were divided into 2 groups depending on the structure of the pancreas according to computed tomography at the preoperative period. According to the data of preoperative CT with contrast enhancement, the structure of the pancreas was evaluated; density characteristics in native, arterial, venous, delayed phases (HU); pancreatic duct diameter. Group 1 included 37 patients with a “soft” pancreas. 65 patients with a “solid” pancreas were in group 2. In group 1, in 16 cases (43%), a clinically significant PF was formed in the postoperative period; in 21 cases (57%), the postoperative period proceeded uncomplicated. In group 2, in 5 cases (8%), the postoperative period was complicated by clinically significant PF; in 60 cases (92%), the postoperative period was uncomplicated. The development of clinically significant PF positively correlates with the “soft” pancreas (r = 0.374, p&lt;0.001), the density of pancreas of the native phase (r = 0.179, p = 0.099), the density of pancreas in the arterial phase (r = 0.208, p =0.054). Negatively correlates with the “solid” pancreas (r = -0.274, p&lt;0.001) and the pancreatic duct diameter (r = -0.339, p = 0.001).

Using computed tomography with contrast enhancement at the preoperative period, an objective assessment of the pancreatic structure is possible due to its density characteristics in the native and arterial phases of the scan to highlight a high-risk group for the development of clinically significant PF.",

      "abstract": "Recent years have brought increasing development of artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches aimed at optimizing clinical decision-making in vascular medicine. Models increasingly facilitate diagnostic interpretation, treatment planning, and prognosis prediction, particularly in complex cases of peripheral artery disease (PAD). In parallel, a major effort to integrate deep learning methods and imaging modalities has led to new opportunities for using anatomical data to enhance diagnostic capabilities. Among these modalities, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is gaining popularity as a noninvasive, nonionizing imaging tool with excellent soft tissue contrast and plaque characterization capabilities. Unlike conventional imaging, MRI can provide information on vascular composition-eg, soft tissue, fibrosis, and calcification-without exposing PAD patients to ionizing radiation and thus is an especially desirable modality for serial monitoring and long-term follow-up of PAD. In this review, we present an overview of the current state of AI integration with MRI in vascular imaging, with a particular focus on PAD. We also introduce several contributions from our research group, with our uniquely designed MRI protocol that incorporates ultrashort echo time and multicontrast sequences to improve vascular tissue characterization in PAD. These high-resolution datasets have served as the foundation for the development of deep learning-based classification systems, including both supervised and unsupervised models. Specifically, we describe how variational autoencoders and hybrid scoring systems have been used to phenotype PAD lesions and predict procedural factors such as guidewire crossability. Our work represents a step toward more objective, reproducible, and clinically interpretable tools that bridge high-fidelity imaging with scalable, AI-driven analysis.",

Although cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is less accessible, it can provide unique tissue characterization, including late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), T1 and T2 mapping, and extracellular volume (ECV), which are associated with tissue fibrosis, infiltration, and inflammation. Deep learning has been shown to uncover findings not recognized by clinicians, but it is unknown whether CMR-based tissue characteristics can be derived from echocardiographic videos using deep learning. The aim of this study was to assess the performance of a deep learning model applied to echocardiography to detect CMR-specific parameters, including LGE presence and abnormal T1, T2, or ECV. In a retrospective single-center study, adult patients with CMR and echocardiographic studies within 30 days were included. A video-based convolutional neural network was trained on echocardiographic videos to predict CMR-derived labels, including LGE presence and abnormal T1, T2, or ECV across echocardiographic views. The model was also trained to predict the presence or absence of wall motion abnormality (WMA) as a positive control for model function. The model performance was evaluated in a held-out test data set not used for training. The study population included 1,453 adult patients (mean age, 56 ± 18 years; 42% women) with 2,556 paired echocardiographic studies occurring at a median of 2 days after CMR (interquartile range, 2 days before to 6 days after). The model had high predictive capability for the presence of WMA (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.873; 95% CI, 0.816-0.922), which was used for positive control. However, the model was unable to reliably detect the presence of LGE (AUC = 0.699; 95% CI, 0.613-0.780) and abnormal native T1 (AUC = 0.614; 95% CI, 0.500-0.715), T2 (AUC = 0.553; 95% CI, 0.420-0.692), or ECV (AUC = 0.564; 95% CI, 0.455-0.691).

      "abstract": "Accurate staging of liver fibrosis from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is crucial in clinical practice. While conventional methods often focus on a specific sub-region, multi-view learning captures more information by analyzing multiple patches simultaneously. However, previous multi-view approaches could not typically calculate uncertainty by nature, and they generally integrate features from different views in a black-box fashion, hence compromising reliability as well as interpretability of the resulting models. In this work, we propose a new multi-view method based on evidential learning, referred to as MERIT, which tackles the two challenges in a unified framework. MERIT enables uncertainty quantification of the predictions to enhance reliability, and employs a logic-based combination rule to improve interpretability. Specifically, MERIT models the prediction from each sub-view as an opinion with quantified uncertainty under the guidance of the subjective logic theory. Furthermore, a distribution-aware base rate is introduced to enhance performance, particularly in scenarios involving class distribution shifts. Finally, MERIT adopts a feature-specific combination rule to explicitly fuse multi-view predictions, thereby enhancing interpretability. Results have showcased the effectiveness of the proposed MERIT, highlighting the reliability and offering both ad-hoc and post-hoc interpretability. They also illustrate that MERIT can elucidate the significance of each view in the decision-making process for liver fibrosis staging.

      "abstract": "In order to improve bioimages quality and improve diagnosis reliability, physicians need to use injectable contrast medium. Recently, a lot of studies reported the toxicity of these agents such as the correlation between repeated administration of Gadolinium MRI examinations and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. The direction is to define innovative techniques able to improve bioimages quality, minimizing the quantity of contrast medium, or define methods able to enhance images. Latter can be performed by using deep learning based machine learning techniques. In this work, we report preliminary work about the design of a deep learning architecture for bio-images enhancing, called DeLaBE, able to enrich information from images obtained with low or zero quantities of contrast liquid. DeLaBe is based on using a convolutional neural network reversing the standard workflow by using non-contrast images as ground truth. The cost function compares the prediction and the reference ground-truth image, which enables the optimization of the network parameters. During training of the DL model, the network parameters are updated with respect to the cost function comparing predicted and true non-contrast images. The goal is to improve the performance of the enhancing task by increasing the number of inputs as non-contrast images require a specific examination without agents administrations.",

However, such images do not provide quantitative T1 values. Advances in abdominal MRI techniques have enabled measurement of abdominal organs' T1 relaxation times, which can be used to create color-coded quantitative maps. T1 mapping is sensitive to tissue microenvironments including inflammation and fibrosis and has received substantial interest for noninvasive imaging of abdominal organ pathology. In particular, quantitative mapping provides a powerful tool for evaluation of diffuse disease by making apparent changes in T1 occurring across organs that may otherwise be difficult to identify. Quantitative measurement also facilitates sensitive monitoring of longitudinal T1 changes. Increased T1 in the liver helps to predict parenchymal fibroinflammation, in the pancreas is associated with reduced exocrine function from chronic or autoimmune pancreatitis, and in the kidney is associated with impaired renal function and aids diagnosis of chronic kidney disease. In this review, we describe the acquisition, postprocessing, and analysis of T1 maps in the abdomen and explore applications in the liver, spleen, pancreas, and kidney. We highlight practical aspects of implementation and standardization, technical pitfalls and confounding factors, and areas of likely greatest clinical impact.",

      "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cell treatment (MST) has emerged as a new therapeutic strategy for Crohn’s perianal fistulas. It has been demonstrated that a fibrotic tract on MRI with a MAGNIFI-CD score ≤ 6 is the best predictor for long-term clinical closure. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to analyse the effectiveness of MST for complex Crohn’s perianal fistulas based on MRI. Consecutive patients with complex Crohn’s perianal fistulas, previously failing both anti-TNF treatment and surgical closure, who had surgical closure of the internal opening with MST were included. The primary endpoint was radiological remission of the fistula(s) defined as a MAGNIFI-CD ≤ 6 on MRI, read by an experienced radiologist. Between December 2019 and March 2023, 30 patients (15 males) with 48 fistula tracts were included with a median follow-up of 16.5 months. Radiological remission was achieved in thirteen patients (43.3%) after a median follow-up of 5.0 months (IQR 3.0–6.0). The median MAGNIFI-CD at baseline was 15.0 (IQR 7.0–20.0) which significantly decreased to 8.0 (IQR 3.0–15.0) after treatment (p = 0.001). Clinical closure was achieved in 21 patients (70.0%). Three patients (14.3%) developed a recurrence during long-term FU, all with clinically closed fistula(s), but no radiological remission. The median PDAI decreased significantly from 10.5 (IQR 7.0–14.0) to 4.0 (IQR 0.0-7.3) (p = 0.001). MST is a promising treatment strategy for therapy refractory Crohn’s perianal fistulas, resulting in > 40% radiological remission, clinical closure in 70% and a significant improvement in quality of life. No recurrences were seen in patients with radiological remission.",

The purpose of this study was to validate baseline MM-SES-CD categories of severity and determine their prognostic value for predicting 1-year EH. Methods Participants in the SEAVUE trial (n = 386) were classified based on baseline endoscopic disease severity using MM-SES-CD cut-offs as mild (≥ 22.5 to < 31), moderate (≥ 31 to < 45), and severe (≥ 45) disease.

      "abstract": "<h4>Rationale</h4>Anal fistulas typically result from infected anal glands, presenting with symptoms like recurrent purulent discharge, pain, and itching around the anus. Infections are commonly located in the skin, soft tissues, or spaces surrounding the rectum and anal canal. Notably, extensive subcutaneous tissue infections in the buttocks are exceedingly uncommon. Distinguishing this condition from anal fistulas associated with Crohn disease poses a significant diagnostic challenge.<h4>Patient concerns</h4>A 27-year-old female patient presented with pain, swelling, and purulent discharge in the buttocks persisting for 6 months, with a recent exacerbation over the last 2 days.<h4>Diagnoses</h4>The diagnoses were established through a comprehensive medical history assessment, physical examination, enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the anal canal, and electronic colonoscopy, revealing: complex anal fistula, infected sinus in the buttock area, constipation, and mild anemia.<h4>Interventions</h4>The surgical intervention involving complete fistula dissection, excision of the affected area's apex in the buttocks, removal of necrotic material, fibrous tissue debridement, and thread-draped drainage facilitated fistula tract healing and markedly enhanced patients' quality of life.<h4>Outcomes</h4>After treatment, the patient showed no purulent discharge, swelling, or pain in the buttocks, and there was no bleeding or fluid leakage. The patient was followed up for 18 months after the treatment, and the wound healed well, with a satisfactory treatment outcome.<h4>Lessons</h4>In the context of diagnosing and treating anal fistulas, it is crucial to abandon the notion that infection is limited to the perianal region. Utilizing advanced magnetic resonance imaging of the anal canal is essential for precise localization, while employing a combination of diagnostic examinations is warranted for accurate differential diagnosis. Postsurgical follow-up of anal fistula patients for a minimum of 1 year is advisable to monitor recurrence and address predisposing factors like constipation. In instances of uncommon variants, it is advisable to engage in multidisciplinary cooperation to synthesize insights from various specialties, thereby enhancing the scientific rigor of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.",

      "abstract": "Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality remain high in recipients of a kidney transplant. The persistence of a patent arteriovenous fistula (AVF) after transplantation may contribute to ongoing maladaptive cardiovascular remodeling. The ability to reverse this maladaptive remodeling by ligation of this AVF is unknown. We conducted the first randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of AVF ligation on cardiac structure and function in stable kidney transplant recipients. In this randomized controlled trial, kidney transplant recipients (>12 months after transplantation with stable graft function) were randomized to AVF ligation or no intervention. All participants underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and at 6 months. The primary outcome was the change in left ventricular (LV) mass. Secondary outcomes included changes in LV volumes, left and right atrial areas, LV ejection fraction, NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) levels, cardiac output/index, brachial flows (ipsilateral to AVF), and pulmonary artery velocity. A total of 93 patients were screened, of whom 64 met the inclusion criteria and were randomized to the AVF ligation (n=33) or control (n=31) group. Fifty-four participants completed the study: 27 in the AVF ligation group and 27 in the control group. On the second cardiac magnetic resonance scan, a mean decrease of 22.1 g (95% CI, 15.0-29.1) was observed in LV mass in the AVF ligation group compared with a small increase of 1.2 g (95% CI, -4.8 to 7.2) in the control group ( P<0.001). Significant decreases in LV end-diastolic volumes, LV end-systolic volumes, cardiac output, cardiac index, atrial volumes, and NT-proBNP were also seen in the AVF closure group ( P<0.01). No significant changes were observed in LV ejection fraction ( P=0.93) and pulmonary artery velocity ( P=0.07). No significant complications were noted after AVF ligation.

      "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to provide indications for performing magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) in Crohn's disease (CD), the essential technical elements of MRE techniques and typical findings in patients with CD. Patients suffering from CD frequently require cross-sectional imaging. By performing MRE, it is possible to obtain results comparable to those obtained with endoscopy in terms of identifying and assessing disease activity and better than other cross-sectional imaging techniques, such as CT, in the evaluation of the fibrosis and complications of disease. The MR imaging of diffusion MR is a technique which enables medical staff to add important additional information and which may replace the use of intravenous contrast agents in the near future. Magnetic resonance enterography is an accurate tool for assessing bowel disease and the various complications associated with CD. The lack of exposure to non-ionizing radiation is an important advantage of this imaging technique, especially in the case of pediatric patients. Familiarity with common and pathognomonic imaging features of CD is essential for every clinician involved in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and the care of patients.",

      "abstract": "The Cholinergic Pathways Hyperintensities Scale (CHIPS) is a visual rating scale used to assess the extent of cholinergic white matter hyperintensities in T2-FLAIR images, serving as an indicator of dementia severity. However, the manual selection of four specific slices for rating throughout the entire brain is a time-consuming process. Our goal was to develop a deep learning-based model capable of automatically identifying the four slices relevant to CHIPS. To achieve this, we trained a 4-class slice classification model (BSCA) using the ADNI T2-FLAIR dataset (N=150) with the assistance of ResNet. Subsequently, we tested the model's performance on a local dataset (N=30). The results demonstrated the efficacy of our model, with an accuracy of 99.82% and an F1-score of 99.83%. This achievement highlights the potential impact of BSCA as an automatic screening tool, streamlining the selection of four specific T2-FLAIR slices that encompass white matter landmarks along the cholinergic pathways. Clinicians can leverage this tool to assess the risk of clinical dementia development efficiently.",

      "abstract": "The European Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology (ESGAR) presents an ESR Essentials review article on Crohn's disease (CD) diagnosis and treatment response assessment. The focus is on luminal disease, particularly in the small bowel, and to a lesser degree, the colon. Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE) and ultrasound are typically the first-line radiological investigations for known or suspected luminal CD. They are accurate for assessing the entirety of the bowel wall and extra-enteric tissues and are generally well tolerated by patients. CT has utility as well, especially in the acute setting. Disease location, extent, and phenotype should be assessed. Well-validated imaging signs of acute inflammation (active disease) are responsive to therapeutic interventions and include bowel mural thickening and oedema, perimural inflammation, ulceration, and hypervascularity. Other phenotypes (stricturing or penetrating with fistulae and/or abscesses) can coexist, and the predominant disease phenotype should be established. We recommend that radiologists work closely within multidisciplinary teams to optimise imaging selection for individual patients, tailored to the clinical question. Findings should be clearly communicated to best inform management decisions using standardised terminology, and structured reporting of disease status, treatment response categorisation, and any associated complications. KEY POINTS: MR Enterography and intestinal ultrasound are the key imaging modalities for the diagnosis and follow-up of luminal CD, with CT reserved primarily for the acute setting. Inflammation, or active disease, is the hallmark of luminal CD, and there are several validated mural and extramural imaging signs of activity, often coexisting with chronic changes. Changes in the imaging markers of active luminal CD are central to radiologists' judgement of treatment response and should be communicated in a standardised report in addition to any stricturing or penetrating complications.",

We evaluated whether IRE can be used to induce urinary obstruction for a rat model of renal scarring. Intrasurgical IRE (2000 V/cm, 90 pulses, 100 μs) with caliper electrodes was performed in the right proximal ureter in male rats (n = 24) which were euthanized at 2, 5, or 10 days post-treatment, following contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. Complete urinary tract (bilateral kidneys, ureter and bladder) was extracted, and scored on a five-point scale for renal dilation, ureteral dilation and hydronephrosis. Whole kidney sections underwent immunohistochemistry to quantify levels of macrophages (CD68), activated fibroblasts [α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)], collagen (Masson's Trichrome) and Hematoxylin and Eosin. Change in renal pelvis diameter and the number of glomeruli in the treated and contralateral urinary tract was also computed. Intrasurgical IRE performed with non-invasive caliper electrodes resulted in immediate loss of peristalsis in the treated ureteral segment, and cell death in the ureteral muscularis along with urothelial sloughing. Dilation of the ureter was observed on gross anatomic evaluation and histopathology. Magnetic resonance imaging indicated partial stricture and urinary obstruction in IRE-treated urinary tract, without evidence of urinoma, leakage or fistula formation. Enlargement of the kidney with progressive renal dilation and hydronephrosis was evident between Day 2 and Day 10 post-treatment. Obstructed kidney demonstrated scarring with elevated levels of tissue collagen, macrophages and α-SMA-positive fibroblasts. There was a steady decrease in the number of glomeruli in the obstructed kidney, while glomeruli numbers in the contralateral kidney remained unchanged through the 10-day observation period. IRE provides a safe and reproducible technique to induce partial ureteral obstruction and renal fibrosis in rat model without the need for ligation or its associated complications.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: Post-transplant allograft fibrosis remains a challenge in prolonging allograft survival. Regulated cell death has been widely implicated in various kidney diseases, including renal fibrosis. However, the role of different regulated cell death (RCD) pathways in post-transplant allograft fibrosis remains unclear. Methods and Results: Microarray transcriptome profiling and single-nuclei sequencing data of post-transplant fibrotic and normal grafts were obtained and used to identify RCD-related differentially expressed genes. The enrichment activity of nine RCD modalities in tissue and cells was examined using single-sample gene set enrichment analysis, and their relations with immune infiltration in renal allograft samples were also assessed. Parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells displayed heterogeneity in RCD activation. Additionally, cell–cell communication analysis was also conducted in fibrotic samples. Subsequently, weighted gene co-expression network analysis and seven machine learning algorithms were employed to identify RCD-related hub genes for renal fibrosis. A 9-gene signature, termed RCD risk score (RCDI), was constructed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and multivariate Cox regression algorithms. This signature showed robust accuracy in predicting 1-, 2-, and 3-year allograft survival status (area under the curve for 1-, 2-, and 3-year were 0.900, 0.877, 0.858, respectively). Immune infiltration analysis showed a strong correlation with RCDI and the nine model genes. Finally, molecular docking simulation suggested rapamycin, tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil exhibit strong interactions with core RCD-related receptors. Conclusions: In summary, this study explored the activation of nine RCD pathways and their relationships with immune traits, identified potential RCD-related hub genes associated with renal fibrosis, and highlighted potential therapeutic targets for renal allograft fibrosis.",

      "abstract": "Objectives: We examined the longitudinal and cross-sectional relationship between automated MRI-analysis and single-slice axial CT imaging for determining muscle size and muscle fat infiltration (MFI) of the anterior thigh. Methods: Twenty-two patients completing sex-hormone treatment expected to result in muscle hypertrophy (n = 12) and atrophy (n = 10) underwent MRI scans using 2-point Dixon fat/water-separated sequences and CT scans using a system operating at 120 kV and a fixed flux of 100 mA. At baseline and 12 months after, automated volumetric MRI analysis of the anterior thigh was performed bilaterally, and fat-free muscle volume and MFI were computed. In addition, cross-sectional area (CSA) and radiological attenuation (RA) (as a marker of fat infiltration) were calculated from single slice axial CT-images using threshold-assisted planimetry. Linear regression models were used to convert units. Results: There was a strong correlation between MRI-derived fat-free muscle volume and CT-derived CSA (R = 0.91), and between MRI-derived MFI and CT-derived RA (R = −0.81). The 95% limits of agreement were ±0.32 L for muscle volume and ±1.3% units for %MFI. The longitudinal change in muscle size and MFI was comparable across imaging modalities. Conclusions: Both automated MRI and single-slice CT-imaging can be used to reliably quantify anterior thigh muscle size and MFI. Advances in knowledge: This is the first study examining the intermodal agreement between automated MRI analysis and CT-image assessment of muscle size and MFI in the anterior thigh muscles. Our results support that both CT- and MRI-derived measures of muscle size and MFI can be used in clinical settings.",

      "abstract": "Numerous brain lesion and fMRI studies have linked individual differences in executive abilities and fluid intelligence to brain regions of the fronto-parietal \"multiple-demand\" (MD) network. Yet, fMRI studies have yielded conflicting evidence as to whether better executive abilities are associated with stronger or weaker MD activations and whether this relationship is restricted to the MD network. Here, in a large-sample (n=216) fMRI investigation, we found that stronger activity in MD regions - functionally defined in individual participants - was robustly associated with more accurate and faster responses on a spatial working memory task performed in the scanner, as well as fluid intelligence measured independently (n=114). In line with some prior claims about a relationship between language and fluid intelligence, we also found a weak association between activity in the brain regions of the left fronto-temporal language network during an independent passive reading task, and performance on the working memory task. However, controlling for the level of MD activity abolished this relationship, whereas the MD activity-behavior association remained highly reliable after controlling for the level of activity in the language network. Finally, we demonstrate how unreliable MD activity measures, coupled with small sample sizes, could falsely lead to the opposite, negative, association that has been reported in some prior studies. Taken together, these results demonstrate that a core component of individual differences variance in executive abilities and fluid intelligence is selectively and robustly positively associated with the level of activity in the MD network, a result that aligns well with lesion studies.",

      "abstract": "Intense admixture of honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) populations is mostly attributed to migratory beekeeping practices and replacement of queens and colonies with non-native races or hybrids of different subspecies. These two practices are also heavily carried out in Anatolia and Thrace where 5 subspecies reside naturally.Here, we carried out an analysis of population structure of honey bees sampled from six different regions (n = 250) in order to test the genetic impacts of migratory beekeeping, queen and colony trade and conservation efficacy of isolated regions. A total of 30 microsatellite markers were used in four multiplex reactions.Direct genetic impact of migratory beekeeping was demonstrated first time based on a comparison of assignment of individuals to their geographically native populations where migratory colonies showed less fidelity. We found genetic evidence for them acting as a hybrid zone mobile in space and time, becoming vectors of otherwise local gene combinations.The effects of honey bee trade were revealed by the presence of very high introgression levels from the highly commercial Caucasian bees naturally limited to a narrow range. We also measured the direction and magnitude of this gene flow connected with bee trade.Comparison between regions that are either open to migratory beekeeping or not let us evaluate the status of isolated regions as centers of limited gene flow and showed the importance of establishing such regions.Despite signs of gene flow, our findings confirm high levels of geographically structured genetic diversity of four subspecies of honey bees in Turkey and emphasize the need to develop policies to maintain this diversity.Our overall results might potentially bear a wider interest to the community since they constitute an important attempt to quantify the effects of anthropogenic impacts on established patterns of honey bee diversity. Our measurable and justified findings on migratory beekeeping, queen and colony replacements as well as conservation implications will hopefully be of use for the decision makers and other stakeholders.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

Despite advances in medical therapies, particularly anti-tumor necrosis factor agents, the majority of patients still require surgical intervention. Accurate diagnosis and monitoring are essential to optimise outcomes and guide multidisciplinary management. Although clinical scoring systems such as the perianal disease activity index are widely used, their subjective application limits their reproducibility and reliability, underscoring the need for more objective methods of evaluating perianal fistulising Crohn's disease activity. Imaging has thus become central to the objective assessment of perianal fistulising Crohn's disease, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) recognised as the gold standard in view of its ability to provide clear, detailed images of the perianal region in a radiation-free manner. Guidelines also endorse the use of imaging modalities such as endoanal ultrasound and transperineal ultrasound as viable alternatives to MRI for the assessment of perianal fistulising Crohn's disease in centres with appropriate expertise. This article aims to evaluate and compare the diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of MRI, endoanal ultrasound, and transperineal ultrasound in the assessment of perianal fistulising Crohn's disease, highlighting their respective strengths, limitations, and roles in clinical practice.",

All CD patients that consecutively underwent an ileocolonoscopy according to clinical practice were considered for the study, and those meeting eligibility criteria were enrolled and performed an IUS within a maximum interval of 7 days. Patients with stoma or ileorectal anastomosis were excluded, as well as patients with moderate-severe obesity or concomitant acute gastroenteritis. For every intestinal segment evaluated, IUS scores were calculated and compared to endoscopy results considering as remission a Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn’s Disease (SES-CD) ≤ 2. AUC was calculated for all scores. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n \n \n \n From June to September 2024 a total of 248 patients were considered for the study and 102 were enrolled. Seven were excluded due to the presentation of exclusion criteria. Ninety-five patients (110 intestinal segments) were analyzed. Median age was 45 years (IQR 35-55), approximately half of patients (48.4%) had isolated ileal disease and 56.8% were previously operated. Endoscopic activity was present in 40/110 cases (36.4%), with a median SES-CD of 2.21 (IQR 0-4). All scores correlated with endoscopy, as well as BWT and CDS alone (p<0.001). In univariate analysis, BWT, CDS and i-fat predicted endoscopic activity, while only CDS was an independent risk factor in multivariate analysis (OR 5.35, p=0.04). A ROC analysis was performed for all scores with AUC values of 0.74, 0.72, 0.72, 0.68 for IBUS-SAS, BUSS, Simple-US and SUS-CD, respectively. Regarding cut-off values, sensitivity was 62.5, 70, 55 and 70%, and specificity 77.5, 71.5, 84.3 and 50%, respectively.\n \n \n \n The US parameters BWT, CDS and i-fat correlated with endoscopic activity in CD patients. Our external validation demonstrated moderated accuracy of the available remission cut-offs of IUS scores.\n \n \n \n 1)G.

      "abstract": "Objective In patients with Crohn’s disease (CD) on combination therapy (infliximab and immunosuppressant) and stopping infliximab (cohort from the study of infliximab diSconTinuation in CrOhn’s disease patients in stable Remission on combined therapy with Immunosuppressors (STORI)), the risk of short-term (≤6 months) and mid/long-term relapse (>6 months) was associated with distinct blood protein profiles. Our aim was to test the external validity of this finding in the SPARE cohort (A proSpective Randomized Controlled Trial comParing infliximAb-antimetabolites Combination Therapy to Anti-metabolites monotheRapy and Infliximab monothErapy in Crohn's Disease Patients in Sustained Steroid-free Remission on Combination Therapy). Design In SPARE, patients with CD in sustained steroid-free clinical remission and on combination therapy were randomly allocated to three arms: continuing combination therapy, stopping infliximab or stopping immunosuppressant. In the baseline serum of the STORI and SPARE (arm stopping infliximab) cohorts, we studied 202 immune-related proteins. The proteins associated with time to relapse (univariable Cox model) were compared between STORI and SPARE. The discriminative ability of biomarkers (individually and combined in pairs) was evaluated by the c-statistic (concordance analysis) which was compared with C-reactive protein (CRP), faecal calprotectin and a previously validated model (CEASE). Results In STORI and SPARE, distinct blood protein profiles were associated with the risk of short-term (eg, high level: CRP, haptoglobin, interleukin-6, C-type lectin domain family 4 member C) and mid/long-term relapse (eg, low level: Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand, kallistatin, fibroblast growth factor 2). At external validation, the top 10 biomarker pairs showed a higher c-statistic than the CEASE model, CRP and faecal calprotectin in predicting short-term (0.76–0.80 vs 0.74 vs 0.71 vs 0.69, respectively) and mid/long-term relapse (0.66–0.68 vs 0.61 vs 0.52 vs 0.59, respectively). Conclusion In patients with CD stopping infliximab, we confirm that the risk of short-term and mid/long-term relapse is associated with distinct blood protein profiles showing the potential to guide infliximab withdrawal.

      "abstract": "Variations exist in the response of patients with Crohn’s disease (CD) to ustekinumab (UST) treatment, but the underlying cause remains unknown. Our objective was to investigate the involvement of immune cells and identify potential biomarkers that could predict the response to interleukin (IL) 12/23 inhibitors in patients with CD. The GSE207022 dataset, which consisted of 54 non-responders and 9 responders to UST in a CD cohort, was analyzed. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to screen the most powerful hub genes. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate the predictive performances of these genes. Single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) was used to estimate the proportions of immune cell types. These significantly altered genes were subjected to cluster analysis into immune cell-related infiltration. To validate the reliability of the candidates, patients prescribed UST as a first-line biologic in a prospective cohort were included as an independent validation dataset. A total of 99 DEGs were identified in the integrated dataset. GO and KEGG analyses revealed significant enrichment of immune response pathways in patients with CD. Thirteen genes (SOCS3, CD55, KDM5D, IGFBP5, LCN2, SLC15A1, XPNPEP2, HLA-DQA2, HMGCS2, DDX3Y, ITGB2, CDKN2B and HLA-DQA1), which were primarily associated with the response versus nonresponse patients, were identified and included in the LASSO analysis. These genes accurately predicted treatment response, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.938. T helper cell type 1 (Th1) cell polarization was comparatively strong in nonresponse individuals. Positive connections were observed between Th1 cells and the LCN2 and KDM5D genes. Furthermore, we employed an independent validation dataset and early experimental verification to validate the LCN2 and KDM5D genes as effective predictive markers. Th1 cell polarization is an important cause of nonresponse to UST therapy in patients with CD. LCN2 and KDM5D can be used as predictive markers to effectively identify nonresponse patients.

      "abstract": "Background Recently, intestinal ultrasound (IUS) scores such as International Bowel Ultrasound Segmental Activity Score (IBUS-SAS) and Simple Ultrasound Score for Crohn’s Disease (SUS-CD) have been established to evaluate disease activity in Crohn’s disease (CD), but these require further external validation. This study thus aimed to compare recent IUS scores in patients with colonic or small intestinal CD in order to objectively assess their value and appropriate application. Methods This retrospective study consecutively enrolled data of patients with CD from October 2020 to November 2022. The endoscopic and ultrasound images were collected, and the affected segments were rescored according to endoscopic scores [Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn’s Disease (SES-CD), Rutgeerts score for patients who have undergone surgery, and the Lewis score for CD of the small intestine]; IUS scores were also collected, including the IBUS-SAS, Ultrasound Consolidated Score (UCS), SUS-CD, Simple Ultrasound Score (Simple US Score), and Bowel Ultrasound Score (BUSS). Subsequently, the correlation of IUS scores with endoscopic scores and the identification of disease activity was calculated. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to calculate the correlation of parameters, and the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare different groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic efficiency of each score, and corresponding area under the curve (AUC), cutoff values, sensitivity, specificity, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results A total of 203 patients were included in this study. All scores correlated well with endoscopic scores and showed the ability to identify colonic CD activity with high sensitivity and specificity. Among all the scores, IBUS-SAS had the highest value overall and for colonic CD, with sensitivity of 92.7% and a specificity of 91.4% in identifying endoscopic activity and a sensitivity of 95.0% and a specificity of 88.2% in identifying severe endoscopic activity. In small intestinal CD, the UCS showed the highest correlation with endoscopic score, with a relative coefficient of 0.708. The corresponding cutoff values for identifying endoscopic activity and severe activity were also calculated. Conclusions Consistent with endoscopy, IUS scores are accurate in retrospective activity evaluation of CD, and suitable scores can be chosen according to the given circumstances.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background and aims</h4>Perianal fistuliing Crohn's disease [PFCD] is an aggressive phenotype of Crohn's disease defined by frequent relapses and disabling symptoms. A novel consensus classification system was recently outlined by the TOpCLASS consortium, which seeks to unify disease severity with patient-centred goals but has not yet been validated. We aimed to apply this to a real-world cohort and to identify factors that predict transition between classes over time.<h4>Methods</h4>We identified all patients with PFCD and at least one baseline and one follow-up pelvic MRI [pMRI]. TOpCLASS classification, disease characteristics, and imaging indices were collected retrospectively at time periods corresponding with respective MRIs.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 100 patients with PFCD, of whom 96 were assigned TOpCLASS Classes 1-2c at baseline. Most patients [78.1%] started in Class 2b, but changes in classification were observed in 52.1% of all patients. Male sex [72.0%, 46.6%, 40.0%, p = 0.03] and prior perianal surgery [52.0% vs 44.6% vs 40.0%, p = 0.02] were more frequently observed in those with improved class compared to unchanged and worsened class. Baseline pMRI indices were not associated with changes in classification; however, greater improvements in mVAI, MODIFI-CD, and PEMPAC were seen among those who improved. Linear mixed effect modelling identified only male sex [-0.31, 95% CI -0.60 to -0.02] with improvement in class.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The TOpCLASS classification highlights the dynamic nature of PFCD over time. However, our ability to predict transitions between classes remains limited and requires prospective assessment. Improvement in MRI index scores over time was associated with a transition to lower TOpCLASS classification.",

      "abstract": "Adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) experience a significant decline in quality of life due to various symptoms. Exercise has emerged as a potential therapeutic approach to improve IBD management, but its effectiveness requires further investigation. This systematic review, adhering to PRISMA 2020 guidelines, explored the effects of exercise on IBD progression and its potential as a treatment in adults. A comprehensive search strategy was conducted across three databases and two registries from May 12, 2024, to May 22, 2024. Methodological rigor and potential bias were minimized through quality assessment using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool 2 (RoB 2) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cohort studies, and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist for studies evaluating the effectiveness of non-randomized interventions. This process yielded 12 high-quality studies for analysis. The review identified positive evidence from both RCTs and observational studies. Exercise interventions demonstrated improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness, disease activity, quality of life, and mental health in adults with IBD. Studies explored various modalities, including aerobic exercise, resistance training, and mind-body interventions. However, further research is needed to optimize exercise prescription and elucidate the underlying mechanisms of action. This review strengthens the evidence for exercise as a beneficial intervention for IBD patients. Personalized exercise programs based on individual needs hold promise for improved IBD management and patient outcomes. However, limitations exist due to study design variations and the need for long-term follow-up studies.",

At one year following inclusion (Y1), BD progression was evaluated using the Lémann Index (LI). Magnetic resonance enterography was completed by all patients, with additional endoscopy and/or pelvic MRI based on disease location. Absence of BD was defined as a LI=0, and any presence of bowel damage was indicated by LI>0. Disability was assessed using the validated IBD-disability index (IBD-DI) encompassing various domains. We report the LI at Y1 and its association with significant disease features and with the IBD-DI.\n \n \n \n Among the 261 included patients, 135 have completed the Y1 visit, with 100 having their LI calculated [57% male, median age at diagnosis of 36 years old (IQR 26-48)]. Most patients (90%) had ileal or ileocolonic involvement, 68% had inflammatory phenotype, and 11% had perianal disease. At inclusion, 7% of patients had undergone surgery (5 intestinal and 2 perianal), and 53% had initiated biological therapy within the first year of disease, primarily anti-TNF in mono or combination therapy. Of those with stricturing (B2) or penetrating (B3) behaviour, 77% and 79%, respectively, were on anti-TNF therapy. Overall, 61% of the patients exhibited some degree of BD (LI>0), yet the median LI at Y1 was low [0.6 (IQR 0-2)].

Combined PET-MRI has been documented to be a reliable tool for evaluating intestinal metabolism, but clinical use has been limited due to accessibility, costs and lack of standardized methods to quantify inflammation. Our study aims to prove that combined PET-MRI can be used to detect active CD inflammation in small bowel.\n \n \n \n 25 patients with suspected ileal CD in ileocolonoscopy were recruited from Turku University Hospital’s outpatient clinic. The patients’ endoscopic findings in ileum were graded according to SES-CD- score (Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn’s disease). A static PET-MRI was obtained with [18F]-FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose) tracer and gadolinium contrast agent (Dotarem®). Hemoglobin (Hb), C-reactive protein (CRP), serum albumin (Alb) and fecal calprotectin (FC) were measured. After PET-MRI, a small bowel capsule endoscopy was done and the findings graded along the CECDAI-system (Capsule Endoscopy Crohn’s disease Activity Index). The patient’s symptoms were scored with a validated questionnaire. Medication data was also collected. The MR images with a small bowel protocol and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) were analyzed and the degree of inflammation graded on a visual scale of 1-4, from none to severe by an experienced abdominal radiologist. SUVmax (standardized uptake value) was measured from PET-sequences for each patient from terminal ileum.\n \n \n \n Twenty (80%) of the patients diagnosed with small bowel CD had mean SUVmax 3.40 (±1.54), while the 20% without CD diagnosis had lower SUVmax 2.15 (± 0.93) (p=0.047). Patients who were later treated with immunomodulators or biologics had higher SUVmax than patients who didn’t need medication or were treated with oral budesonide only (3.71 (±1.49) vs 2.07 (±0.82), p=0.0093). There was a correlation with SUVmax and visual MRI grading, CECDAI-score, ileal SES-CD-score and FC (r=0.406, p=0.049; r=0.504, p=0.056; r=0.419, p=0.042 and r=0.49, p=0.014 respectively). SUVmax correlated negatively with Alb (r=0.599, p=0.0025) but not with Hb, CRP or the symptom score of the patients.\n \n \n \n In this study we have shown that SUVmax measured from terminal ileum in combined PET-MRI could be used for prediction of patients CD progression. SUVmax also correlated with SES-CD-score, fecal calprotectin and serum albumin. These findings suggest that combined PET-MRI can be used in the future in diagnostics of small bowel CD. Further analyses are needed to define threshold values for small intestine CD.\n",

      "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Crohn's disease (CD) is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that is prevalent worldwide. It can affect any segment of the gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to the anus. When CD affects the anus, perianal fistulizing disease develops. The management of perianal CD is challenging and may require morbid surgery when there is no response to medical therapy. The emergence of novel biologic therapies, namely tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors, has proven to provide long-term relief and prevent disease-related complications. Perianal CD is, however, refractory or recurrent in up to 80% of patients. One of the reported options to manage perianal CD is hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), which aims at increasing tissue oxygen saturation in an attempt to promote repair and reverse local inflammation. Data on this approach is scant. <b>Methods</b>: A retrospective review was performed to identify patients with CD at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester who underwent HBOT for perianal disease between 2014 and 2023. Demographic and clinical data were reviewed, including the history of the disease, concomitant medical and surgical therapy and the need for fecal diversion. The HBOT regimen, including the number of sessions and clinical response, were reviewed. <b>Results</b>: Six patients aged from 19 to 60 years underwent HBOT for perianal CD. Two patients had a history of total proctocolectomy with ileal-anal pouch anastomosis (IPAA). All patients except one were on immunosuppressive medication including biologic agents. Four patients had fecal diversion with an ileostomy or colostomy. Patients received between 10 and 40 sessions of HBOT. Four patients reported symptomatic improvement. On physical examination and/or imaging assessment, improvement was noted in one patient.

The objective of the study was to determine the value of volumetric changes in CD perianal fistulas after medical treatment to predict outcomes.<h4>Methods</h4>This is a retrospective single-center pilot study evaluating CD patients with active perianal fistulas who started biological therapy between 2012 and 2021. Eligible patients were those who had both pre- and post-treatment pelvic MRI and clinical follow-up of 2-5 years. Patients were categorized as clinically active or in remission based on fistula drainage. Using specific software, we calculated the 3D volume of the fistulas, and their active and fibrotic components. We evaluated MRI volumetric changes between assessments and analyzed their predictive value for clinical remission.<h4>Results</h4>We included 24 patients (83.3% with complex fistulas), of which 13 were in clinical remission at the last follow-up. Logistic regression analysis identified the percentage of relative change in the volumetric active component as an independent predictor of clinical remission (OR 0.92 [0.86-0.98] p = 0.013). The area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 85.3% (p < 0.0001). A reduction of ≥ 16% in the volumetric percentage of the active component has a sensitivity of 84.6 and specificity of 81% in predicting clinical remission during follow-up.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Changes in the 3D MRI volumetry of perianal fistulas might have value in predicting clinical remission. Specifically, the reduction in the volumetry of the active component emerges as a promising biomarker for assessing therapeutic response.",

Aim of work Our study examined the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging with direct percutaneous instillation of hydrogen peroxide mixed with gadolinium (direct fistulography) in comparison to intravenous gadolinium contrast-enhanced study (indirect fistulography). Methods This prospective study was conducted on patients referred to Airforce hospital radiology department and were diagnosed with perianal fistula, Direct and indirect MR fistulography were performed using a 1.5T MRI scanner. The type of fistulae, internal openings, secondary branches, and abscesses were compared to surgical findings. Results Our study included 35 male patients. Both direct and indirect methods detected primary tracts with 97.1% sensitivity and accuracy rates of 91.9% and 89.2%, respectively. The direct method was superior in detecting secondary branches and internal openings with accuracy rates of 97.37% and 93.3%, respectively, compared to 86.8% and 86.6% for the indirect method, while the indirect method was superior in detecting abscess collections with 100% accuracy rate compared to 89.2% accuracy rate for the direct method. None of the patients reported fever or bleeding after the procedure. Conclusions Both direct and indirect fistulography showed comparable abilities in detecting primary fistulous tracts. However, the direct fistulography was superior in detecting internal openings and secondary tracts particularly in chronic cases, whereas indirect Fistulography was superior in detecting abscess collections. Incorporating both methods into our routine could thus improve the efficacy of surgical procedures.",

      "abstract": "Background: Anal fistula, which causes periodic swelling and pain in the perianal area followed by spontaneous leakage, is an abnormal connection between the anal canal and the perianal skin. The majority are connected to the development of abscesses, with a perianal fistula existing at the time of presentation in one-third of patients with an anorectal abscess. Objectives: to determine the safety and efficacy of the Ligation of Intersphicteric Fistulous Tract operation (LIFT) in comparison with fistulotomy. Patients and methods : On 60 patients with low trans-sphincteric perianal fistulas, this prospective, randomized comparative research was done at the General Surgery Department of Qena Faculty of Medicine. Patients were split into two groups: Group (A): 30 patients underwent LIFT techniques. Group (B): 30 patients underwent fistulotomy. The duration of the study ranged between 6-12 months, Results: Body Mass Index (BMI) was statistically substantial greater in patients treated by LIFT than those treated by fistulotomy. While pain score and healing time were statistically substantial lower in patients treated by LIFT than those treated by fistulotomy. There is no statistically substantial variation between patients treated by fistulotomy and LIFT as regard the development of complications as recurrence or incontinence. Conclusion: In comparison to open fistulotomy, the LIFT operation is a successful and preferred sphincter-saving method for fistula-in-ano, with a quicker healing period and a decreased frequency of postoperative anal leakage.",

Methods This was an open-label, single-arm clinical trial conducted at Jinling Hospital. Adult patients with complex treatment-refractory CD perianal fistulas (pfCD) were enrolled and received a single intralesional injection of 120 million TH-SC01 cells. Combined remission was defined as an absence of suppuration through an external orifice, complete re-epithelization, and absence of collections larger than 2 cm measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 24 weeks after cell administration. Results A total of 10 patients were enrolled. Six patients (60.0%) achieved combined remission at 24 weeks. The number of draining fistulas decreased in 9 (90.0%) and 7 (70.0%) patients at weeks 12 and 24, respectively. Significant improvement in Perianal Crohn Disease Activity Index, Pelvic MRI-Based Score, Crohn Disease Activity Index, and quality of life score were observed at 24 weeks. No serious adverse events occurred. The probability of remaining recurrence-free was 70% at week 52.

      "abstract": "Purpose Diagnosis of perianal fistula represents a challenge for surgeons. It is well known that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays an important role in that. The new 3D MRI sequence VISTA (Volume ISotopic Turbo spin echo Acquisition) can improve detection and characterization of perianal fistula compared with two-dimensional (2D) sequences. The aim of the study was to compare the diagnostic performance of the new 3D MRI sequence VISTA with the widely routinely used T2 FSE pulse sequence in depiction and characterization of perianal fistula by using the contrast-enhanced (CE) 3D T1 sequence THRIVE (T1-weighted high-resolution isotropic volume examination) as a reference standard. Material and methods Forty adult patients were enrolled in this prospective study. They underwent MRI perianal region examination using routine T2 TSE and CE 3D T1 sequence THRIVE with addition of the new 3D MRI sequence VISTA. T2, 3D VISTA and (CE) 3D T1 sequence THRIVE images were evaluated by two radiologists separately for detection and characterization of perianal fistula, then comparison between of T2 and 3D VISTA sequences was done using (CE) 3D T1 sequence THRIVE as a reference. Each sequence sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were calculated by both readers. Results For reader 1, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 92.5%, 90.5% and 93.6% for 3D VISTA and 84.1%, 83.7% and 87.3% for T2 FSE. For reader 2, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 91.5%, 92.8% and 94.8% for 3D VISTA and 82.9%, 84.5% and 86.7% for T2 FSE. Conclusions Using CE 3D T1 sequence THRIVE as the reference standard, 3D VISTA pulse sequence on the perianal region has better diagnostic performance in the detection and characterization of perianal fistula as compared to the routinely used T2 FSE sequence.",

      "abstract": "Objective:  Perianal fistulas are a common yet complex anorectal condition requiring precise anatomical assessment and tailored surgical management. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly utilized for guiding preoperative surgical planning. This study, therefore, aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics, the diagnostic performance of MRI, and the postoperative outcomes in patients who underwent surgical treatment for perianal fistulas.\nMethods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 111 patients who underwent perianal fistula surgery between January 2018 and January 2020. Demographic data, fistula classification (Parks and St. James's), surgical techniques, recurrence, morbidity, and Wexner incontinence scores were recorded. The diagnostic accuracy of MRI was calculated using intraoperative findings as the reference standard.\nResults: The median patient age was 45 years, with a strong male predominance (87 patients, 78.4%). The most common fistula type was intersphincteric (70 patients, 63.1%), followed by transsphincteric (33 patients, 29.7%) and suprasphincteric (8 patients, 7.2%). Seton placement was the most frequently performed surgical intervention (72.1%) [Düzeltme Gerekli - Ana Metin Kontrolü]. Postoperative fecal incontinence was observed in 7.2% of patients, and the recurrence rate was 8.1%. MRI demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy for suprasphincteric fistulas (sensitivity 100%, specificity 99%). Intersphincteric fistulas also showed high sensitivity (96%) but lower specificity (67.5%). Transsphincteric fistulas, however, demonstrated the lowest sensitivity (68.9%).\nConclusion: Conclusion: MRI is confirmed as a highly effective tool in the preoperative evaluation of perianal fistulas, particularly for identifying suprasphincteric tracts. Surgical treatment is generally safe, yielding acceptable rates of recurrence and continence impairment. Further prospective studies are warranted to validate these findings and optimize treatment strategies.",

However, there remains a paucity in the literature on the objective evaluation of sphincter integrity and fecal continence after the LIFT procedure.<h4>Objectives</h4>The present study undertakes a scoping review to systematically explore and map the published literature, to evaluate the sufficiency of data on the impact on continence in patients after the LIFT procedure.<h4>Design</h4>A systematic search of MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASe, CINAHL was performed from January 2007 to April 2020 and 597 publications were identified. Forty-two satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria. We performed a scoping review in accordance to the PRISMA-ScR guidelines.<h4>Results</h4>Only 3 (7.1%) of publications were randomized controlled trials, of which just 1 (2.4%) measured incontinence as a primary outcome. Continence was measured both pre- and post-LIFT in 30 (71.4%), of which 19 (45.2%) had a fixed protocol for continence assessment, which was heterogeneous between the studies. Continence was assessed using subjective scoring systems in 27 (64.3%) and objective measurement was performed in just 6 (14.3%). No studies performed post-operative anatomical assessment of the anal sphincter complex.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Long-term continence in post-LIFT patients is not supported with adequately powered prospective longitudinal trials using rigorously protocoled pre- and post-operative assessment of continence. Future research that focuses on a combination of objective assessment using anal manometry as well as anatomical assessment of the sphincter complex on top of subjective evaluation is needed before we can be certain if LIFT is indeed a sphincter and continence preserving technique.",

This study evaluated the long-term functional outcomes and influencing factors in male children with complicated anorectal malformations (ARMs).<h4>Methods</h4>We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of male children with complicated ARMs who underwent staged surgeries in our hospital from 2013 to 2016. Data collected included ARM type, perianal muscle development, anorectal manometry findings, lumbosacral MRI findings and the intervals between the first and third operation. Bowel function after the operation was assessed by questionnaire (modified Rintala score).

      "abstract": "<h4>Purpose</h4>This retrospective study evaluates the clinical efficacy of the Intersphincteric Approach with Internal Incision combined with Counter-Drainage (IAICD) for Deep Perianal Abscess (DPA), thereby providing a foundation for selecting optimal surgical treatment methods in clinical practice.<h4>Methods</h4>Using a retrospective cohort study design, we analyzed the clinical data of 120 patients who underwent inpatient surgical treatment for DPA at our hospital from January 2022 to June 2023. Of these, 57 patients underwent the IAICD (treatment group), while 63 patients received incision-drainage (control group). Clinical data from both groups were collected for statistical analysis. The primary outcomes measured were clinical efficacy, anal function scores and appearance scores. Secondary outcomes included postoperative pain, operation time, wound healing time and length of hospital stay.<h4>Results</h4>The treatment group had 52 cured cases, with a cure rate of 52/57 (91.2%), whereas the control group had 48 cured cases, with a cure rate of 48/63 (76.2%). The treatment group's clinical efficacy was significantly better than the control group (P = 0.03). The operation time was longer in the treatment group compared to the control group (P < 0.01). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of anal function scores, appearance scores, postoperative pain, wound healing time and length of hospital stay (P > 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that IAICD was a protective factor for the clinical efficacy of DPA patients (P = 0.01), While wound healing time and a history of perianal surgery were identified as independent risk factors associated with poor prognosis in patients with DPA (P = 0.039, P = 0.032).<h4>Conclusion</h4>For patients with DPA who have high expectations for minimizing postoperative recurrence, a comprehensive preoperative evaluation-including a history of prior perianal surgery-precise intraoperative localization of the internal opening, and meticulous postoperative wound care can collectively optimize clinical outcomes. The IAICD procedure not only preserves anal sphincter function but also effectively reduces the recurrence rate of postoperative abscesses or fistula formation.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background and aims</h4>Previous literature suggests that faecal calprotectin (FC) discriminates Crohn's disease perianal fistulas from cryptoglandular fistulas, irrespective of luminal disease. This study aims to prospectively validate this and analyse if increased local fistula calprotectin levels are associated with fistula characteristics.<h4>Methods</h4>In this prospective study, all consecutive patients with an active perianal fistula undergoing examination under anaesthesia were included. Faecal and fistula tract scraping calprotectin levels were determined. The primary objective was to analyse whether FC levels could be used to differentiate between Crohn's disease and cryptoglandular perianal fistulas. Secondary outcome parameters were the levels of local calprotectin in fistula scrapings and their correlation with fistula characteristics.<h4>Results</h4>Sixty-three patients were included in this study (perianal Crohn's disease; 45, cryptoglandular; 18). Faecal calprotectin levels were significantly higher in Crohn's disease patients compared with cryptoglandular fistula (354.3 [58.8-1076.3] vs. 47.3 [14.6-233.6] μg/g, p = 0.003). Faecal calprotectin could accurately discriminate Crohn's disease patients with active luminal disease from patients without luminal disease (median [interquartile range]) (1167.0 [557.0-2806.3] vs. 93.0 [47.5-571.6] μg/g, p = 0.001). Faecal calprotectin was not related to calprotectin levels in fistula scrapings. No fistula characteristic was found to be correlated to scraping calprotectin, but a correlation was found with the TOpCLASS classification system, which stratifies fistulas according to disease severity and outcome: class 2a (amenable for repair), class 2b (symptom control) and class 2c (gradually debilitating disease): 140[31.0-149.0]) μg/g versus 706[198.5-1936] μg/g versus 4000[1337-5894] μg/g, p < 0.001). Scraping calprotectin was also related to pronounced hyperintensity of the fistula tract on MRI in Crohn's disease patients: (69.0[30.0-821.0] vs. 1284.0[204.3-4185.5]; p = 0.01)) and cryptoglandular patients: (30.0[13.5-80.5] vs. 3012.0 [923.8-5021.0]; p = 0.002).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Crohn's disease and cryptoglandular perianal fistulas differ in FC levels. Local fistula calprotectin production did not explain this difference, implying FC reflects the luminal condition. A correlation exists between scraping calprotectin levels and Crohn's disease fistula severity, which could be clinically relevant for prognostic cohorts and tailored treatment.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Objectives</h4>The histopathological composition of a stricture impacts clinical treatment choice. Therefore, imaging biomarkers that can distinguish a predominantly inflammatory from a chronic (i.e., non-inflammatory) stricture are highly relevant. The aim of our study was to determine whether it is possible to distinguish inflammatory (i.e., inflammatory and mixed) from chronic (i.e., non-inflammatory) strictures using quantified motility measured on cine-MRI in Crohn's disease (CD) patients.<h4>Methods</h4>In this prospective cross-sectional study, consecutive CD patients scheduled for small bowel resection underwent 2D cine-MRI prior to surgery. The motility of small bowel strictures and pre-stricture dilatations was quantified using a validated post-processing method (GIQuant). The resection specimens were scored by two pathologists as either: predominantly inflammatory, mixed, or predominantly chronic (i.e., non-inflammatory). For the analysis, strictures were stratified into inflammatory strictures (i.e., predominantly inflammatory and mixed) and chronic (i.e., non-inflammatory) strictures.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty-eight patients were included with 30 strictures and 15 pre-stricture dilatations. Pre-stricture dilatation motility was higher for chronic (i.e., non-inflammatory) compared to inflammatory (i.e., inflammatory and mixed) strictures (289.5 AU [188.0-362.9] vs. 113.1 AU [83.6-142.4], P = .004). The area under the curve (AUC) for chronic (i.e., non-inflammatory) stricture detection was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.78-1.0, P = .01). Within strictures, no difference was found between motility in different histopathology categories (P = .6).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Motility in the pre-stricture dilatations of chronic (i.e., non-inflammatory) strictures was higher compared to inflammatory (i.e., inflammatory and mixed) strictures. No difference in motility was observed in stricture motility among stricture subtypes. Our findings suggest that quantified motility-measured with cine-MRI-of pre-stricture dilatations could possibly distinguish chronic (i.e., non-inflammatory) strictures from inflammatory (i.e., inflammatory and mixed) strictures.<h4>Advances in knowledge</h4>Motility measured with cine-MRI could provide an imaging biomarker for the distinction between chronic (i.e., non-inflammatory) and inflammatory (i.e., inflammatory and mixed) strictures in CD.",

Patients were classified according to the Montreal Classification in uncomplicated (non-stricturing, non-penetrating, B1), and complicated (structuring [B2] and penetrating disease [B3]). At the level of the third lumbar vertebra, the ADC and PMI were estimated. CD activity was analysed using the Magnetic Resonance Index of Activity (MaRIA), and depending on its values patients were categorized as high or low activity. Additionally, the presence of creeping fat (CrF) was used to evaluate activity. ADC and PMI were using Student's <i>t</i>-test.<h4>Results</h4>Our study included 47 males and 41 females (mean age of 38.69 ±14.4 years).

The group with non-penetrating disease showed higher PMI than those with penetrating disease (5.71 ±1.88 vs. 4.42 ±1.55 cm<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively, <i>p</i> = 0.10). There was no significant difference in PMI and ADC between patients with low and high MaRIA or positive and negative CrF.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The ADC of the psoas muscles is significantly lower in CD patients with uncomplicated disease, particularly those with stricturing disease.

We are motivated by applications where response varies by individuals and therefore, estimating responses at the individual-level is valuable for personalizing decision-making. We refer to this as the problem of estimating individualized treatment response (ITR) curves. In statistics, G-computation formula (Robins, 1986) has been commonly used for estimating treatment responses from observational data containing sequential treatment assignments. However, past studies have focused predominantly on obtaining point-in-time estimates at the population level. We leverage the G-computation formula and develop a novel Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) method that can flexibly model functional data and provide posterior inference over the treatment response curves at both the individual and population level. On a challenging dataset containing time series from patients admitted to a hospital, we estimate responses to treatments used in managing kidney function and show that the resulting fits are more accurate than alternative approaches. Accurate methods for obtaining ITRs from observational data can dramatically accelerate the pace at which personalized treatment plans become possible.",

      "abstract": "Current endoscopic activity scores for ulcerative colitis (UC) do not take into account the extent of mucosal inflammation. We have developed a simple endoscopic index for UC that takes into account the severity and distribution of mucosal inflammation. In this multicentre trial, UC patients undergoing colonoscopy were prospectively enrolled. For the Modified Score (MS), the sum of Mayo Endoscopic Subscores (MESs) for five colon segments (ascending, transverse, descending, sigmoid and rectum) was calculated. The Extended Modified Score (EMS) was obtained by multiplying the MS by the maximal extent of inflammation. The Modified Mayo Endoscopic Score (MMES) was obtained by dividing the EMS by the number of segments with active inflammation. Colon biopsies were obtained from the rectum and sigmoid, as well as from all inflamed segments, by standard methods. Clinical activity was scored according to the Partial Mayo Score (PMS). Biological activity was scored according to C-reactive protein (CRP) and faecal calprotectin (FC) levels. Histological activity was scored according to the Geboes Score (GS). One hundred and seventy-one UC patients (38% female, median age 47 years, median disease duration 13 years) were included. The MMES correlated significantly with the PMS (r = 0.535), CRP (r = 0.238), FC (r = 0.730) and GS (r = 0.615) (all p < 0.001). Median MMES scores were significantly higher in patients with clinical, biological or histological activity (all p ≤ 0.001) CONCLUSIONS: The MMES is an easy to use endoscopic index for UC that combines the severity analysis of the MES with disease extent, and correlates very well with clinical, biological and histological disease activity.",

This study evaluates relapse rates after AZA discontinuation in adult IBD patients in remission and identifies predictors of relapse. <b>Methods</b>: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted according to PRISMA 2020 guidelines and registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251016594). Databases were searched from inception to 4 January 2025, including RCTs and cohort studies involving adult IBD patients who discontinued AZA in clinical remission. The main outcome assessed was relapse incidence, with additional outcomes covering time until relapse, predictors of relapse, and management following relapse. Random-effects meta-analysis, subgroup analyses, and meta-regression were performed. <b>Results</b>: Twenty-two studies comprising 3057 patients were included. The pooled relapse rate after AZA withdrawal was 32.5% (95% CI: 28.2-37.2%; I<sup>2</sup> = 94.2%). UC patients exhibited higher relapse rates (41.3%) than CD patients (24.7%, <i>p</i> = 0.003). Shorter AZA duration, elevated CRP, and absence of mucosal healing were associated with increased relapse risk. Meta-regression identified AZA duration as a significant predictor (β = -0.18, <i>p</i> = 0.009). Post-relapse management often involved AZA reintroduction or escalation to biologics, with low surgery rates. The GRADE assessment revealed that the certainty of evidence for the majority of primary outcomes was classified as low to very low. <b>Conclusions</b>: While this meta-analysis suggests that relapse after AZA withdrawal occurs frequently in IBD patients, the low to very low certainty of evidence limits definitive recommendations. The significant heterogeneity indicates that relapse risk varies across different patient populations and different settings.",

      "abstract": "Accurate tools to distinguish Crohn's disease [CD] from cryptoglandular disease in patients with perianal fistulas without detectable luminal inflammation on ileocolonoscopy and abdominal enterography (isolated perianal fistulas [IPF]) are lacking. We assessed the ability of video capsule endoscopy [VCE] to detect luminal inflammation in patients with IPF. We studied consecutive adults [>17 years] with IPF who were evaluated by VCE after a negative ileocolonoscopy and abdominal enterography between 2013 and 2022. We defined luminal CD by VCE as diffuse erythema, three or more aphthous ulcers, or a Lewis score greater than 135. We compared rates of intestinal inflammation in this cohort with age- and sex-matched controls without perianal fistulas, who underwent VCE for other indications. We excluded persons with pre-existing inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] and exposure to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or immunosuppressive treatments. A total of 45 patients with IPF underwent VCE without complications. Twelve patients [26%] met our definition of luminal CD. Luminal CD was more common in patients with IPF than in controls [26% vs 3%; p <0.01]. Among patients with IPF, male sex (OR [odds ratio], 9.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.1-79.4]), smoking (OR, 4.5; 95% CI [0.9-21.2]), abscess (OR, 6.3; 95% CI [1.5-26.8]), rectal enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] (OR, 9.0; 95% CI [0.8-99.3]), and positive antimicrobial serology (OR, 7.1; 95% CI, [0.7-70.0]) were more common in those with a positive VCE study.

The aim of this study is to validate the application of the sellar barrier concept for predicting intraoperative CSF leak in endoscopic endonasal surgery for pituitary adenomas with a machine learning approach. We conducted a prospective cohort study, from June 2019 to September 2020: data from 155 patients with pituitary subdiaphragmatic adenoma operated through endoscopic approach at the Division of Neurosurgery, Università degli Studi di Napoli \"Federico II,\" were included. Preoperative magnetic resonance images (MRI) and intraoperative findings were analyzed. After processing patient data, the experiment was conducted as a novelty detection problem, splitting outliers (i.e., patients with intraoperative fistula, <i>n</i> = 11/155) and inliers into separate datasets, the latter further separated into training (<i>n</i> = 115/144) and inlier test (<i>n</i> = 29/144) datasets. The machine learning analysis was performed using different novelty detection algorithms [isolation forest, local outlier factor, one-class support vector machine (oSVM)], whose performance was assessed separately and as an ensemble on the inlier and outlier test sets. According to the type of sellar barrier, patients were classified into two groups, i.e., strong and weak barrier; a third category of mixed barrier was defined when a case was neither weak nor strong. Significant differences between the three datasets were found for Knosp classification score (<i>p</i> = 0.0015), MRI barrier: strong (<i>p</i> = 1.405 × 10<sup>-6</sup>), MRI barrier: weak (<i>p</i> = 4.487 × 10<sup>-8</sup>), intraoperative barrier: strong (<i>p</i> = 2.788 × 10<sup>-7</sup>), and intraoperative barrier: weak (<i>p</i> = 2.191 × 10<sup>-10</sup>). We recorded 11 cases of intraoperative leakage that occurred in the majority of patients presenting a <i>weak sellar barrier</i> (<i>p</i> = 4.487 × 10<sup>-8</sup>) at preoperative MRI. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for outlier detection were 0.70, 0.64, and 0.72 for IF; 0.85, 0.45, and 1.00 for LOF; 0.83, 0.64, and 0.90 for oSVM; and 0.83, 0.55, and 0.93 for the ensemble, respectively.

To date, there is no clinically used validated quantitative ultrasonographic score for assessing disease activity. For magnetic resonance enterography (MRE), the magnetic resonance index of activity (MaRIA) is most used. The goal of this study was to devise a new quantitative IUS score for assessing Crohn's disease inflammation, by using a partial MaRIA score as a reference. This was a retrospective cohort study. The study cohort included patients with Crohn's disease followed between January 2016 and December 2018. Inclusion criteria were age >18 and <3 months between MRE and IUS. Linear/logistic regression was performed for the correlation of ultrasonographic parameters with MaRIA score. Ultrasonograpic features included: bowel wall thickness, disrupted bowel wall stratification, mesenteric fat proliferation, presence of lymph nodes, hypervascularity present on color Doppler flow, and the presence of complications (strictures, inflammatory mass, and fistula). Forty-two patients were included. A stepwise multiple regression model was constructed to predict MaRIA score using ultrasound features. Two variables were found to be independently significant: terminal ileum (TI) thickness (r = 0.68, P = 0.001) and mesenteric fat proliferation (r = 0.45, P = 0.019). A model was constructed as follows: MaRIA = 7 + 2.5 * TI US thickness (mm) + 7 * US fat proliferation (0 = no, 1 = yes). This model has an R2 of 0.51 for explaining the variability in the results. IUS measurements are significantly correlated with MaRIA score in the terminal ileum and a simple computational model can be constructed.",

A new classification(NC), published in 2017, proposed to classify fistulas as per their severity and also guided in its management. The early grades (NC grade I & II) were simple fistulas and were amenable to fistulotomy whereas higher grades (NC grade III-V) were complex fistulas and were not amenable to fistulotomy. Lower grades of all the three classifications were classified as simple (Parks: I, SJUH:I-II, NC:I-II) whereas higher grades were classified as complex (Parks: II-IV, SJUH: III-V, NC: III-V) fistulas. Fistulotomy should be possible in simple fistulas but not in complex fistulas. This was analysed for all these classifications. The long-term follow-up of continence was done by an objective scoring system (Vaizey's scores). The SJUH & Parks classifications categorized 504/828 fistulas as 'complex' which was quite inaccurate as 42.7%(215/504) of these fistulas were safely amenable to fistulotomy. On the other hand, the New classification (NC) classified 282/828 fistulas as 'complex' which was very accurate as 99% (279/282) of these were actually complex and were not amenable to fistulotomy. The change in the preoperative and the postoperative continence scores in the patients who underwent fistulotomy, as per these classifications, Parks & SJUH vs NC, was 0.064 ± 0.62 and 0.089 ± 0.85 respectively and was not significantly different(p = 0.80, Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test).

We retrospectively reviewed 350 consecutive MRI examinations performed between 2013 and 2016 in outpatients or inpatients with histologically proven CD, monitored by the Gastroenterology and Pediatric Units of our Hospital. The magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) protocol for adult and pediatric CD patients routinely includes evaluation of nine different intestinal segments (from jejunum to rectum) and of the anal canal. Intestinal activity was also calculated using a validated score. Perianal disease (PD) was staged. Fisher's exact test was used and the odds ratio (OR) was calculated. Two hundred and nineteen out of 350 MRI studies (118 adults and 101 children) were included. The prevalence of PD was 34.6% in children and 16.1% in adults (OR = 2.8; p = 0.0017). Pediatric patients showed more frequent rectal involvement (29.7% vs 13.5%, OR = 2.7; p = 0.0045) and higher risk of PD in the presence of rectal disease (p = 0.043; OR = 4.5). In pediatric patients with severe colorectal disease, the prevalence of PD was twofold (86.7% vs 40%; p = 0.072). Using the clinical Montreal classification for lesion location, no significant differences emerged between the two patient populations. MRI showed a significantly higher prevalence of rectal involvement and perianal disease in the pediatric population.

However, none has been successfully developed for distal pancreatectomy. This study aimed to develop and validate a new fistula risk score for distal pancreatectomy. Methods Patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy at Helsinki University Hospital, Finland from 2013 to 2021, and at Karolinska University Hospital, Sweden, from 2010 to 2020, were included retrospectively. The outcome was CR-POPF, according to the 2016 International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery definition. Preoperative clinical demographics and radiological parameters such as pancreatic thickness and duct diameter were measured. A logistic regression model was developed, internally validated with bootstrapping, and the performance assessed in an external validation cohort. Results Of 668 patients from Helsinki (266) and Stockholm (402), 173 (25.9 per cent) developed CR-POPF. The final model consisted of three variables assessed before surgery: transection site (neck versus body/tail), pancreatic thickness at transection site, and diabetes. The model had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.904 (95 per cent c.i. 0.855 to 0.949) after internal validation, and 0.798 (0.748 to 0.848) after external validation. The calibration slope and intercept on external validation were 0.719 and 0.192 respectively. Four risk groups were defined in the validation cohort for clinical applicability: low (below 5 per cent), moderate (at least 5 but below 30 per cent), high (at least 30 but below 75 per cent), and extreme (75 per cent or more). The incidences in these groups were 8.7 per cent (11 of 126), 22.0 per cent (36 of 164), 63 per cent (57 of 91), and 81 per cent (17 of 21) respectively.

In this study, we proposed an open natural language processing development framework. We evaluated it through the implementation of NLP algorithms for the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). Based on the interests in information extraction from COVID-19 related clinical notes, our work includes 1) an open data annotation process using COVID-19 signs and symptoms as the use case, 2) a community-driven ruleset composing platform, and 3) a synthetic text data generation workflow to generate texts for information extraction tasks without involving human subjects. The corpora were derived from texts from three different institutions (Mayo Clinic, University of Kentucky, University of Minnesota). The gold standard annotations were tested with a single institution's (Mayo) ruleset. This resulted in performances of 0.876, 0.706, and 0.694 in F-scores for Mayo, Minnesota, and Kentucky test datasets, respectively. The study as a consortium effort of the N3C NLP subgroup demonstrates the feasibility of creating a federated NLP algorithm development and benchmarking platform to enhance multi-institution clinical NLP study and adoption. Although we use COVID-19 as a use case in this effort, our framework is general enough to be applied to other domains of interest in clinical NLP.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>The aim of this study is to investigate the main factors that influence the recurrence of anal fistulas in patients with perianal abscesses following incision and drainage treatment.<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective case-control study was performed according to the STROBE guidelines for patients with perianal abscesses who underwent surgical treatment at Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine in Zhuhai and at the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University in Lasso between June 2021 and June 2023. Lasso and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to further determine the recurrence of perianal abscesses.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 435 patients were included in the study, with a median follow-up period of 25 months (range 18-40 months) after receiving treatment for perianal abscesses. Of these patients, 27 were in the anal fistula group and 408 were in the cured group. The results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that a history of abscesses, enteritis, intraoperative pus cavity residue, standardized dressing changes after discharge, the surgeon's specialty, preoperative ultrasound or MRI examination, Parks classification and Wexner score were independently influential factors in the formation of anal fistulas after perianal abscess surgery (<i>P</i> < 0.05).<h4>Conclusion</h4>A history of abscesses and enteritis, Parks classification, and intraoperative pus cavity residue are high-risk factors for anal fistula recurrence. Standardized dressing changes after discharge, a preoperative ultrasound or MRI scan, and a postoperative assessment of anal function (Wexner score) are important for protecting anal sphincter function and improving the prognosis of perianal abscesses.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Introduction</h4>Delayed wound healing (DWH) following anal fistula surgery is a common complication that prolongs recovery, increases patient morbidity, and imposes significant healthcare costs. Potential risk factors such as diabetes, smoking, fistula complexity, and surgical techniques have been suggested in individual studies, yet no comprehensive synthesis exists to guide clinical practice. This study aims to identify and evaluate risk factors associated with DWH after anal fistula surgery by combining existing evidence and grading the evidence.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>This study will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines. We will search PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and grey literature databases from inception to March 2025, with no language restrictions. Observational studies (cohort and case-control) reporting risk factors for DWH, defined as incomplete healing beyond 6-12 weeks post-surgery, will be included. Two independent reviewers will screen titles/abstracts, perform full-text reviews, extract data regarding study design, sample size, risk factors and outcomes, and assess risk of bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Primary outcomes will include odds ratios (OR) or relative risks (RR) for factors such as comorbidities, lifestyle factors, and operative approaches. A random-effects meta-analysis will pool effect estimates if heterogeneity (I² < 50%) permits; otherwise, a narrative synthesis will be conducted. Subgroup analyses will explore differences by study design and patient characteristics, with publication bias assessed using funnel plots and Egger's test. The certainty of evidence will be evaluated with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.<h4>Discussion</h4>This study's strengths include its comprehensive search strategy and rigorous methodology, providing a robust synthesis of risk factors. Clinically, identifying modifiable risk factors could enhance preoperative optimization and postoperative care, reducing delayed healing rates. Future studies should standardize definitions of delayed healing and explore under-investigated factors like wound care techniques or microbiome influences to refine risk prediction models.<h4>Registration</h4>PROSPERO CRD420251013602.",

      "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives</b>: In 2019, the European Society of Gynaecological Oncology (ESGO) published a set of quality indicators (QIs) for the surgical management of cervical cancer with the aim of improving clinical practice. The objective of this study is to evaluate the influence of ESGO QIs and clinicopathological factors on progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with early-stage cervical cancer in a retrospective cohort. <b>Methods</b>: A retrospective study was conducted in patients with early-stage cervical cancer who underwent radical surgery with pelvic lymph node assessment at La Paz University Hospital between 2005 and 2022. The cohort was divided into two groups according to the timing of surgery (before vs. after 2010), when MRI was implemented as a standardized diagnostic tool and the multidisciplinary tumor board was established. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed, including demographic and histopathological variables, as well as adherence to ESGO QIs, focusing on those related to the overall management. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated and compared between groups. <b>Results</b>: The implementation of systematic MRI and a multidisciplinary tumor board at our center was associated with a significant reduction in positive surgical margins (<i>p</i> = 0.003) and parametrial invasion (<i>p</i> < 0.001), as well as improved diagnostic accuracy, lowering the rate of upstaging from 31.6% before 2010 to 4.4% thereafter (<i>p</i> < 0.001). PFS in the post-2010 cohort was significantly improved (log-rank <i>p</i> = 0.0408), although no differences in overall survival (OS) were observed (log-rank <i>p</i> = 0.2602). Additionally, cervical conization prior to radical hysterectomy was associated with a markedly reduced risk of recurrence (HR 0.12, <i>p</i> < 0.001), representing the most significant prognostic factor for PFS in our cohort. <b>Conclusions</b>: The correct application of ESGO QIs, along with appropriate staging and pathological assessment, is essential to improve prognosis in cervical cancer. Systematic implementation of these standards is recommended to optimize clinical care.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Purpose</h4>This study was conducted to evaluate the validity of a new imaging-guided, anatomy-based classification of anorectal fistulas in defining disease severity and predicting surgical outcomes.<h4>Methods</h4>This multicenter, retrospective cohort study analyzed data from patients with perianal fistulas who underwent surgery between 2017 and 2023. All patients underwent preoperative 3-dimensional endoanal ultrasound, with adjunctive magnetic resonance imaging performed if ultrasound indicated a complex fistula. Imaging examinations were retrospectively evaluated to categorize fistulas according to the Garg classification and the newly proposed classification system. The new classification included 6 severity grades based on the characteristics of the primary tract: submucosal, intersphincteric, low transsphincteric, high transsphincteric, multiple, and suprasphincteric/extrasphincteric. Each grade was further subdivided into 3 subtypes (A, B, C) based on the extension of secondary tracts.<h4>Results</h4>When compared with the new classification, the Garg classification demonstrated a slightly lower ability to predict the feasibility of fistulotomy in simple fistulas (94.2% vs 99.1%; Fisher exact test, P=0.006). A strong positive correlation was found between the surgery failure rate and the severity grade of the new classification (Spearman rho, 0.90; P<0.001), whereas the Garg classification showed a nonsignificant positive correlation with surgical failure rate (Spearman rho, 0.90; P=0.08).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The new imaging-guided, anatomy-based classification of anorectal fistulas demonstrates high accuracy in defining disease severity. It represents a valuable tool for preoperative grading of anal fistulas, standardizing the reporting of diagnostic imaging, and improving the communication of findings among healthcare professionals.",

Data from hospital clinical records and coding databases were retrospectively reviewed from a tertiary care hospital in Christchurch, New Zealand. The study included 75 adult patients with perianal Crohn's disease commenced on anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha therapy from January 2000 to December 2012. Response to treatment was determined from records relating to clinical evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging follow-up and whether further surgical intervention was required. 73% (55) of all patients and 38 of the 57 (67%) patients with perianal fistulas responded to anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha therapy. Patients with complex fistulas were less likely to improve as compared to patients without fistulising disease. Five of the 57 (13%) patients with perianal fistulas demonstrated complete healing on clinical evaluation; however, magnetic resonance imaging confirmed complete healing in only two. Patients that had taken antibiotics and those that had previously required abscess drainage were less likely to respond to treatment [relative risk (RR) = 0.707 and 0.615, respectively; p = 0.03, p = 0.0001]. Responders were less likely to require follow-up surgery (RR = 0.658, p = 0.014) including ileostomy or proctectomy. Although anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha tends to improve symptoms of perianal Crohn's disease, in the long term, it rarely achieves complete healing. Perianal fistulising disease, a history of perianal abscess and antibiotic treatment are predictors of poor response to therapy.",

It has been reported that smoking, obesity, and previous attempts at repair adversely affect the outcome of transanal advancement flap repair. Because these findings could not be confirmed by other studies, it is still unclear whether these and other factors have an impact on the outcome. The aim of this study was to identify predictors of outcome in a large cohort of patients who underwent transanal advancement flap repair for a high transsphincteric fistula. This study was performed as a retrospective review. The study was conducted at the Division of Colon and Rectal Surgery, Erasmus MC, between 2000 and 2012. A consecutive series of 252 patients with a high transsphincteric fistula of cryptoglandular origin were included. Patients with a rectovaginal or Crohn fistula were excluded. All patients underwent transanal advancement flap repair. Preoperatively, patients underwent endoanal MRI. Healing was defined as complete wound healing with absence of symptoms. Patients were followed up to assess failure. Seventeen patient- and fistula-related variables were assessed. Median duration of follow-up was 21 months (range, 6-136 months). The failure rate at 3 years was 41% (95% CI, 34-48). None of the studied variables predicted the outcome of flap repair except horseshoe extension. In univariate and multivariate analyses, significantly less failures were observed in patients with a horseshoe extension (p < 0.05). Retrospective design, a single surgeon series, and potential selection bias caused by the tertiary referral center status are the limitations of this study. Of all studied variables, horseshoe extension was found to be the only positive predictor of outcome after flap repair for high transsphincteric fistulas.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment of complex perianal fistula is technically challenging, associated with risk of failure, and may require multiple procedures. In recent years, several biologic agents have been developed for permanently eradicating anal fistulous disease with variable success. In this study, the treatment is an autologous whole-blood product created from the patients’ blood. It forms a provisional matrix that was found to be safe and effective in healing acute and chronic cutaneous wounds. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of an autologous blood clot product as a treatment for transsphincteric perianal fistulas. DESIGN: A prospective single-arm study. SETTINGS: A single tertiary medical center. PATIENTS: Patients with simple or complex transsphincteric fistulas confirmed by MRI were included in the study. Cause was either cryptoglandular or Crohn’s disease related (in the absence of active luminal bowel disease). INTERVENTION: The outpatient procedure was performed under general anesthesia and consisted of: 1) physical debridement and cleansing of the fistula tract; 2) suture closure of the internal opening; and 3) instillation of the autologous blood clot product into the entire tract. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Safety and efficacy at 6- and 12-months after surgery. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients (77% men) with a median age of 42 (20–72) years were included in the study. Three patients withdrew consent, and 1 patient was lost to follow-up. At the time of this interim analysis, 49 and 33 patients completed the 6- and 12-month follow-up period. Thirty-four of the 49 patients achieved complete healing (69%) at 6 months, but 20 of the 33 patients (60%) achieved healing after 1 year. All patients who achieved healing at 6 months remained healed at the 1-year mark. In a subgroup analysis of patients with Crohn’s disease, 7 of 9 patients completed 1-year follow-up, with 5 patients (71%) achieving clinical remission. No major side effects or postoperative complications were noted, but 2 adverse events occurred (admission for pain control and coronavirus 2019 infection). LIMITATIONS: Noncomparative single-arm pilot study. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with an autologous blood clot product in perianal fistular disease was found to be feasible and safe, with an acceptable healing rate in both cryptoglandular and Crohn’s disease fistula-in-ano. Further comparative assessment is required to determine its potential role in the treatment paradigm of fistula-in-ano. See Video Abstract. BRAZO PARA EVALUAR LA SEGURIDAD Y EFICACIA DE RD2-VER.02, UN COÁGULO DE SANGRE AUTÓLOGO, EN EL TRATAMIENTO DE LA FÍSTULA ANAL ANTECEDENTES: El tratamiento quirúrgico de la fístula perianal compleja es técnicamente desafiante, se asocia con riesgo de fracaso y puede requerir múltiples procedimientos. En los últimos años, se han desarrollado varios agentes biológicos con el fin de erradicar permanentemente la enfermedad fistulosa anal con éxito variable. El tratamiento RD2-Ver.02 es un producto de sangre total autólogo creado a partir de la sangre de los pacientes, que forma una matriz provisional que resultó segura y eficaz para curar heridas cutáneas agudas y crónicas. OBJETIVO: Evaluar la eficacia y seguridad de RD2-Ver.02 como tratamiento para las fístulas perianales transesfinterianas. DISEÑO: Un estudio prospectivo de un solo brazo. LUGARES: Un único centro médico terciario. PACIENTES: Se incluyeron en el estudio pacientes con fístulas transesfinterianas simples o complejas confirmadas mediante resonancia magnética. La etiología fue criptoglandular o relacionada con la enfermedad de Crohn (en ausencia de enfermedad intestinal luminal activa). INTERVENCIÓN: El procedimiento ambulatorio se realizó bajo anestesia general y consistió en: 1) desbridamiento físico y limpieza del trayecto fistuloso; 2) cierre con sutura de la abertura interna; y 3) instilación de RD2-Ver.02 en todo el tracto. PRINCIPALES MEDIDAS DE VALORACIÓN: Seguridad y eficacia a los 6 y 12 meses después de la cirugía. RESULTADOS: Se incluyeron en el estudio 53 pacientes (77% varones) con una mediana de edad de 42 (20-72) años. Tres pacientes retiraron su consentimiento y un paciente se perdió durante el seguimiento. En el momento de este análisis intermedio, 49 y 33 pacientes completaron el período de seguimiento de 6 y 12 meses, respectivamente. Treinta y cuatro (34) pacientes lograron una curación completa (69%) a los 6 meses, mientras que 20 de 33 pacientes (60%) lograron una curación después de un año. Todos los pacientes que lograron la curación a los 6 meses permanecieron curados al año. En un análisis de subgrupos de pacientes con enfermedad de Crohn, 7/9 pacientes completaron un seguimiento de un año y 5 pacientes (71%) alcanzaron la remisión clínica. No se observaron efectos secundarios importantes ni complicaciones postoperatorias, mientras que ocurrieron 2 eventos adversos (ingreso para control del dolor e infección por COVID-19). LIMITACIONES: Estudio piloto no comparativo de un solo brazo. CONCLUSIONES: Se encontró que el tratamiento con RD2-Ver.02 en la enfermedad fístula perianal es factible y seguro, con una tasa de curación aceptable tanto en la fístula criptoglandular como en la de Crohn en el ano. Se requiere una evaluación comparativa adicional para determinar su papel potencial en el paradigma de tratamiento de la fístula anal.

We aimed to assess this risk.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic literature search was conducted to identify cohort studies on the incidence of relapse following anti-TNF discontinuation in pCD patients. Individual participant data were requested from the original study cohorts. Inclusion criteria were age ≥16 years, pCD as a (co)indication for start of anti-TNF therapy, more than three doses, and remission of luminal and pCD at anti-TNF discontinuation. The primary outcome was the cumulative incidence of CD relapse using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Secondary outcomes included response to re-treatment and risk factors associated with relapse as assessed by Cox regression analysis.<h4>Results</h4>In total, 309 patients from 12 studies in ten countries were included. The median duration of anti-TNF treatment was 14 months [interquartile range 5.8-32.5]. Most patients were treated for pCD without active luminal disease [89%], received first-line anti-TNF therapy [87%], and continued immunomodulatory therapy following anti-TNF discontinuation [78%]. The overall cumulative incidence of relapse was 36% (95% confidence interval [CI] 25-48%) and 42% [95% CI 32-53%] at 1 and 2 years after anti-TNF discontinuation, respectively. Risk factors for relapse included smoking (hazard ratio [HR] 1.5 [1.0, 2.1]) and history of proctitis (HR 1.7 [1.1, 2.5]). The overall re-treatment response rate was 82%.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This individual participant data meta-analysis, on predominantly patients with pCD without active luminal disease and first-line anti-TNF therapy, shows that over half of patients remain in remission 2 years after anti-TNF discontinuation. Therefore, anti-TNF discontinuation may be considered in this subgroup.",

This review explores biochemical properties and physiological roles of albumin, its place in nutritional assessment, current understanding of perturbed circulating concentrations, and role in clinical management, with special focus on patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).<h4>Methods</h4>A detailed literature search was performed.<h4>Results</h4>Albumin is synthesized by hepatocytes and comprises 3% of total body protein. It has a prolonged intravascular half-life (17-19 h) due to neonatal Fc-receptor-mediated salvage and has a multitude of physiological functions. Albumin homeostasis is affected in disease states often resulting in reduced level, which is not a direct marker of malnutrition. In patients with IBD, morbid albumin concentrations provide prognostic information, identification of nonintestinal conditions, guidance to the required aggressiveness of therapy and biologic dosage, monitoring of disease activity, and potential need for therapeutic escalation. Barriers to utilization of morbid albumin levels include the lack of consensus regarding cutoff values and the deficiency of high-quality data in this domain due to the retrospective design of the majority of studies. Serum levels hold greatest clinical potential in prognostication in acute severe ulcerative colitis. The premorbid level in the individual may provide insight into dosing of biologics and potentially enhance interpretation of morbid levels.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Understanding the physiology and pathophysiology of albumin is fundamental to interpreting its circulating levels. The clinical value of its measurement in patients with IBD may be undervalued, as it assists in evaluation of disease severity, prognosis, and therapeutic decision-making.",

      "abstract": "Disease activity evaluation is important in Crohn's disease (CD). We aimed to establish new disease activity indices for CD based on noninvasive parameters. The data of 110 patients with CD were retrospectively analyzed. Parameters from bowel ultrasound and biomarkers were measured to select the variables included in the models by univariate analysis. Logistic regression analysis was performed to predict mucosal and transmural activities defined by ileocolonoscopy or computed tomography enterography, respectively. The models' performance was measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) was applied to adjust for overconfidence in the newly established score models. To predict mucosal activity, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and (LimG × BWT)-SUM (the sum of the product of Limberg grade [LimG] and bowel wall thickness [BWT] of each bowel segment) were selected for model A, and the equation was A = 2 × ESR + 9.3 × (LimG × BWT)-SUM. The AUC of ROC, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.927%, 89.8%, and 86.4%, respectively. The AUC of the ROC curve verified by LOOCV was 0.913. To predict transmural activity, albumin (ALB) and LimG-SUM (the sum of the LimG of all the bowel segments) were selected for model B, which was established as B = -1.3 × ALB +1.7 × LimG-SUM. The AUC of ROC, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.851%, 78.0%, and 84.2%, respectively. The AUC of the ROC curve verified by LOOCV was 0.833. Nomograms were developed for two score models. New score models based on noninvasive parameters established in this study showed good abilities in detecting active disease and performed well in the validation phase.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Introduction</h4>Crohn's disease (CD) is characterised by discontinuous, relapsing enteric inflammation. Instituting advanced therapies at an early stage to suppress inflammation aims to prevent future complications such as stricturing or penetrating disease, and subsequent surgical resection. Therapeutics are effective but associated with certain side-effects and relatively expensive. There is therefore an urgent need for robust methods to predict which newly diagnosed patients will develop disabling disease, to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from early, advanced therapies. We aim to determine if magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) features at diagnosis improve prediction of disabling CD within 5 years of diagnosis.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>We describe the protocol for a multicentre, non-randomised, single-arm, prospective study of adult patients with newly diagnosed CD. We will use patients already recruited to the METRIC study and extend their clinical follow-up, as well as a separate group of newly diagnosed patients who were not part of the METRIC trial (MRE within 3 months of diagnosis), to ensure an adequate sample size. Follow-up will extend for at least 4 years. The primary outcome is to evaluate the comparative predictive ability of prognostic models incorporating MRE severity scores (Magnetic resonance Enterography Global Score (MEGS), simplified MAgnetic Resonance Index of Activity (sMaRIA) and Lémann Index) versus models using standard characteristics alone to predict disabling CD (modified Beaugerie definition) within 5 years of new diagnosis.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>This study protocol achieved National Health Service Research Ethics Committee (NHS REC), London-Hampstead Research Ethics Committee approval (IRAS 217422). Our findings will be disseminated via conference presentations and peer-reviewed publications.<h4>Trial registration number</h4>ISRCTN76899103.",

      "abstract": "Objective Transmural healing (TH) has been attracting attention as a new therapeutic target for Crohn's disease, but there are few clinical data on TH in Japan. We introduced low-dose computed tomography enterography (CTE) as a monitoring method for Crohn's disease and retrospectively investigated the accuracy of evaluating TH by CTE. Methods Among Crohn's disease patients who underwent low-dose CTE at our hospital from January 2009 to March 2021, 122 patients who underwent colonoscopy or balloon endoscopy within 2 weeks were included. Results of radiological and endoscopic examinations were reviewed independently by radiologists and gastrointestinal endoscopists, respectively. The concordance rate of the diagnosis between CTE and endoscopy was evaluated. Results Twenty-six patients (21.3%) achieved TH, and the kappa index was 0.743. On comparing the TH and non-TH groups, the Crohn's disease activity index (p=0.02), endoscopic healing rate (p<0.001), serum albumin (p=0.043), and serum C-reactive protein level (p=0.018) showed significant differences. Among the 122 patients, 69 (56.5%) showed concordance between the diagnosis of CTE and endoscopy, and 22 (18.0%) achieved both TH and endoscopic healing. Conclusion This study provides real-world data on Crohn's disease evaluated with low-dose CTE in Japan. The TH criterion used in this study has a high kappa coefficient and can be used reproducibly in many institutions.",

This study aimed to assess therapeutic safety and feasibility in the completed STOMP (stem cells on matrix plugs) phase 1 clinical trial. Prospective single-arm phase I clinical trial. Tertiary academic medical center. Adults (aged 18-65 y) with complex single-tract Crohn's disease perianal fistula who have failed conventional therapy were included in this study. Autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells were isolated, ex vivo culture expanded, and seeded onto a commercially available bioabsorbable fistula plug. Six weeks later, patients returned to the operating room for removal of the seton and placement of the stem cell-loaded plug. Patients were followed up for a total of 8 visits through 12 months. Safety was the primary end point; clinical healing and MRI response were secondary end points. Twenty patients (12 females; mean age 36 y) were treated with the stem cell-loaded plug. Of the 20 patients enrolled, 3 were not included in the 12-month analysis because of study withdrawal. Through 12 months, no patient experienced a serious adverse event related to the stem cell-loaded plug. Four patients experienced 7 serious adverse events and 12 patients experienced 22 adverse events. Complete clinical healing occurred in 14 of 18 patients at 6 months and 13 of 17 patients at 12 months. MRI response was observed in 12 of 18 patients at 6 months.

They have negative effects on patients’ quality of life and the risk of anal cancer (AC) is two to three times higher than the general population. The management of perianal disease (pCD) often includes a local approach but also a systemic therapeutic escalation.\n \n \n \n Aim: to evaluate the response to therapy and the incidence of AC in patients with pCD. Retrospective single-centre study, recruiting all adult patients with pCD. We analysed the population demography, extraintestinal manifestations, the presence of perianal disease at diagnosis, the subtype of pCD, PDAI score, baseline treatment and the need for readjustment. We evaluated the clinical and MRI response atsix months, further therapeutic changes required, the incidence of anal and rectal cancer and the status at last follow-up.\n \n \n \n 174 patients with CD, 50 with pCD (29%) – from these: 59% Male; Age 22-77 (median 51); Extraintestinal manifestations 16 (31%); pCD at the diagnosis of CD 29 (57%). pCD characterization: fistula 46 (92%) (simple 6; complex 40); abscess 27 (54%); fissure 12 (24%). PDAI score: 1-17 (median 7,5). Approach: fistulotomy 25 (49%); seton placement 13 (25%); protective stoma 5 (9,8%). Antibiotics in 43 (86%). Therapeutic change 40 (84%) -started: corticosteroid course 9 (18%) (all with rectal disease activity), anti-TNF 28 (55%), thiopurine 23 (45%) 13 of them in monotherapy. At 6 months: global clinical improvement 41 (81%); healed PD 18 (35%). Follow up 2-49 years (mean 20); Subsequent treatment change during follow up: 28 (55%). At last follow-up: luminal CD in clinical remission 44 (86%); pCD improvement 43 (84%) and deep remission in 32 (64%). By univariate analysis there was no significant association between starting anti-TNF therapy or monotherapy with thiopurine and clinical response at 6 months, or at last follow up, with MRI improvement. During follow up, 3 patients (6%) develop AC (2 perianal fistula-related cancer; 1 adenocarcinoma). There was no significant association with the use of anti-TNF (p 0,356) or thiopurine (p 0,312) but there was an association with absence of clinical response at 6 months (p 0,050) and lack of MRI improvement (p 0,057). There were no rectal cancer cases.\n \n \n \n Most patients with pCD required therapeutic changes, the majority of them initiating anti-TNF – this resulted in luminal disease remission and at least pCD improvement in more than 80% of patients. The small sample size limited our results, but AC seemed to be more common in patients with chronically active pCD.\n",

New therapeutic alternatives are needed, particularly in anti-TNF refractory patients. Data regarding ustekinumab (UST) effectiveness in pCD are scarce. Our aim was to evaluate the clinical and radiologic effectiveness of UST in pCD patients refractory or intolerant to anti-TNF.\n \n \n \n We conducted a multi-center retrospective observational study. All patients with anti-TNF refractory pCD treated with UST were evaluated. Demographic and clinical variables including concomitant drugs were registered. Clinical response was evaluated at 16 weeks and 12 months and was defined as a reduction of 50% of draining fistulas or a marked reduction in fistula drainage. In patients with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before and after treatment initiation, radiologic response was defined according to Ng Score (healed, partial response, unchanged, deterioration).\n \n \n \n Thirty-two patients were included, 68.8% female, median age 44,11 (IQR 36.28-48.56). Median time from diagnosis to UST initiation was 12.94 years (IQR 7.52-19.52), 90.6% had received previously 2 anti-TNF (37.5% also vedolizumab) and 46.9% had more than 2 fistulas. In 22 patients (68.8%) pCD was the main indication for UST treatment while in the remaining 31.2% the main indication was luminal disease. Fifteen patients (46.9%) received antibiotics at the initiation of UST, 8 (25%) combo therapy with thiopurines and 21 (65.6%) had setons. Patients received a 6mg/kg IV dose and 87.5% received 90mg/8 week SQ for maintenance. Dose intensification was needed in 20 patients (62.5%) at a median of 13 months (IQR 8.00-19.5). Fifteen patients (46,9%) achieved clinical response at week 16, while 18/30 (60%) had clinical response at 12 months (three of them were in clinical remission). Nineteen patients (59,4%) had an MRI performed pre and post-treatment at a median of 15 months (IQR 10-19). 10/19 patients (52.6%) achieved a radiological response although no patient had all fistulas healed. In the multivariate analysis the only factor associated with clinical response at 12 months was the presence of setons at UST initiation (OR 7.0; IC95% 1.3-37.9). There were no factors significantly associated with radiological response or clinical response at week 16. Four patients experienced adverse effects (three perianal abscesses and one transient skin rash).\n \n \n \n Ustekinumab was effective in achieving clinical and radiological response in anti-TNF-refractory fistulising pCD patients, although clinical and radiological remission was rare. Most patients needed UST dose intensification in this highly refractory cohort. Adverse effects were infrequent, mainly perianal abscesses.\n",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Diagnosing perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease (pfCD) typically depends on costly and time-intensive endoscopic and radiographic procedures. Compelling evidence indicates that neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) plays a role in the pathophysiology of Crohn's disease (CD) and may serve as a noninvasive biomarker for its diagnosis. This study aimed to evaluate NGAL's potential as a noninvasive diagnostic biomarker between pfCD and cryptoglandular (CG) perianal fistula, and its correlation with disease severity in pfCD.<h4>Methods</h4>Serum, fecal, and fistula tissue samples were collected from 96 patients with pfCD and 97 patients with CG perianal fistula as controls. Serum NGAL levels were quantified through ELISA and fistula tissue NGAL levels were quantified through immunohistochemical staining, while pfCD disease severity was evaluated using the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and Perianal Disease Activity Index (PDAI). Additional laboratory parameters, including NGAL, fecal calprotectin (FC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), were analyzed, and their correlations were assessed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted to evaluate NGAL's diagnostic potential for pfCD.<h4>Results</h4>Levels of serum NGAL, FC, CRP, and ESR in patients with pfCD were significantly elevated compared to the control group (<i>p</i> < 0.001); Spearman correlation analysis indicated a positive correlation between serum NGAL and FC, CRP, ESR, CDAI, and PDAI scores. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for serum NGAL in diagnosing pfCD was 0.927 (95% <i>CI</i>: 0.890-0.964). The AUC for FC in diagnosing pfCD were 0.887 (95% <i>CI</i>: 0.839-0.935). Additionally, serum and fistula tissue NGAL levels were positively correlated with disease complexity in pfCD according to the Montreal classification.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These findings suggest that serum NGAL is associated with pfCD severity and may offer a promising noninvasive biomarker for diagnosing and assessing pfCD.",

Literature regarding the influence of tumor volume, location, and patient age on surgical outcomes and survival is limited and inconclusive. This study addresses these gaps, evaluating the combined impact of these variables on APA prognosis and management. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 32 adult patients with surgically treated APA at our institution (2014-2023), examining demographics, imaging, histology, and outcomes. Results Mean age was 35.8 years (SD 11.6); 59% were male. Median Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) at admission was 90% (range 50-100%). Infratentorial tumors (56%) correlated significantly with lower KPS, increased cranial nerve deficits, cerebellar symptoms, hydrocephalus risk, prolonged operative time, higher CSF leaks (11%), and frequent revision surgeries. Gross total resection was achieved less frequently in infratentorial (33%) compared to supratentorial tumors (43%). Overall recurrence rate was 50%, strongly predicted by higher Ki-67 proliferation indices (p < 0.05), whereas resection extent alone lacked significant correlation. BRAF mutations occurred in only 38% of recurrent cases, highlighting APA's distinct molecular profile. Five-year mortality was 6%, exclusively in High-Grade Astrocytoma with Piloid Features (HGAP). Conclusion Our findings challenge assumptions of benign clinical courses for APAs. Infratentorial tumors present increased surgical challenges and require tailored management. With recurrence rates of 50% and Ki-67 as a key prognostic marker, APA treatment demands personalized, biomarker-guided strategies beyond conventional surgical approaches.",

      "abstract": "Clinical trials are critical in advancing medical treatments but often suffer from immense time and financial burden. Advances in statistical methodologies and artificial intelligence (AI) present opportunities to address these inefficiencies. Here we introduce Prognostic Covariate-Adjusted Mixed Models for Repeated Measures (PROCOVA-MMRM) as an advantageous combination of prognostic covariate adjustment (PROCOVA) and Mixed Models for Repeated Measures (MMRM). PROCOVA-MMRM utilizes time-matched prognostic scores generated from AI models to enhance the precision of treatment effect estimators for longitudinal continuous outcomes, enabling reductions in sample size and enrollment times. We first provide a description of the background and implementation of PROCOVA-MMRM, followed by two case study reanalyses where we compare the performance of PROCOVA-MMRM versus the unadjusted MMRM. These reanalyses demonstrate significant improvements in statistical power and precision in clinical indications with unmet medical need, specifically Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). We also explore the potential for sample size reduction with the prospective implementation of PROCOVA-MMRM, finding that the same or better results could have been achieved with fewer participants in these historical trials if the enhanced precision provided by PROCOVA-MMRM had been prospectively leveraged. We also confirm the robustness of the statistical properties of PROCOVA-MMRM in a variety of realistic simulation scenarios. Altogether, PROCOVA-MMRM represents a rigorous method of incorporating advances in the prediction of time-matched prognostic scores generated by AI into longitudinal analysis, potentially reducing both the cost and time required to bring new treatments to patients while adhering to regulatory standards.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Introduction</h4>Perianal Crohn's disease (CD) remains challenging to treat despite the increasing number of advanced therapies. Advanced dual-targeted therapy has emerged as a new treatment option in CD, but no data are available for perianal CD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of advanced dual-targeted therapy for anoperineal fistulas (APFs) in CD patients.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>We prospectively included all consecutive patients receiving an advanced dual-targeted therapy for APFs from August 2019 to December 2023 in a single tertiary perianal CD centre. The primary outcome was clinical effectiveness. Secondary outcomes were patients' treatment perception, radiological effectiveness, luminal disease effectiveness, impact on extra-intestinal manifestations, and safety. Factors associated with complete clinical remission of APFs were identified using logistic regression.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 33 patients were included. The most frequently used advanced dual-targeted therapy was a combination of infliximab and ustekinumab (75.8%). After a median follow-up of 27.4 months, 48.5% and 97.0% of patients were in complete clinical remission and reported a perceived improvement, respectively. Complete radiological remission was achieved in 24.2% of the patients. A concomitant improvement in luminal intestinal involvement was observed in 46.1% of cases, and in extra-digestive manifestations in 45.8% of cases. Treatment tolerance was considered good or very good in 90.9% of cases. Associated anal ulcers and long-term exposure to antibiotics were associated with a lower likelihood of complete clinical remission for fistulas.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These findings suggest that advanced dual-targeted therapy is a valid option with a good safety profile for the treatment of refractory APFs. Larger studies are required to identify the most effective combination.",

      "abstract": "Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has proved useful in the evaluation of perianal and perirectal lesions resulting from Crohn disease. On T1-weighted MR images, sinus tracts and fistulas are hypointense due to their fluid content; on T2-weighted images, their signal intensity depends on their fluid content and the degree of surrounding fibrosis. Other pathologic entities, such as abscesses in the ischioanal fossa, may become evident at MR imaging even though they remain hidden at digital examination. Rectal wall thickening and perirectal inflammatory changes are often seen at MR imaging of the pelvis. The multiplanar capability of MR imaging greatly facilitates the detection of fistulous tracts that extend into the supralevator space. MR imaging can be helpful to both the surgeon and the gastroenterologist in the assessment of perianal and perirectal complications arising from Crohn disease and, when necessary, in the planning of surgical intervention. MR imaging also recommends itself to the patient because it is noninvasive and does not cause discomfort.",

By addressing challenges such as incontinence and relapse associated with recurrent fistulas, the study aims to demonstrate how the IFTAK approach, with its sphincter-sparing and healing-promoting properties, offers an effective and sustainable solution for better management and reduced recurrence rates.<h4>Methods</h4>This retrospective study involved 10 patients with recurrent fistula-in-ano, consecutively selected on the basis of the date of intervention and treated using the IFTAK technique. Preoperative imaging and clinical assessments identified the fistulous tract. Intraoperatively, the tract was intercepted at the inter-sphincteric plane, followed by Ksharasutra application. Postoperative care included sitz baths, dressing changes, and weekly thread replacement until healing.<h4>Results</h4>Among 10 patients (8 males, 2 females; average age 39 years), cut-through was achieved in 2-3 months, depending on the fistula complexity. Weekly follow-ups ensured healing, with no recurrence observed in 10 patients over 12 months (1 year).<h4>Conclusion</h4>IFTAK is a minimally invasive and effective technique for managing complex and recurrent fistula-in-ano, offering reduced recurrence, sphincter preservation, and faster recovery.

      "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Crohn's disease (CD) requires precise, noninvasive monitoring to guide therapy and support treat-to-target management. Magnetic resonance enterography (MRE), particularly diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), is the preferred cross-sectional technique for assessing small-bowel inflammation. Indices such as the Magnetic Resonance Index of Activity (MaRIA) and its diffusion-weighted variant (DWI MaRIA) are widely used for grading disease activity. This study evaluated whether unsupervised clustering of MRI-derived features can complement these indices by providing more coherent and biologically grounded stratification of disease activity. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> Fifty patients with histologically confirmed CD underwent 1.5 T MRE. Of 349 bowel segments, 84 were pathological and classified using literature-based thresholds (MaRIA, DWI MaRIA) and unsupervised clustering. Differences between inactive, active, and severe disease were analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), analysis of variance (ANOVA), and <i>t</i>-tests. Mahalanobis distances were calculated to quantify and compare separation between categories. <b>Results:</b> Using MaRIA thresholds, 5, 16, and 63 segments were classified as inactive, active, and severe (Mahalanobis distances 2.60, 4.95, 4.12). Clustering redistributed them into 22, 37, and 25 (9.26, 24.22, 15.27). For DWI MaRIA, 21, 14, and 49 segments were identified under thresholds (3.59, 5.72, 2.85) versus 21, 37, and 26 with clustering (7.40, 16.35, 9.41). Wall thickness dominated cluster-derived separation, supported by diffusion metrics and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). <b>Conclusions:</b> Cluster-derived classification yielded clearer and more biologically consistent separation of disease-activity groups than fixed thresholds, emphasizing its potential to refine boundary definition, enhance MRI-based assessment, and inform future AI-driven diagnostic modeling.",

Initial spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a longitudinally extensive myelopathy. It was initially interpreted as transverse myelitis, prompting treatment with high-dose corticosteroids. However, the clinical response was minimal. Over the following months, progressive symptom worsening led to a repeat MRI, which showed interval progression of spinal cord edema and T2 hyperintensity from T6 to T12, which was indicative of chronic venous congestion without distinct flow voids. Subsequent spinal angiography confirmed a spinal dural arteriovenous fistula (SDAVF) at the T10-T11 level. The clinical course and imaging findings led to a diagnosis of venous congestive myelopathy (VCM), complicated by secondary spinal cord infarction (SCI) attributable to the SDAVF. After surgical disconnection of the fistula, the patient began intensive rehabilitation. Despite successful fistula closure, substantial residual neurological deficits persisted, likely due to irreversible damage from both chronic venous hypertension and secondary infarction, compounded by delayed diagnosis. This case underscores the importance of considering SDAVF in patients with progressive or steroid-refractory myelopathy. It also illustrates that VCM can lead to secondary infarction, complicating both diagnosis and prognosis.",

      "abstract": "Isolated bilateral thalamic congestion due to an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a rare entity. Few case reports of dural arteriovenous fistula associated with it have been reported in the literature. The association of pial arteriovenous fistula (pial AVF) with thalamic hyperintensities has never been described before. The pial AVF is a recently recognized lesion in which the multiple pial arterial feeders drain into a single venous channel without a nidus like in conventional AVM. In spite of being congenital in origin, these lesions may have expression in adulthood due to abrupt change in the venous drainage system. Successful management of pial AVF associated with bilateral thalamic hyperintensities is described here with review of the literature. A 60-year-old man presented with rapidly progressive gait disturbance and cognitive decline. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed hyperintensities in the thalami on T2-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery image. Digital subtraction angiography revealed a pial AVF near the splenium of corpus callosum. It had feeders from posterior choroidal arteries and drained into the vein of Galen through an abnormal mesencephalic vein. The stagnation and increase of pressure in the deep venous system led to congestion in the thalami. He was treated by partial transarterial embolization of the feeders followed by gamma knife therapy (GKT). The clinical symptoms and MRI improved rapidly after embolization and further reduction in shunt flow was observed after GKT. Strong suspicion of vascular malformation as a cause of bilateral thalamic hyperintensities helps in early detection. Such lesions like pial AVF presented here require active intervention by surgery or endovascular therapy. GKT is an important adjuvant in lesions refractory to either of them.",

To assess the symptoms, neurologic signs, and radiologic findings in a large series of patients with myelopathy due to spinal dural arteriovenous fistula (SDAVF). The clinical diagnosis of SDAVF is difficult because presenting symptoms and signs can be similar to those seen with spinal canal stenosis or peripheral nerve or root disorders. We reviewed 153 consecutive patients with SDAVF treated surgically at our institution between 1985 and 2008. Before surgery, all patients had detailed neurologic examination, 147 patients had spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and all but one, had spinal angiography. We evaluated associations between symptoms, physical signs, spinal cord T2 signal abnormality on MRI, and fistula level on angiogram. Mean age was 63.5 years and 119 (77.8%) were men. Weakness and sensory changes are usually symmetric and ascend from the lower extremities. Presenting symptoms included leg weakness (74 patients, 48.4%), leg sensory disturbances (41 patients, 26.8%), pain involving back or legs (31 patients, 20.3%), and sphincter disturbances (6 patients, 3.9%). Worsening weakness with exertion was present in 66 (43.1%) patients and correlated with thoracic fistula location (P=0.04). Pinprick level was identified in 57 (37.3%) patients; L1 level (22.8%) was the most common, followed by T10 (19.3%). Fistula level (±2 levels) corresponded to pinprick level in only 40% of these patients. T2 signal abnormality involved the conus in 95% of our patients. Highest cord level of T2 signal hyperintensity (±2 levels) corresponded to pinprick level in 25% of cases. Leg weakness exacerbated by exercise, likely due to worsening hypertension in the arterialized draining vein, is a common manifestation of thoracic SDAVF. Although a sensory level is often found, it cannot reliably guide the level of imaging. Thus, the entire spine should be examined with MRI when an SDAVF is suspected.",

Our aims were to evaluate the agreement between clinical examination, magnetic resonance imaging, and anal ultrasound in assessing perianal fistula activity, and to apply computerized analysis to improve the assessment of ultrasound images. Thirty-one consecutive patients with Crohn's perianal fistulas underwent clinical examination, and magnetic resonance and anal ultrasound imaging. Active fistulas were defined as the presence of active drainage or signs of local inflammation on clinical examination, and the definition was confirmed by surgical examination. Activity was assessed on the basis of T2 hyperintensity on magnetic resonance imaging and the degree of hypoechogenicity on anal ultrasound; the anal ultrasound images were also analyzed using dedicated computer image-analysis software. Twenty-five patients had an active fistula at clinical examination. The agreement between clinical examination and magnetic resonance imaging was good (k-value = 0.739), whereas that with anal ultrasound was only fair (k-value = 0.266-0.294); computer-assisted analysis of the anal ultrasound images improved the agreement from fair to good (k-value = 0.608-0.670). Anal ultrasound can be used to assess fistula track activity in patients with Crohn's disease.

      "abstract": "Cerebral DAVF is one of the vascular malformations with abnormal blood flow via arteriovenous shunts into veins, leading to venous hypertension or the obstruction of venous drainage. It may cause venous infarction and intraparenchymal or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Especially, a subsequent attack is likely to become a serious event for patients with a previous history of cerebral hemorrhage. MRI is a noninvasive tool for diagnosing DAVF. However, conventional MRI usually only shows normal findings in cases without retrograde cortical venous drainage (RCVD). In these patients with DAVF with RCVD, dilated veins can be sometimes observed on the surface of the brain on certain MRI sequences (eg, contrastenhanced T1-weighted images and susceptibility-weighted images [SWI]), and abnormal venous structures are sometimes observed on MR angiography. For those cases with subsequent ictus, various MRI signal changes can often be found, and those include subcortical edema, hemorrhage, calcification, or venous infarction. Thus, the accurate prospective diagnosis of DAVF may not be straightforward in such cases. T2*-weighted imaging (T2*WI) is an MRI sequence that enables detection of hemorrhagic lesions as hypointensity areas. The finding has been generally recognized as being caused by an accumulation of hemosiderin, which tends to last for a long period of time. However, to our knowledge, there has been no report that described the disappearance of a T2*WI finding associated with DAVF. Herein, we present a novel MRI finding, ie, gyriform hypointensity on T2*WI involving the cerebral cortex that completely vanished after successful embolization of the cerebral DAVF. This is potentially a unique sign that contributes to the accurate diagnosis of cerebral DAVF. A 48-year-oldmanwas referred to our hospital with seizures lasting for several seconds and consciousness disturbance. No other neurological deficits were noted. Brain computed tomography (CT) images showed no abnormal findings suggestive of hemorrhage or calcification (Fig. 1). T1-weighted MR images (Discovery MR750w; GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI) revealed no findings suggestive of hemorrhage (Fig. 2). Fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) images revealed hyperintensity at the subcortex of the right superior frontal gyrus. This finding was considered to correspond with subcortical edema. T2*WI showed gyriform hypointensity along the cerebral cortex (Fig. 3). The parameters of T2*WI were as follows: gradient echo, flip angle: 15 degrees, echo time: 20 msec, repetition time: 800 msec, field of view: 230 mm, slice thickness: 5.0 mm, acquisition time: 157 sec, number of slices: 24. Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images showed a dilated cortical vein in the cerebrospinal fluid space. Selective middle meningeal angiography revealed reflux of the cortical veins at the arterial phase, which is suggestive of DAVF (Borden type III, Cognard type IV) (Fig. 4). Embolization was successfully performed with n-butyl-2-cynaoacrylate (NBCA; Histoacryl, B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany). Postprocedural angiography showed the disappearance of the arteriovenous shunt. The patient’s symptoms, such as seizures, subsequently improved. MRI 3 months after embolization showed that hypointensity on T2*WI along the cortex disappeared (Fig. 5). FLAIR also revealed that the subcortex of the right superior frontal gyrus was normal. The present case report describes a novel MRI finding: hypointensity on T2*WI at the cerebral cortex due to cerebral DAVF that completely disappeared after embolization. The pathogenesis of this finding can be considered an interesting issue to be investigated. In DAVF, hypointensity on T2*WI along the cortex generally suggests the deposition of hemosiderin secondary to hemorrhage or calcification, which are irreversible in most cases. In the present case, hypointensity that matched the cortex completely disappeared after embolization. Therefore, this MRI finding was not considered to be hemorrhage or calcification. Hypointensity on T2*WI at the surface of the cortex in DAVF may be considered superficial siderosis. However, the disappearance of gyriform hypointensity within a few months was apparently inconsistent with the assumption of superficial siderosis. Regarding the similar findings to those of the present case, Hu et al reported gyriform hypointensity along the cortex on SWI in a case of Sturge–Weber syndrome. These findings corresponded to necrosis, gliosis, and cortical calcification that led by venous stasis at the cortex with underlying leptomeningeal angiomatosis. Venous stasis may induce an increase in local deoxyhemoglobin",

Here, we report the case of 84-year-old man with rapidly progressive parkinsonism and dementia who was initially treated with levodopa without any improvement.

Three-dimensional and post-contrast T1-weighted images showed a subtentorial ovalar area with venous drainage alteration, and hypertrophic left occipital artery direct to venous sac. The angiography study confirmed a diagnosis of DAVF. Endovascular treatment by cook pressure technique successfully provided fistula obliteration. The patient rapidly recovered after the endovascular treatment, with restitutio ad integrum of cognitive functioning and resolution of extrapyramidal syndrome. Approximately 1 year after the endovascular treatment, a brain MR scan with angiogram-MR sequences showed almost complete disappearance of white matter alterations on both cerebral hemispheres, and normal visualization of venous system.",

      "abstract": "Spinal dural arteriovenous fistula (SDAVF) is among the most common arterial shunt diseases typically found in middle aged or older men. Herein, we aimed to clarify the reasons for misdiagnoses and delayed diagnoses of SDAVF, determine how these affect prognoses, and establish how they can be prevented. We conducted a PubMed/MEDLINE literature search using “spinal dural arteriovenous fistula”, “delayed diagnosis”, “late diagnosis”, and “misdiagnosis” terms. We identified 18 articles, including 965 SDAVF cases. Patients were predominantly males (71.8–100.0%) (mean age: 53.5–71.0 years). Misdiagnoses rates varied (17.5–100.0%) and encompassed many conditions. The mean time between early manifestations and confirmed diagnosis was approximately 10–15 months and from the first radiologic image revealing dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) features to diagnosis was 9.2–20.7 months. Posttreatment outcomes showed a significant improvement in motor functions, gait, and micturition, particularly in patients exhibiting preoperative symptoms over a short period. SDAVF is frequently misdiagnosed or subject to delayed diagnosis, causing poor clinical outcomes. SDAVF symptoms including progressive lower-limb weakness, paresthesia, and vesicorectal dysfunction are indications for spinal magnetic resonance imaging with subsequent spinal angiography, wherein DAVF is evidenced by extensive T2 hyperintensity and flow-void abnormalities. We reported a representative case with delayed diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n        Purpose: The non-enhancing T2-FLAIR hyperintensity lesions at a distance from the enhancing tumor site at baseline have been observed of neoplastic nature in primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSL). Our aim was to explore the incidence, location, and morphology of the non-enhancing T2-FLAIR hyperintensity lesions in PCNSL.Methods: We retrospectively reviewed patients diagnosed with immunocompetent PCNSL at our institution. We identified and evaluated the T2-FLAIR hyperintensity lesions without enhancement that markedly decrease or disappear in the MRI after treatment. MRI characteristics of PCNSL at initial presentation were analyzed and compared between patients with non-enhancing T2-FLAIR hyperintensity lesions and patients without these lesions.Results: Among 89 patients, 10 patients (11.2%) were found to have non-enhancing T2-FLAIR hyperintensity lesions at a distance from the enhancing tumor site at baseline, that showed a markedly decrease or disappearance after treatment. The locations of these lesions were as follows: the juxtacortical and deep white matter in 7 lesions, periventricular white matter in 2 lesions, basal ganglia in 1 lesion, and infratentorial aera in 1 lesion. Baseline MRI characteristics in patients with non-enhancing T2-FLAIR hyperintensity lesions exhibited a higher rate of multiple enhancing lesions (P = 0.027), and bilateral enhancing lesions (P = 0.001), compared to patients without non-enhancing T2-FLAIR hyperintensity lesions.Conclusion: Non-enhancing T2-FLAIR hyperintensity lesions at a distance from the enhancing tumor lesions in patients with PCNSL, which indicated of neoplastic nature, was not rare. Those non-enhancing lesions should be incorporated in the initial evaluation of tumor burden and response in the follow up.",

In previous reports of sinus pericranii, T2 hyperintensity lesion has not been regarded as a common sequela. We report an extremely rare case of orbital sinus pericranii with associated T2 hyperintensity lesion. A 50-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with a history of right upper eyelid swelling that had been present for several years. Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and digital subtraction angiography demonstrated a connection between the lesion and normal cerebral venous system. Thus, we diagnosed the lesion as a sinus pericranii despite its atypical features. We elected to observe the patient, and the lesion had remained the same size without any adverse events, such as hemorrhage, occurring throughout the 5-year follow-up. An atypical sinus pericranii should be considered in patients with a soft compressible swelling on the head, even if the lesion is located off the midline.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Retroperitoneal ganglioneuroma (RGN) is a rare, benign tumor derived from neural crest cells of the sympathetic nervous system. Due to its rarity and complex management, clinical understanding remains limited. This study aimed to analyze the clinical features and surgical outcomes of RGN.<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective analysis was performed utilizing the retroperitoneal tumor database of Peking University International Hospital. Patients who underwent surgical resection for pathologically confirmed primary RGN between January 2015 and August 2024 were included. Systematic postoperative follow-up was conducted to assess outcomes.<h4>Results</h4>Fifty-one consecutive patients (18 males, 33 females; median age 28 years, range 12-73) with newly diagnosed RGN were enrolled. Clinical presentations were heterogeneous: 29 cases (56.9%) were incidental findings on physical examination, 16 (31.4%) reported abdominal discomfort, 3 (5.9%) had lumbago, and single cases presented with hematuria, chest tightness, or lower limb pain. R0/R1 resection was achieved in 45 patients (88.2%). Postoperative complications occurred in 11 patients (21.6%), including gastroparesis (<i>n</i> = 3), pancreatic fistula (<i>n</i> = 3), liver function impairment (<i>n</i> = 2), wound infection (<i>n</i> = 2), and one mortality due to intestinal ischemia and necrosis. Histopathology confirmed GN in all cases. At median follow-up of 62 months (90.2% follow-up rate), no recurrences, metastases, or disease-specific deaths occurred-including in R2 resection patients (<i>n</i> = 6).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Retroperitoneal ganglioneuroma (RGN) is a rare benign tumor that frequently presents with nonspecific symptoms. While surgical resection remains the cornerstone of management, it is best undertaken at specialized, high-volume sarcoma centers to mitigate operative risks. When complete excision is precluded by critical vascular involvement, subtotal resection represents a judicious alternative. For selected patients with small, asymptomatic tumors-particularly those with elevated surgical risk-active surveillance is a reasonable option. Despite a generally favorable prognosis, long-term follow-up is recommended.",

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the thoracic spine revealed a round-shape expansive lesion at T11 with spinal cord edema and homogeneous contrast enhancement. Despite a chronic presentation, the subacute progression of bladder dysfunction and spinal cord edema warranted timely intervention. Intraoperatively, a vascular malformation resembling a dural arteriovenous fistula (SDAVF), unrecognized at pre-operative imaging, was found in association, and histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of hemangioma. The mechanism of coexistence remains unclear, although venous hypertension due to fistula could induce vascular malformations. <b>Conclusions</b>: This case emphasizes the importance of thorough imaging, timely intervention and intraoperative assessment in patients presenting with a suspicion of spinal hemangioma; it may also provide awareness of potentially associated concurrent lesions such as SDAVFs, unrecognized at pre-operative imaging, and technical insights during surgery.",

There are no strong epidemiological data, and the diagnostic pathway is complex and sometimes incomplete. Furthermore, many cases may be misdiagnosed as other forms of acute and subacute myelopathies. The focus of this review is the clinical and neuroradiological issues in diagnosing SCI and their respective reliability in a clinical setting. The new proposed diagnostic criteria of SCI, although not covering all aspects, highlight the need for a comprehensive approach, including even atypical cases, as the lack of cord compression on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the only mandatory feature for diagnosis. Some MRI features are supportive of the diagnosis, particularly when the anterior spinal artery territory is involved and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is used. Several etiologies can be considered, considering traditional vascular risk factors and diseases affecting the aorta and its main branches, yet a significant proportion of cases remain without a definite etiology. The strongest predictor of SCI diagnosis is a clinical variable, i.e., a time to nadir of severe deficits < 12 h.",

      "abstract": "Paediatric magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) has been increasingly employed in the evaluation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the past decade. This is in parallel with a global rise in paediatric-onset IBD, greater recognition of the hazards of ionizing radiation, especially in children, and improved treatment options. MRE is now the reference standard for assessing the small bowel in suspected or proven paediatric IBD, and is central to the diagnosis of Crohn's disease (CD), helping distinguish it from ulcerative colitis. This review will discuss the standard and advanced techniques applied in paediatric MRE to define the presence, extent and severity of intestinal IBD, and increasingly colonic and perianal disease. Its role in demonstrating enteric and extra-enteric disease and characterizing this as active inflammation and/or damage will be explored, including the utility of cinematic, diffusion weighted and magnetization transfer imaging. While MRE is increasingly used to guide medical versus surgical management, considerable overlap exists between conventional MRE imaging features for inflammation and damage, as reflected pathologically, which is driving ongoing research. Paediatric MRE-based scoring systems for CD are currently under development that will further consolidate the role of MRE in paediatric IBD, reinforced by implementation of standardized analysis, interpretation and reporting. As an imaging biomarker, MRE performs well when referenced against endoscopy and clinical biomarkers for evidence of mucosal healing, the current treatment goal. MRE is anticipated to have even greater impact as an imaging biomarker through demonstration of transmural disease and healing, not amenable to endoscopic assessment.",

      "abstract": "The use of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) for evaluating active bowel disease in Crohn’s disease (CD) is promising and has been advocated as an alternative to intravenous gadolinium-based contrast agents. However, DWI at abdominal level remains a challenge, especially because of motion artifacts (not only patient motion artifacts but also breathing artifacts and peristaltis). Hence, the standard single-shot echo-planar imaging (EPI) DWI currently used suffers from geometric distortion and low spatial resolution. The first technique developed to improve DWI was the use of parallel imaging like sensitivity encoding (SENSE). This technique, using multiple coils, allows a faster imaging, each coil acquiring only a part of the k-space. To correct aliasing artifact due to this partial acquisition of k-space, a calibration is also acquired by each coil. Finally, the image is reconstructed by an algorithm using data from each coil. This technique is particularly interesting for brain imaging, which is mainly subjected to low linear motion artifacts. In comparison, abdominal imaging is characterized by a number of nonlinear motion artifacts (breathing and bowel motion especially). Moreover, parallel imaging induces signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) decrease of the square root of the acceleration factor used. Multi-shot EPI-based DWI with multiplexed sensitivity encoding (MUSE-DWI) is based on this technology but with some improvements using only a pure post-processing reconstruction algorithm without need of new sequence. The technique proposed for multi-shot DWI is an image reconstruction algorithm, which employs matrix inversion using larger than the original matrix by a factor of the number of shots. As a result, MUSE reconstruction is far less susceptible to undesirable noise amplification and hence enhanced image quality because of the improved matrix inversion conditioning of the MUSE framework. During acquisition, a full field of view (FOV) image, with low spatial resolution allowing estimation of the B0 field, is acquired at each shot by oversampling the center of k-space map and then reducing distortion artifacts. Moreover, phase inconsistencies between each shot, considered as “noise,” are then detected and can be removed. However, this “noise” corresponds in part to motion artifacts, including linear and nonlinear ones; its removal then improves spatial resolution. Furthermore, noise reduction, in association with a shorter echo train length, contributes to the rise in SNR and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). Finally, better spatial resolution is observed for two reasons. First, a full FOV image is performed at each shot allowing better registration of each point with lower motion artifacts. Second, using multiple shots, echo train length is reduced and blurring artifact due to signal decrease in T2 is limited. For example, in this issue of JMRI, the authors used 128 lines for ssDWI with SENSE factor 2, and 64 echoes are collected at each shot. For MUSE, 192 lines are acquired with four shots, 48 echoes are therefore collected at each shot, 25% less than with ssDWI. In this issue of JMRI, Chang et al used MUSE-DWI to improve spatial resolution and SNR for active bowel inflammation assessment in CD. The first step of the study was concerned with image quality. The authors demonstrated a better tissue texture conspicuity, lower geometry distortion, and a lower extents of artifacts in comparison with single-shot EPI-based DWI (ssDWI). Finally, it allowed a better overall image quality but without diagnostic confidence improvement. The second step of the study was concerned with diagnostic performances. Using contrast-enhanced MR imaging as reference standard, MUSE-DWI showed a better accuracy for active CD diagnosis with better sensitivity and better specificity than ssDWI. However, it should be noted that this",

      "abstract": "Abstract Purpose We compared contrast-enhanced MR enterography with diffusion-weighted sequences to evaluate the validity of diffusion-weighted sequences for activity assessment in Crohnʼs disease compared to endoscopy. In addition, we investigated a new color-coded image post-processing technique in comparison with standard sequences and endoscopy. Materials and Methods Included were 197 MR enterographies (2015–2017) performed by using standardized examination protocols. The intestine was divided into 7 segments, which were compared separately. The accuracy of the MR examinations with regard to disease activity was validated using the Seo and MaRIA score and endoscopy findings. In addition, the image data were post-processed using a color-coded evaluation method (DCE tool on OsiriX). Results The comparison between contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted sequences showed a highly significant correlation for all bowel sections with a mean Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.876 (0.809–0.928). The color-coded image post-processing showed a sensitivity of 83.2 % and a specificity of 70.5 % in comparison with the MaRIA score. In comparison to endoscopy, a sensitivity of 81.3 % and a specificity of 70.5 %. In comparison with endoscopy, the MaRIA score showed a sensitivity of 80.2 % and a specificity of 84.0 % at a cut-off of 7. The visual score according to Seo showed a sensitivity of 85.7 % with a specificity of 77.0 % in the contrast-weighted examination and a sensitivity of 87.9 % and a specificity of 71.8 % for diffusion weighted images. Conclusion Diffusion-weighted sequences are as good as contrast-weighted sequences for assessing inflammatory activity in Crohnʼs disease. Contrast is often helpful for assessing complications, but this was not the purpose of this study. Visual imaging using color-coded data sets was similarly good at detecting inflammation. Key points: MR enterography is possible without contrast using diffusion-weighted imaging with comparable high informative value. Inflammatory activity in MR correlates sufficiently well with endoscopy The MaRIA and Seo scores are comparable in their validity. The colored representation of inflamed bowel sections is a promising technique. Citation Format Jakob M, Backes M, Schaefer C et al.

Fortschr Röntgenstr 2022; 194: 1119 – 1131 Zusammenfassung Ziel Vergleich der entzündlichen Aktivität verschiedener Darmabschnitte in der kontrastmittelgestützten MR-Enterografie mit diffusionsgewichteten Sequenzen und dem endoskopischen Befund. Eine neue farbcodierte Bildnachverarbeitung wurde im Vergleich zu den Standardsequenzen und der Endoskopie untersucht. Material und Methoden Eingeschlossen wurden 197 MR-Enterografien aus den Jahren 2015–2017. Der Darm wurde in 7 Segmente unterteilt, die separat verglichen wurden. Die Treffsicherheit der MR-Untersuchungen bezüglich entzündlicher Darmwandveränderungen wurde mittels Endoskopie sowie Seo- und MaRIA-Scores validiert. Zusätzlich wurden die Bilddaten mithilfe eines farbcodierten Auswerteverfahrens (DCE-Tool auf OsiriX) nachverarbeitet. Ergebnisse Der Vergleich zwischen kontrastgestützten und diffusionsgewichteten Sequenzen ergab für alle Darmabschnitte eine hochsignifikante Korrelation mit einem mittleren Korrelationskoeffizienten nach Spearman von 0,876 (0,809–0,928). Die farbcodierte Bildnachverarbeitung zeigte im Vergleich mit dem MaRIA-Score eine Sensitivität von 83,2 % und eine Spezifität von 70,5 %. Im Vergleich zur Endoskopie fand sich eine Sensitivität von 81,3 % und eine Spezifität von 70,5 %. Der MaRIA-Score zeigte im Vergleich mit der Endoskopie beim Cut-Off von 7 eine Sensitivität von 80,2 % bei einer Spezifität von 84,0 %. Der visuelle Score nach Seo zeigte bei der kontrastgestützten Untersuchung eine Sensitivität 85,7 % bei einer Spezifität von 77,0 %, bei der diffusionsgewichteten Sequenz eine Sensitivität von 87,9 % und einer Spezifität von 71,8 %. Schlussfolgerung Diffusionsgewichtete Sequenzen sind zur Beurteilung der Entzündungsaktivität bei Morbus Crohn ebenso gut geeignet wie kontrastgestützte Sequenzen. Zur Beurteilung von Komplikationen ist eine Kontrastmittelgabe oft hilfreich. Die Darstellung mittels farbcodierter Datensätze konnte Entzündungen ähnlich gut nachweisen und könnte die Befunddemonstration in der interdisziplinären Zusammenarbeit verbessern helfen. Kernaussagen: Die MR-Enterografie ist auch ohne Kontrastmittel mittels diffusionsgewichteter Bildgebung mit vergleichbar hoher Aussagekraft möglich. Die Entzündungsaktivität in der MRT korreliert ausreichend gut mit dem endoskopischen Befund. Die verwendeten Scores MaRIA und Seo sind in ihrer Aussage vergleichbar. Die farbige Darstellung entzündeter Darmabschnitte kann eine rasche Einschätzung der regionären Verteilung einer Crohn-Manifestation ‚auf einen Blick‘ erleichtern und könnte die Befunddemonstration in der interdisziplinären Zusammenarbeit verbessern.

      "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nPerianal fistulas are a common inflammatory condition of the anal canal and perianal tissue. The introduction of MRI in the evaluation of suspected perianal inflammation has greatly improved the surgical outcome of these patients as it allowed the direct visualization of anal sphincters, levator ani muscle, and the extent of the disease in relation to these vital structures. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has been under extensive research to evaluate whether it adds any value in the setting of perianal inflammation.\nThe aim of our study was to evaluate the visibility of perianal inflammation on DWI and evaluate the diffusion characteristics of perianal fistulas and abscesses and how accurately can DWI classify perianal disease.\n\nResults\nMean age of patients was 37 ± 8.9 years old. The study included 30 fistulas and 15 abscesses. Seven patients had more than 1 fistula or fistula and abscess. Perianal abscesses were well visualized equally on DWI and T2W images and correctly classified by DWI, when compared to post-contrast images. Perianal fistulas without abscesses, on the other hand, had variable visibility scores. Although the visibility of these fistulas on DWI was generally less than T2W and combined DWI and T2W, yet this did not reach a significant level and it was not significantly different between positive and negative inflammatory groups. Combined DWI and T2W evaluation had the highest performance and accurately classified 97.8 % of perianal fistulas and abscesses, and only 1 case was misclassified (2.3%).\n\nConclusion\nDWI had a good performance in the evaluation of perianal inflammatory disease. However, combined DWI and T2W evaluation had better performance which was not significantly different from combined T2W and post-contrast images.\n",

      "abstract": "Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is a type of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technique sensitised to the diffusivity of water molecules, offering the capability to inspect tissue microstructures and is the only in-vivo method to reconstruct white matter fiber tracts non-invasively. The DWI signal can be analysed with the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) model to estimate the directionality of water diffusion within voxels. Several scalar metrics, including axial diffusivity (AD), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), and fractional anisotropy (FA), can be further derived from DTI to quantitatively summarise the microstructural integrity of brain tissue. These scalar metrics have played an important role in understanding the organisation and health of brain tissue at a microscopic level in clinical studies. However, reliable DTI metrics rely on DWI acquisitions with high gradient directions, which often go beyond the commonly used clinical protocols. To enhance the utility of clinically acquired DWI and save scanning time for robust DTI analysis, this work proposes DirGeo-DTI, a deep learning-based method to estimate reliable DTI metrics even from a set of DWIs acquired with the minimum theoretical number (6) of gradient directions. DirGeo-DTI leverages directional encoding and geometric constraints to facilitate the training process. Two public DWI datasets were used for evaluation, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method achieves the best performance compared to existing DTI enhancement methods and potentially reveals further clinical insights with routine clinical DWI scans.",

      "abstract": "Diffusion Tensor Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (DT-CMR) is the only in vivo method to non-invasively examine the microstructure of the human heart. Current research in DT-CMR aims to improve the understanding of how the cardiac microstructure relates to the macroscopic function of the healthy heart as well as how microstructural dysfunction contributes to disease. To get the final DT-CMR metrics, we need to acquire diffusion weighted images of at least 6 directions. However, due to DWI's low signal-to-noise ratio, the standard voxel size is quite big on the scale for microstructures. In this study, we explored the potential of deep-learning-based methods in improving the image quality volumetrically (x4 in all dimensions). This study proposed a novel framework to enable volumetric super-resolution, with an additional model input of high-resolution b0 DWI. We demonstrated that the additional input could offer higher super-resolved image quality. Going beyond, the model is also able to super-resolve DWIs of unseen b-values, proving the model framework's generalizability for cardiac DWI superresolution. In conclusion, we would then recommend giving the model a high-resolution reference image as an additional input to the low-resolution image for training and inference to guide all super-resolution frameworks for parametric imaging where a reference image is available.",

Although cerebrovascular complications are commonly reported, cerebral vasculitis remains an exceedingly rare occurrence and only a limited number of cases have been described. We present the case of a 35-year-old man with CD who presented with acute onset of right-sided hemiparesis, hemiataxia and paresthesias. Laboratory data showed an inflammatory profile. Contrast-enhanced brain magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) with vessel wall imaging well demonstrated focal areas of contrast enhancement in the perforating arteries and distal arterial branches of intracranial vessels, raising the suspicion of a vasculitic process. The patient was then started on high-dose steroid therapy with immediate improvement of the neurological condition. Follow-up brain MRA revealed a significant reduction of the focal contrast-enhancing alterations. If not accurately identified and promptly treated, vasculitic processes may lead to significant disabilities in young patients and should be considered in the differential etiologies of juvenile stroke since symptoms can improve with immunosuppressive treatment.

We aimed to assess the prevalence of SI detected by MRE in a cohort of CD patients, and the associations of SI with demographic and clinical features and with intestinal MRE findings. Two hundred patients affected by CD (M:F 1:1, median age 49.5 (22.5) years, median CD duration 4.75 (16.2) years) tested with MRE between 2011 and 2023 were selected.

Thirty-five percent of patients underwent ileocecal resection. One out of ten patients were treated with at least one TNFαi.

Subgroup analysis revealed higher endoscopic response, mucosal healing, and TH rates in both colorectal and ileal segments at weeks 16 and 52 in the BioEEN group. Additionally, the BioEEN group had significantly lower rates of surgery, escalated treatment, bowel damage progression, and disease relapse at 1 and 2 years.

The study included 72 CD patients who underwent both DECTE and DBE, with 4 patients repeating both procedures within 3 months.<h4>Results</h4>The diagnostic rate of small bowel CD using DBE was 80.3%, which was higher than that using DECTE (65.8%, P = 0.044). The combined small bowel CD diagnostic rate was 89.5%, which was higher than that of DECTE alone (P < 0.001). The detection rate of stenosis using DBE was 46.1%, which was higher than that using DECTE (13.2%; P < 0.001). The combined detection rate of stenosis was 52.6%, which was higher than that of DECTE alone (P < 0.001). For ulcers, DBE had a higher detection rate (73.7%) than DECTE (7.9%; P < 0.001). The combined ulcer detection rate was 76.3%, which was higher than that of DECTE alone (P < 0.001). The detection rate of long ulcers (≥ 2 cm) and non-ileocecal ulcers by DBE were both 17.9%. For patients with abdominal pain, DBE had a diagnostic rate of 79.4%, higher than 63.5% of DECTE (χ2 = 3.889, P = 0.049). The combined diagnostic rate was 87.3%, which was higher than that of DECTE alone (χ2 = 9.626, P = 0.002). For patients with diarrhoea, the DBE's diagnostic rates were 86.8% and 68.4% for DECTE (P = 0.097). The combined diagnostic rate was 94.7%, higher than DECTE alone (χ2 = 7.092, P = 0.008). For patients with other symptoms, such as abdominal distension or vomiting, the DBE diagnostic rate was 79.4% compared with 61.8% for DECTE (P = 0.183).

Furthermore, notable differences in C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, faecal calprotectin, haemoglobin, platelet count, albumin, haematocrit, Crohn's Disease Activity Index scores, and Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease scores were observed between ulcer-positive and ulcer-negative patients detected by DBE (P < 0.05), whereas DECTE did not show significant differences (P > 0.05).<h4>Conclusions</h4>DBE or the combined use of DECTE and DBE provides superior diagnostic performance for small bowel CD, particularly in detecting stenosis and ulcers, compared with DECTE alone. DBE can be used to identify long ulcers and non-ileocecal ulcers. Moreover, DBE helps diagnose small bowel CD across different clinical manifestations and assess disease activity in various inflammatory states.",

      "abstract": "It is challenging to identify residual or recurrent fistulas from the surgical region, while MR imaging is feasible. The aim was to use dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging (DCE-MRI) technology to distinguish between active anal fistula and postoperative healing (granulation) tissue. Thirty-six patients following idiopathic anal fistula underwent DCE-MRI. Subjects were divided into Group I (active fistula) and Group IV (postoperative healing tissue), with the latter divided into Group II (≤ 75 days) and Group III (> 75 days) according to the 75-day interval from surgery to postoperative MRI reexamination. MRI classification and quantitative analysis were performed. Correlation between postoperative time intervals and parameters was analyzed. The difference of parameters between the four groups was analyzed, and diagnostic efficiency was tested by receiver operating characteristic curve. Wash-in rate (WI) and peak enhancement intensity (PEI) were significantly higher in Group I than in Group II (p = 0.003, p = 0.040), while wash-out rate (WO), time to peak (TTP), and normalized signal intensity (NSI) were opposite (p = 0.031, p = 0.007, p = 0.010). Area under curves for discriminating active fistula from healing tissue within 75 days were 0.810 in WI, 0.708 in PEI, 0.719 in WO, 0.783 in TTP, 0.779 in NSI. All MRI parameters were significantly different between Group I and Group IV, but not between Group II and Group III, and not related to time intervals. In early postoperative period, DCE-MRI can be used to identify active anal fistula in the surgical area. Chinese Clinical Trial Registry: ChiCTR2000033072.",

We screened patients who underwent RFCA for AF and EGD based on esophageal late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in postablation magnetic resonance imaging. Patients with ETI diagnosed with EGD were included. We defined severity of ETI according to Kansas City classification: type 1: erythema; type 2: ulcers (2a: superficial; 2b deep); type 3 perforation (3a: perforation; 3b: perforation with atrioesophageal fistula [AEF]). Repeated EGD was performed within 1-14 days after the last EGD if recommended and possible until any certain healing signs (visible reduction in size without deepening of ETI or complete resolution) were observed. ETI was observed in 62 of 378 patients who underwent EGD after RFCA. Out of these 62 patients with ETI, 21% (13) were type 1, 50% (31) were type 2a and 29% (18) were type 2b at the initial EGD. All esophageal lesions, but one type 2b lesion that developed into an AEF, showed signs of healing in repeated EGD studies within 14 days after the procedure. The one type 2b lesion developing into an AEF showed an increase in size and ulcer deepening in repeat EGD 8 days after the procedure. We found that all ETI which did not progress to AEF presented healing signs within 14 days after the procedure and that worsening ETI might be an early signal for developing esophageal perforation.",

Therefore, we reviewed the evidence for strategies to enhance the efficacy of TNF antagonists for PCD. A systematic search of electronic databases through July 2018 was performed to identify studies that assessed the effectiveness of TNF antagonists combined with another medical or surgical intervention for PCD; or assessed the association between anti-TNF serum concentrations and fistula healing. Twelve studies compared anti-TNF therapy alone versus a combined approach: four with surgery, three with antibiotics, and five with immunomodulators. Only two studies, both with antibiotics, were rated high quality. The addition of antibiotics to anti-TNF therapy resulted in significantly higher rates of fistula response and healing in one study, and a trend toward reduction in fistula drainage in the other. Three of four studies found higher rates of fistula healing when surgery was combined with TNF antagonists. In contrast, one of five studies found a trend toward higher rates of fistula healing in patients treated concomitantly with immunomodulators. Five observational studies assessed the association between anti-TNF concentration and fistula healing. Higher infliximab serum concentrations were consistently associated with fistula healing. In conclusion, few high-quality studies assessing strategies to optimize anti-TNF therapy for PCD exist. Although antibiotics, possibly surgery, and higher serum infliximab concentrations appear to improve fistula healing, future prospective studies are needed to determine the optimal treatment strategy.",

      "abstract": "Self-expanding plastic stents (SEPS) have emerged as a good alternative to surgery in esophageal leaks and fistulae. There is scarce published literature regarding its efficacy in these conditions. We present our experience with SEPS in treatment of esophageal leaks and fistulae. Consecutive patients admitted in a tertiary referral center who underwent SEPS placement for esophageal leak or fistula between February 2012 and February 2015 were retrospectively evaluated. Patients underwent prior assessment with upper gastrointestinal endoscopic and thoracic contrast-enhanced computed tomography assessment. SEPS (25-mm flares, 21-mm diameter) were placed under fluoroscopic guidance. A silk thread tied to upper end was routed through nostril and fixed to prevent stent migration. Nasojejunal tube was inserted in all patients. Intercostal drain was inserted in the case of hydro/pyopneumothorax. Twelve patients [eight male, median age 45.3 years (19 to 65 years)] were included. Etiologies were spontaneous leaks due to Boerhaave syndrome (n = 2), corrosive fistulae (n = 2), tubercular fistulae (n = 4), invasive Candida esophagitis-induced fistula (n = 1), iatrogenic leaks (n = 2; one achalasia dilatation, one obesity surgery), and pancreaticoesophageal fistula due to ruptured pancreatic pseudocyst (n = 1). Stent placement was successful in all patients with no immediate postprocedure complications. Successful healing was seen in nine patients (75 %). Stents were removed after a median time of 83.5 days (13-190 days). Stent migration was seen in four patients (33.3 %), and in two of them, it was retrieved and redeployed; none had early migration (<72 h). Reasons for SEPS failure in our cohort were failure of effective sepsis control in two patients and poor wound healing seen in one patient having multiple tubercular fistulae. SEPS is a safe, well-tolerated treatment with good success rate (75 %) in treatment of esophageal leaks and fistulae.",

      "abstract": "\\textit{Objective:} Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) have been widely used to better visualize disease in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, gadolinium deposition within the brain and body has raised safety concerns about the use of GBCAs. Therefore, the development of novel approaches that can decrease or even eliminate GBCA exposure while providing similar contrast information would be of significant use clinically. \\textit{Methods:} In this work, we present a deep learning based approach for contrast-enhanced T1 synthesis on brain tumor patients. A 3D high-resolution fully convolutional network (FCN), which maintains high resolution information through processing and aggregates multi-scale information in parallel, is designed to map pre-contrast MRI sequences to contrast-enhanced MRI sequences. Specifically, three pre-contrast MRI sequences, T1, T2 and apparent diffusion coefficient map (ADC), are utilized as inputs and the post-contrast T1 sequences are utilized as target output. To alleviate the data imbalance problem between normal tissues and the tumor regions, we introduce a local loss to improve the contribution of the tumor regions, which leads to better enhancement results on tumors. \\textit{Results:} Extensive quantitative and visual assessments are performed, with our proposed model achieving a PSNR of 28.24dB in the brain and 21.2dB in tumor regions. \\textit{Conclusion and Significance:} Our results suggest the potential of substituting GBCAs with synthetic contrast images generated via deep learning.

In recent years, many learning-based methods for image enhancement have been developed, where the Look-up-table (LUT) has proven to be an effective tool. In this paper, we delve into the potential of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) Guided Prompt Learning, proposing a simple structure called CLIP-LUT for image enhancement. We found that the prior knowledge of CLIP can effectively discern the quality of degraded images, which can provide reliable guidance. To be specific, We initially learn image-perceptive prompts to distinguish between original and target images using CLIP model, in the meanwhile, we introduce a very simple network by incorporating a simple baseline to predict the weights of three different LUT as enhancement network. The obtained prompts are used to steer the enhancement network like a loss function and improve the performance of model. We demonstrate that by simply combining a straightforward method with CLIP, we can obtain satisfactory results.",

An expert radiologist reviewed MRE for intestinal wall thickening, stricture, abscess formation, fibrofatty proliferation, and fat edema. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to analyze associations between mesenteric fat and outcomes, adjusting for clinical and imaging characteristics.<h4>Results</h4>Among 175 CD patients mesenteric fat proliferation and edema were noted in 52 (29.7%) and 15 (8.9%) patients, respectively. Other findings included wall thickening (46.9% mild, 29.1% moderate, 7.4% severe), stricture (14.3%), abscess (5.7%), and fistula (6.9%). During a mean follow-up of 95.2 months, 93 (51.3%) patients were hospitalized for CD-related reasons, and 47 (26.9%) underwent CD-related abdominal surgery.

The participants were divided into two age cohorts: infants (0-12 months) and toddlers (13-36 months). Data were meticulously collected for both cohorts, with anal function assessed through intraoperative anorectal manometry, Masson staining of fistula tissue, and the Heikkinen clinical continence scoring (CCS) scale during the postoperative period RESULTS: (1) Both cohorts demonstrated a 100% postoperative healing rate. The average healing duration was 15.58 ± 3.21 days for the infant cohort and 16.57 ± 3.65 days for the toddler cohort. Anorectal manometry indicated the presence of the anorectal inhibitory reflex (RAIR) in both cohorts. Postfistulotomy, there was a slight decrease in anal rectal pressure (ARP), although this reduction was not statistically significant (p > 0.05) and was unrelated to the complexity of the fistula. Pathological examination of the fistula tissues revealed low muscle content in both cohorts, accounting for 14.1 ± 1.35% in the infant cohort and 17.2 ± 2.86% in the toddler cohort. The muscle composition varied between the cohorts; the infant cohort predominantly had smooth muscle with minimal striated muscle, whereas the toddler cohort had both smooth and striated muscle, with a relatively higher proportion of striated muscle. The CCS scores showed significant improvement at 6 months postoperation and during long-term follow-up compared to preoperative scores, with long-term follow-up results being superior to those at six months (p < 0.01).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Surgical treatment for pediatric anal fistulas demonstrates is both effective and safe, with a potential for long-term improvement in anorectal function over time.",

Two abdominal radiologists reviewed the MRE for the presence of active inflammation, intramural edema, restricted diffusion, stricture, probable stricture, ulceration, sacculation, simple fistula, complex fistula, sinus tract, inflammatory mass, abscess, perienteric inflammation, engorged vasa recta, fibrofatty proliferation, and perianal disease. Bowel wall thickness, length of bowel involvement, and degree of upstream dilation in strictures were quantified. Subsequent bowel resection, prior bowel surgery, and available laboratory values were recorded. The association between progression to surgery and imaging features was evaluated using a logistic regression model adjusting for demographics, prior bowel surgery, medication usage, and body mass index. 19.2% (10/52) of patients progressed to surgery. Restricted diffusion, greater degree of upstream dilation from stricture, complex fistula, perienteric inflammation, and fibrofatty proliferation were significantly more common in patients progressing to surgery (all p < 0.05). κ for these significant findings ranged 0.568-0.885. Patients progressing to surgery had longer length bowel involvement (p = 0.03). Platelet count, ESR, and fecal calprotectin were significantly higher, and serum albumin was significantly lower in patients progressing to surgery. Prior bowel surgery, sex, age, and all other parameters were similar. Radiologists should carefully describe bowel dilation upstream from strictures, penetrating and perienteric findings on outpatient MRE in CD patients, as these findings may herald progression to surgery.",

Refractory adult patients with CD who had draining perianal fistulas were enrolled in this study. All patients were examined by a colorectal surgeon and the fistula imaging studies were performed by pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). After autologous bone marrow (BM) aspiration and MSCs isolation, the cells were cultured and passaged under current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) conditions. Four intra-fistula injections of cells, each containing 40×10<sup>6</sup> MSCs suspended in fibrin glue, were administered by an expert surgeon every 4 weeks. Procedure safety, feasibility and closure of the perianal fistulas at week 24 were assessed. Clinical examination and MRI findings were considered as the primary end points. In total, 5 patients (2 males and 3 females) were enrolled in this study. No adverse events were observed during the six-month follow-up in these patients. Both the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and Perianal Disease Activity Index (PDAI) scores decreased in all patients after cell injections and one patient achieved complete remission with closure of fistulas, discontinuation of fistula discharge, and closure of the external opening. Local injection of MSCs combined with fibrin glue is potentially a safe and effective therapeutic approach for complex perianal fistulas in patients with CD.",

      "abstract": "Perianal disease occurs in up to 90% of patients with Crohn's disease [1-4]. Many of these patients have only mild symptoms or are asymptomatic and thus require no intervention. Clinical features are variable and include hypertrophic skin tags, ulceration, perianal abscess and fistulae, anal canal ulcers, fissures, induration and stenosis. Perianal abscess and fistula often occur simultaneously and are usually symptomatic. Symptoms range from pain, discharge, bleeding, to gross faecal incontinence with restriction of lifestyle and sexual activity. There is little uniformity amongst clinicians in the investigation and management of perianal Crohn's disease [5]. This is due, in part, to the variability in both frequency and severity of attacks and to spontaneous remissions and exacerbations of perianal disease. Secondly, assessment of severity of illness and the response to treatment is difficult to objectively quantitative. Improvement in quality of life is the aim of therapy not cure of perianal disease. Investigative modalities for perianal Crohn's are changing due to the limitations of conventional fistulography, CT scanning and clinical evaluation. MRI scanning has been introduced more recently, however, requires an endorectal coil to obtain good anatomical visualisation and has limited availability [6-12]. Endorectal ultrasonography has been shown to detect more abscesses and fistula in Crohn's patients than clinical examination, proctosigmoidoscopy and CT scanning, better delineation of fistulous tracts than fistulography and has the ability to change the clinical management of referring physicians [13-16]. Most fistulae are not explored surgically and therefore the documentation of fistulae in symptomatic Crohn's disease has been limited and are usually classified only as high or low [4]. Park's has pointed out this terminology for cryptoglandular disease is \"... an ambiguous one\" and hence developed a more precise nomenclature [17]. The objective of this study was to document prospectively by transanorectal ultrasonography fistulae and abscesses in symptomatic perianal Crohn's disease and to classify them according to Park's nomenclature and determine the incidence of these at the time of referral for a new exacerbation of the disease. Anal wall thickness was measured prospectively by ultrasonography as it has been shown to be increased in patients with perianal Crohn's disease and may reflect disease activity [13, 18].",

      "abstract": "Progressive cognitive decline spanning across decades is characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Various predictive models have been designed to realize its early onset and study the long-term trajectories of cognitive test scores across populations of interest. Research efforts have been geared towards superimposing patients' cognitive test scores with the long-term trajectory denoting gradual cognitive decline, while considering the heterogeneity of AD. Multiple trajectories representing cognitive assessment for the long-term have been developed based on various parameters, highlighting the importance of classifying several groups based on disease progression patterns. In this study, a novel method capable of self-organized prediction, classification, and the overlay of long-term cognitive trajectories based on short-term individual data was developed, based on statistical and differential equation modeling. We validated the predictive accuracy of the proposed method for the long-term trajectory of cognitive test score results on two cohorts: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study and the Japanese ADNI study. We also presented two practical illustrations of the simultaneous evaluation of risk factor associated with both the onset and the longitudinal progression of AD, and an innovative randomized controlled trial design for AD that standardizes the heterogeneity of patients enrolled in a clinical trial. These resources would improve the power of statistical hypothesis testing and help evaluate the therapeutic effect. The application of predicting the trajectory of longitudinal disease progression goes beyond AD, and is especially relevant for progressive and neurodegenerative disorders.",

      "abstract": "The ability to predict the future trajectory of a patient is a key step toward the development of therapeutics for complex diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, most machine learning approaches developed for prediction of disease progression are either single-task or single-modality models, which can not be directly adopted to our setting involving multi-task learning with high dimensional images. Moreover, most of those approaches are trained on a single dataset (i.e. cohort), which can not be generalized to other cohorts. We propose a novel multimodal multi-task deep learning model to predict AD progression by analyzing longitudinal clinical and neuroimaging data from multiple cohorts. Our proposed model integrates high dimensional MRI features from a 3D convolutional neural network with other data modalities, including clinical and demographic information, to predict the future trajectory of patients. Our model employs an adversarial loss to alleviate the study-specific imaging bias, in particular the inter-study domain shifts. In addition, a Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) optimization technique is applied to further improve model generalization. The proposed model is trained and tested on various datasets in order to evaluate and validate the results. Our results showed that 1) our model yields significant improvement over the baseline models, and 2) models using extracted neuroimaging features from 3D convolutional neural network outperform the same models when applied to MRI-derived volumetric features.",

While new computational methods offer insights into AD progression, the reproducibility of these subtypes across datasets remains understudied, particularly concerning the robustness of subtype definitions when validated on diverse databases. This study evaluates the consistency of AD progression subtypes identified by the Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) algorithm using T1-weighted MRI data across 5,444 subjects from ANMerge, OASIS, and ADNI datasets, forming four independent cohorts. Each cohort was analyzed under two conditions: one using the full cohort, including cognitively normal controls, and another excluding controls to test subtype robustness. Results confirm the three primary atrophy subtypes identified in earlier studies: Typical, Cortical, and Subcortical, as well as the emergence of rare and atypical AD variants such as posterior cortical atrophy (PCA). Notably, each subtype displayed varying robustness to the inclusion of controls, with certain subtypes, like Subcortical, more influenced by cohort composition. This investigation underscores SuStaIn's reliability for defining stable AD subtypes and suggests its utility in clinical stratification for trials and diagnosis. However, our findings also highlight the need for improved dataset diversity, particularly in terms of ethnic representation, to enhance generalizability and support broader clinical application.",

This study compared the incidence of fistula in ano in patients experiencing their first episode of acute perianal sepsis, with and without antibiotic therapy, and evaluated the prevalence of fistula in ano necessitating surgical intervention at 1 year.<h4>Methods</h4>This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital with a dedicated proctology department. All patients who presented to the emergency proctology unit with a first episode of acute perianal sepsis were eligible for inclusion.<h4>Results</h4>This study included 276 patients. At 1 year, fistula formation was identified in 65.6% of all patients, 54.0% of those who had received antibiotics, and 75.0% of those who had not (P<0.001). This finding remained significant after weighted propensity analysis (odds ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.92; P=0.025).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The rate of fistula formation was relatively high in this study. However, it was lower among patients with perianal sepsis who were treated with antibiotics, although a causal relationship could not be established. Prolonged follow-up is needed to clarify the role of antibiotic therapy in preventing or delaying fistula development in patients with acute perianal sepsis.",

Our study evaluated whether FC from the ileostomy output can be used to predict postoperative small bowel inflammation in patients with CD.<h4>Methods</h4>Data from patients with CD and an ileostomy who had undergone FC measurement between January 1, 2015, and December 30, 2022, were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were enrolled in the study if they had undergone FC tests with concurrent imaging and/or endoscopic studies, facilitating comparison between FC tests and imaging and/or endoscopic examinations. FC measured with the point-of care (POC) test was denoted as FC-POCT, and that measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was denoted as FC-ELISA.<h4>Results</h4>This study analyzed 101 patients and 224 FC test results. FC concentration differed significantly in patients with signs of small bowel inflammation on imaging and/or ileoscopy compared with those in remission (FC-POCT: median 191.0 µg/g; interquartile range [IQR], 94.6-499.0 µg/g vs. 29.9 µg/g; IQR, 29.9-50.0 µg/g; P < 0.001; FC-ELISA: median 252.5 µg/g; IQR, 118.5-911.0 µg/g vs. 16.8 µg/g, IQR, 8.2-33.0 µg/g; P < 0.001). The optimal cutoff value for FC-POCT and FC-ELISA to distinguish between small bowel inflammation and remission was 63.3 µg/g (area under the curve [AUC], 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88-0.97) and 40.1 µg/g (AUC, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.79-0.99), respectively. We also compared the diagnostic accuracy between the POC and ELISA testing methods and found no statistically significant difference (P = 0.692).<h4>Conclusions</h4>FC from the ileostomy output is a valuable biomarker with high sensitivity and specificity for monitoring small bowel inflammation in postoperative patients with CD and an ileostomy.",

Visceral fat information from CT images was extracted, including the ratio of visceral to subcutaneous fat volume (VSR), fat distribution, and attenuation values. The valuable indicators were screened out in the derivation cohort by binary logistic regression and receiver working curve (ROC) analysis to construct an imaging report and data system for IBD (IBD-RADS), which was tested in the validation cohort.<h4>Results</h4>The derivation cohort included 606 patients (365 CD, 241 UC), and the validation cohort included 155 patients (97 CD, 58 UC). Asymmetric enhancement (AE) (OR = 87.75 [28.69, 268.4]; P < 0.001), perianal fistula (OR = 4.968 [1.807, 13.66]; P = 0.002) and VSR (OR = 1.571 [1.087, 2.280]; P = 0.04) were independent predictors of CD.

We included patients treated with their first anti-TNF therapy for PFCD after undergoing a pelvic MRI between 2005 and 2022 from 6 North American centres. Our exposure was one or more setons at the time of anti-TNF therapy. Our primary outcome was major adverse fistula outcome (MAFO), a composite of repeat local surgical intervention, hospitalisation, or faecal diversion for PFCD, and our secondary outcome was fistula remission defined clinically. We used 1:1 cardinality matching and propensity score weighting to control for fistula severity based on centrally read MRIs, luminal characteristics, and concomitant therapies. Our analysis included 221 patients: 81 with setons and 140 without setons. After cardinality matching, our cohorts were balanced (standardised difference < 0.1 for all covariates). Patients with setons had similar rates of MAFO (HR 1.23; 95% CI, 0.68-2.21) and fistula remission at 6 months (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.41-1.59) and 12 months (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.31-1.27) compared to patients without setons. Our results remained stable when analysed by propensity score weighting and in a sensitivity analysis of patients who underwent an exam under anaesthesia. In patients with abscesses, there were lower rates of MAFO (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.19-1.25) but not statistically significant in patients with setons. In this multicentre, setons were not associated with improved fistula outcomes. Future prospective controlled studies are warranted.",

This prospective pilot study was conducted at three tertiary referral centers between January 2019 and May 2020. We formulated questions on perianal symptoms, including tenesmus, anal discharge, bleeding, pain, and heat. A 4-point Likert scale was used to rate each question. Patients with CD completed a questionnaire and underwent pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Overall, 93 patients were enrolled, with 51 (54.8%) diagnosed with perianal fistulizing disease, as determined by pelvic MRI. The Spearman correlation findings demonstrated that anal pain (p = 0.450, p < 0.001) and anal discharge (p = 0.556, p < 0.001) were the symptoms that most significantly correlated with perianal disease. For anal pain and discharge, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the scores was significantly higher than that of the combined score for all five symptoms (0.855 vs. 0.794, DeLong's test p = 0.04). For the two symptoms combined, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive and negative predictive values were 88.2, 73.8, 80.4, and 83.8%, respectively, with 81.7% accuracy for detecting perianal fistulizing disease.

The total of 15 patients was recruited at the Juiz de Fora University Hospital between August 2018 and July 2022. Inclusion criteria were presence of clinically suspects RVF of any etiology confirmed by pelvic magnetic resonance image (MRI) and gynecological examination. Five fractional CO2 laser sessions with monthly interval followed by complete evaluation through clinical examination and pelvic MRI were performed for all patients after the completion of treatment. Analysis of sexual function before and after the treatment was performed using Female Sexual Quotient (FSQ). The evaluation through physical examination showed no persistent inflammatory signs in the vagina for all patients. Additionally, 10 of out 15 (67.7%) patients achieved clinical remission of RVF symptoms, while 33.3% patients reported significant improvement. Of note, five patients who did not have previous sexual activity returned to regular sexual activity while seven patients who have baseline sexual activity had improvement in their sexual function as assessed by the FSQ. Three out of four ostomized patients had their ostomy reversed and remained without complains. All six patients with RVF secondary to Crohn's disease reported a marked improvement in symptoms and sexual function. In seven (47%) patients radiological remission was confirmed by pelvic MRI.

      "abstract": "Background: Fistula-in-ano is a granulation tissue lined tract that opens deeply in the anal canal or rectum and superficially on the perianal skin. Most of these fistulae are formed from ano rectal abscess which burst spontaneously. The secondary causes of fistula in ano include conditions such as Crohn’s disease, Tuberculosis and Carcinoma rectum. Fistula in ano can be broadly classified into Anterior and Posterior, Low lying or High Fistula in ano as well as Simple and Complex fistula in ano. Goodsall’s rule depicts the relationship of the external opening of the fistula with the course of fistulous tract. The three main radiological imaging techniques that are used in evaluating perianal fistulas include contrast fistulography, endorectal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging(MRI). Our aim was to assess the accuracy of Goodsall’s rule in predicting the course of anal fistulae and its reliability for evaluating patients presenting with Fistula in ano. We also correlated the clinical and intra-operative findings with that of Magnetic Resonanace(MR) Fistulogram to know whether MR Fistulogram can be used selectively for evaluating Complex Fistula in AnoMethods: This was a Prospective Mono-centric Observational Study conducted at the General Surgery department of Apollo Main Hospital Chennai, from August 2022 to December 2023. The final study sample after considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria was 67. Various parameters such as demographic details, clinical symptoms, characteristics of fistula were studied and comparison was done between the clinical and intra operative findings as well as the imaging findings.Results: Out of the 67 patients with Fistula in ano, 56 (83.6%)were males and 11 (16.4%) were females. Out of the 67 patients, 43(64.2%) had pain, 46(68.7%) had perianal swelling, 59(88.1%) people had complaints of discharge per anum. Antrior fidtula in ano was observed (43.3%) and a posterior opening was observed in 38 (56%). The fistulous tract was found to be simple in 42(62.69%) and complex in 25(37.31%). The overall predictive accuracy of Goodsall’s rule was 71.6%, The predictive accuracy was 75.86% with anterior fistula in ano and 68.42% with posterior fistula in ano. MRI was able to accurately delineate the course of the tract in 92.5%. MR fistulogram had a sensitivity of 93.8% (95% CI) - 93.8% (91.4% - 96.2%)Conclusion: We conclude that the overall accuracy of Goodsall's rule in predicting the course of the fistulous tract is 72% and the predictive accuracy was high for anterior fistulae and complex fistulae. Goodsall's rule can thus be used as tool for the pre operative evaluation of patients with fistula in ano and also can help in assessing the necessity of MR fistulogram in complex cases.",

      "abstract": "Crohn's disease (CD) poses significant morbidity, underscoring the need for effective, non-invasive inflammatory assessment using magnetic resonance enterography (MRE). This literature review evaluates recent publications on the role of deep learning in improving MRE for CD assessment. We searched MEDLINE/PUBMED for studies that reported the use of deep learning algorithms for assessment of CD activity. The study was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. The risk of bias was evaluated using the QUADAS-2 tool. Five eligible studies, encompassing 468 subjects, were identified. Our study suggests that diverse deep learning applications, including image quality enhancement, bowel segmentation for disease burden quantification, and 3D reconstruction for surgical planning are useful and promising for CD assessment. However, most of the studies are preliminary, retrospective studies, and have a high risk of bias in at least one category. Future research is needed to assess how deep learning can impact CD patient diagnostics, particularly when considering the increasing integration of such models into hospital systems.",

The enteric phase CE-T1W MRE images of each patient were reconstructed with conventional reconstruction and no image filter (original), with conventional reconstruction and image filter (filtered), and with a prototype version of AIR<sup>TM</sup> Recon DL 3D (DLR), which were then reformatted into the axial plane to generate six image sets per patient. Two radiologists independently assessed the images for overall image quality, contrast, sharpness, presence of motion artifacts, blurring, and synthetic appearance for qualitative analysis, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was measured for quantitative analysis.<h4>Results</h4>The mean scores of the DLR image set with respect to overall image quality, contrast, sharpness, motion artifacts, and blurring in the coronal and axial images were significantly superior to those of both the filtered and original images (<i>P</i> < 0.001). However, the DLR images showed a significantly more synthetic appearance than the other two images (<i>P</i> < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in all scores between the original and filtered images (<i>P</i> > 0.05).

In the NORDTREAT cohort study, a Nordic prospective multicentre study, we aim to identify novel molecular biomarkers of diagnostic value by assessing the diagnostic test accuracy (cross-sectionally), as well as the prognostic utility when used as prognostic markers in the long-term (cohort study). In the diagnostic test accuracy study, the primary outcome is a successful diagnosis using one or more novel index tests at baseline compared with the ECCO criteria as the reference standard. The composite outcome of the prognostic utility study is 'severe IBD' within 52 weeks from inclusion, defined as one or more of the following three events: IBD-related surgery, IBD-related hospitalisation or IBD-related death.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>We aim to recruit 800 patients referred on suspicion of IBD to this longitudinal observational study, a collaboration between 11 inclusion sites in Denmark, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. Inclusion will occur from February 2022 until December 2023 with screening and baseline visits for all participants and three outcome visits at weeks 12, 26 and 52 after baseline for IBD-diagnosed patients. Biological material (blood, faeces, biopsies, urine and hair), clinical data and lifestyle information will be collected during these scheduled visits.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>This study will explore novel biomarkers to improve diagnostic accuracy and prediction of disease progression, thereby improving medical therapy and the quality of life for patients with IBD.The study is approved by the Ethics Committee (DK: S-20200051, v1.4, 16.10.2021; IS: VSNb2021070006/03.01, NO: 193064; SE: DNR 2021-05090) and the Danish Data Protecting Agency (20/54594).

Retrospective evidence suggests PFCs may be preventable. Objective We aimed to determine if early antitumour necrosis factor-alpha (anti-TNF⍺) therapy prevents PFC development in a well-characterised prospective cohort of paediatric patients with Crohn’s disease who were free from PFC at enrolment. Design RISK was a multicentre inception cohort of children newly diagnosed with Crohn’s disease. We included all patients who had never experienced PFCs 30 days after study enrolment. We conducted nearest-neighbour propensity score-matched triad analyses. Matching was performed to balance patient characteristics across three mutually exclusive treatment groups based on therapy prior to either PFC development or the end of the observation period. Results Among 873 patients without perianal fistula, 447 matched patients were included (149 per treatment group). The presence of non-penetrating perianal lesions (large skin tags, ulcers and/or fissures) was significantly associated with PFC development, with 4-fold greater odds of PFC (OR 4.08, 95% CI (95% CI) 1.70 to 9.78; p=0.0016). Early anti-TNF⍺ therapy was associated with an 82% decrease in the odds of PFC (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.66; p=0.01). Among those with perianal lesions, anti-TNF⍺ therapy was associated with 94% reduced odds of PFC development (OR 0.055, 95% CI 0.006 to 0.50; p=0.010). No other treatment group was associated with reduced risk of PFC. Conclusion Early anti-TNF therapy prevents perianal fistula development, especially among patients at increased risk.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ileoanal pouch anastomosis is the surgical treatment of choice for patients with intractable ulcerative colitis. Perianal disease is a feature that is often present in Crohn’s disease and infrequently in ulcerative colitis. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to identify the incidence and factors associated with the development of postoperative perianal fistula in patients undergoing ileoanal pouch anastomosis for ulcerative colitis. DESIGN: A prospectively collected database at the time of surgery with subsequent follow-up was utilized. SETTING: The study was conducted at a high-volume single institution. PATIENTS: We studied a series of 475 consecutive patients with preoperative diagnosis of ulcerative colitis who underwent ileoanal pouch anastomosis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The incidence of postoperative perianal fistula and the factors correlating with its development were primary outcome measures of the study. RESULTS: The overall number of patients developing perianal fistulas was 44 of 475 (9%). Eleven patients with perianal fistula (25%) required return to ileostomy, of which 7 had pouch excision. Patients who developed a postoperative perianal fistula had a younger age at the onset of disease, had a lower age at index surgery, and were more likely to be subsequently classified as indeterminate colitis or Crohn’s disease. Patients developing perianal fistulas were also more likely to develop partial dehiscence or stricture of the ileoanal anastomosis. LIMITATIONS: This study spans nearly 40 years during which the surgical procedure evolved. CONCLUSIONS: Young age at the onset of disease, lower age at surgery, and postoperative diagnosis of Crohn’s disease and indeterminate colitis were the factors correlating with perianal fistulas. Delayed healing of the ileoanal anastomosis with partial separation and/or stricture also correlated with the onset of perianal fistulas. The severity of rectal inflammation at the time of surgery or the presence of stapled versus handsewn anastomosis did not correlate with the development of perianal fistulas.

FÍSTULA PERIANAL POSTERIOR A RESERVORIO ILEOANAL EN PACIENTES CON COLITIS ULCERATIVA: UNA REVISIÓN DE 475 PACIENTES OPERADOS EN UN CENTRO PRINCIPAL DE EII ANTECEDENTES: El reservorio ileoanal es el tratamiento quirúrgico de elección para los pacientes con colitis ulcerativa intratable. La enfermedad perianal es una característica que a menudo está presente en la enfermedad de Crohn y con poca frecuencia en la colitis ulcerativa. OBJETIVO: El objetivo del estudio es identificar la incidencia y los factores asociados con el desarrollo de fístula perianal posoperatoria en pacientes sometidos a reservorio ileoanal por colitis ulcerativa. DISEÑO: Base de datos recopilada prospectivamente en el momento de la cirugía con seguimiento subsecuente. ENTORNO CLÍNICO: El estudio se llevó a cabo en una única institución de gran volumen. PACIENTES: Estudiamos una serie de 475 pacientes consecutivos con diagnóstico preoperatorio de colitis ulcerativa a los que se les realizó reservorio ileoanal. PRINCIPALES MEDIDAS DE VALORACIÓN: La incidencia de fístula perianal posoperatoria y los factores que se correlacionan con su desarrollo fueron las principales medidas de resultado del estudio. RESULTADOS: El número total de pacientes que desarrollaron fístulas perianales fue 44 de 475 (9%). Once pacientes con fístula perianal (25%) requirieron volver a la ileostomía, de los cuales 7 tuvieron resección del reservorio. Los pacientes que desarrollaron fístula perianal posoperatoria tenían edad más temprana al inicio de la enfermedad, menor edad en el momento de la cirugía inicial y tenían más probabilidades de ser clasificados posteriormente como colitis indeterminada o enfermedad de Crohn. Los pacientes que desarrollaron fístulas perianales también fueron más propensos a desarrollar dehiscencia parcial o estenosis de la anastomosis ileoanal. LIMITACIONES: Este estudio abarca casi 40 años durante los cuales ha evolucionado el procedimiento quirúrgico. CONCLUSIONES: Edad temprana al inicio de la enfermedad, menor edad al momento de la cirugía, diagnóstico postoperatorio de enfermedad de Crohn y colitis indeterminada fueron los factores que se correlacionaron con las fístulas perianales. El retraso en la cicatrización de la anastomosis ileoanal con separación parcial y/o estenosis también se correlacionó con la aparición de fístulas perianales. La gravedad de la inflamación rectal en el momento de la cirugía o la presencia de anastomosis con grapas versus anastomosis manual no se correlacionó con el desarrollo de fístulas perianales.

      "abstract": "Perianal fistula is one of the most common complications in Crohn’s disease, and various medical and surgical treatments are being tried. The aim of this study was to compare the perianal fistula closure rates following treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents or autologous adipose tissue-derived stem cell (auto-ASC) transplantation with Crohn’s disease (CD). CD patients who underwent seton placement for perianal fistula from January 2015 to December 2019 at a tertiary referral center were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups, one that received sequential treatments with anti-TNF agents (anti-TNF group) and the other that underwent auto-ASC transplantation (stem cell group). Clinical variables and fistula closure rates were compared in the two groups. Of the 69 patients analyzed, 39 were treated with anti-TNF agents and 30 underwent auto-ASC transplantation. Compared with the stem cell group, patients in the anti-TNF group were older (p=0.028), were more frequently male (p=0.019), had fistulas with more penetrating behavior (p=0.002), had undergone surgery more frequently (p=0.010), and had a shorter interval from seton placement to intended treatment (p<0.001). During a median follow-up of 46 months (range, 30–52.5 months), fistula closure rates were significantly faster (83.3% vs. 23.1%, p<0.001), and the mean interval from seton placement to fistula closure significantly shorter (14 vs. 37 months, p<0.001) in the stem cell than in the anti-TNF group. Three patients experienced fistula recurrence, all in the stem cell group. Medical treatment using anti-TNF agents and auto-ASC transplantation are feasible treatment options after seton placement for Crohn’s perianal fistula. However, the closure rate was significantly faster and the time to closure significantly shorter in patients who underwent auto-ASC transplantation than medical treatment. This study was retrospectively registered and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Asan Medical Center, number 2020-1059.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nCarcinoma associated with perianal fistula in Crohn's disease is a pending threat for patients. This study was aimed to improve understanding and facilitate development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA retrospective case-control study was conducted at four German hospitals. The analysis included forty patients with proven malignancy associated with perianal Crohn's fistulas and forty randomly-selected controls with fistulizing perianal Crohn's disease. Differences between groups were analysed and multivariate calculations performed to describe risk factors for oncological outcomes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHistology revealed adenocarcinoma in 33/40 patients and squamous cell carcinoma in 7/40 patients. Compared to fistula patients without carcinoma, patients with malignancies associated to fistula had a diagnosis of Crohn's disease in younger age. Crohn's disease lasted longer in patients with malignancy (25.8 ± 9.0 vs. 19.6 ± 10.4; p=0.006).Fistula related findings differed significantly between both groups. Signs for complicated and severe fistulation including complex anatomy and chronic activity occurred significantly more often in patients with malignancy associated to fistula.Significant multivariate hazard ratios for overall mortality and progression-free survival were shown for histologic type of cancer, metastatic disease and R1 resection. Overall survival (OS) was 45.1±28.6 months and the 5-year survival rate was 65%.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma associated with perianal fistula in Crohn's disease, fistula characteristics determine risk for malignancy. Early diagnosis influences outcomes, while treatment of chronic fistula activity may be key to preventing malignancy. Expert multimodal therapy is paramount for successful treatment of perianal fistula-associated malignancies.",

Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) were segmented using three approaches: (1) whole-abdomen segmentation (T-VAT/SAT); (2) single-slice segmentation of adipose tissue surrounding the most severely affected bowel segment (LL-VAT/SAT); and (3) single-slice segmentation at individual vertebral levels from L3 to S2 (V-VAT/SAT).

Feature selection was performed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), followed by construction of logistic regression models. A combined model incorporating radiomics and clinical features was also constructed. Model performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), and decision curve analysis (DCA).<h4>Results</h4>In the external test set, the T-VAT model achieved an AUC of 0.877 (95% CI: 0.718-0.937) and an AUPRC of 0.657 (95% CI: 0.368-1.000), performing better than other VAT- and SAT-based models.

DCA further demonstrated that the combined model provided greater net clinical benefit compared with both the T-VAT and clinical models.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Radiomics based on whole-abdominal VAT segmentation achieved the best prognostic performance for predicting disease progression in CD.

      "abstract": "The radiological diagnosis of Crohn's disease (CD)-related anorectal cancer is difficult; it is often found in advanced stages and has a poor prognosis because of the difficulty of curative surgery. However, there are no studies on predicting the diagnosis of CD-related cancer. The present study aimed to develop a predictive model to diagnose CD cancerous lesions more accurately in a way that can be interpreted by clinicians. Patients with CD who developed anorectal CD lesions at Hyogo Medical University (Nishinomiya, Japan) between March 2009 and June 2022 were included in the present study. T2-weighted and T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images were utilized for our analysis. Images of anorectal lesions were segmented using open-source 3D Slicer software, and radiomic features were extracted using PyRadiomics. Six machine learning models were investigated and compared: i) Support vector machine; ii) naive Bayes; iii) random forest; iv) light gradient boosting machine; v) extremely randomized trees; vi) and regularized greedy forest (RGF). SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were calculated to assess the extent to which each radiomic feature contributed to the model's predictions compared to baseline, represented as the average of the model's predictions for all test data. The T2-weighted images of 28 patients with anorectal cancer and 40 non-cancer patients were analyzed and the contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images of 22 cancer and 40 non-cancer patients. The model with the highest area under the curve (AUC) was the RGF-based model constructed using T2-weighted image features, achieving an AUC of 0.944 (accuracy, 0.862; recall, 0.830). The SHAP-based model explanation suggested a strong association between the diagnosis of CD-related anorectal cancer and features such as complex lesion texture; greater pixel separation within the same coronal cross-section; larger, randomly distributed clumps of pixels with the same signal intensity; and a more spherical lesion shape on T2-weighted images. The MRI radiomics-based RGF model demonstrated outstanding performance in predicting CD-related anorectal cancer.

      "abstract": "This study aims to assess the effectiveness of radiomics signatures obtained from dual-energy computed tomography enterography (DECTE) in the evaluation of mucosal healing (MH) in patients diagnosed with Crohn's disease (CD). In this study, 106 CD patients with a total of 221 diseased intestinal segments (79 with MH and 142 non-MH) from two medical centers were included and randomly divided into training and testing cohorts at a ratio of 7:3. Radiomics features were extracted from the enteric phase iodine maps and 40-kev and 70-kev virtual monoenergetic images (VMIs) of the diseased intestinal segments, as well as from mesenteric fat. Feature selection was performed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression. Radiomics models were subsequently established, and the accuracy of these models in identifying MH in CD was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The combined-iodine model formulated by integrating the intestinal and mesenteric fat radiomics features of iodine maps exhibited the most favorable performance in evaluating MH, with AUCs of 0.989 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.977-1.000) in the training cohort and 0.947 (95% CI 0.884-1.000) in the testing cohort. Patients categorized as high risk by the combined-iodine model displayed a greater probability of experiencing disease progression when contrasted with low-risk patients. The combined-iodine radiomics model, which is built upon iodine maps of diseased intestinal segments and mesenteric fat, has demonstrated promising performance in evaluating MH in CD patients.",

      "abstract": "Late gadolinium enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance (LGE-CMR) imaging plays a crucial role in assessing myocardial scar tissues, aiding in the diagnosis and prognosis of cardiovascular diseases. However, accurately classifying scar tissue severity into mild and severe remains a challenge due to low contrast, noise interference, and inter-patient variability in LGE-CMR images. Existing methods often rely on manual assessment or traditional deep learning models that struggle with precise myocardium localization and discriminative feature extraction from scarred regions. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel framework incorporating ScarYOLO, an optimized YOLOv8-based myocardium detection model, followed by contrastive myocardial scar learning (CMSL) for severity classification. ScarYOLO enhances myocardium localization accuracy, ensuring precise detection of scarred tissue. The detected myocardium is then processed using CMSL, which employs a fine-tuned Xception-based encoder trained on a labeled LGE-CMR dataset. CMSL leverages contrastive self-supervised learning to enhance feature representation and improve class separability between mild and severe scar regions. Additional dense layers and a classification head are appended to the encoder for final severity prediction. The proposed approach enhances myocardial scar detection accuracy while improving robustness in low-contrast LGE-CMR images. By leveraging ScarYOLO for precise segmentation and CMSL for effective classification, our model outperforms conventional deep learning methods in classifying scar tissue severity. Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in detection precision, classification accuracy, and model generalization, making it a reliable tool for automated myocardial scar assessment in clinical settings.",

New explainable machine learning (xML) techniques allow for systematic assessment of arrhythmia recurrence risk following catheter ablation. We aim to develop an xML algorithm that predicts recurrence and reveals key risk factors to facilitate better follow-up strategy after an ablation procedure.<h4>Methods</h4>We reconstructed pre-and post-ablation models of the left atrium (LA) from late gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance (LGE-MRI) for 67 patients. Patient-specific features (LGE-based measurements of pre/post-ablation arrhythmogenic substrate, LA geometry metrics, computational simulation results, and clinical risk factors) trained a random forest classifier to predict recurrent arrhythmia. We calculated each risk factor's marginal contribution to model decision making via SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP).<h4>Results</h4>The classifier accurately predicts post-ablation arrhythmia recurrence (mean receiver operating characteristic [ROC] area under the curve [AUC]: 0.80 ± 0.04; mean precision-recall [PR] AUC: 0.82 ± 0.08). SHAP analysis reveals that of 89 features tested, the key population risk factors for recurrence are: large left atrium, low LGE-quantified post-ablation scar in the atrial floor region, and previous attempts at direct current cardioversion. We also examine patient-specific recurrence predictions, since xML allows us to understand why a particular individual can have large prediction weights for some categories without tipping the balance towards an incorrect prediction. Finally, we validate our model in a completely new, 15-patient retrospective holdout cohort (80% correct).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our SHAP-based explainable machine learning approach is a proof-of-concept clinical tool to explain arrhythmia recurrence risk in patients who underwent ablation by combining patient-specific clinical profiles and LGE-derived data.",

PubMed, EMBASE and Scopus were systematically searched for English-language human studies evaluating AI for outcome and toxicity prediction in patients undergoing SBRT or SRS for solid tumors. Search terms included (\"Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy\" OR \"SBRT\" OR \"Stereotactic Radiosurgery\" OR \"SRS\" OR \"Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy\" OR \"SABR\") AND (\"Artificial Intelligence\" OR \"AI\" OR \"Machine Learning\" OR \"Deep Learning\" OR \"Radiomics\") AND (\"Response Prediction\" OR \"Response to Treatment\" OR \"Outcome Prediction\") AND (\"Toxicity\" OR \"Side Effects\" OR \"Treatment Toxicities\" OR \"Adverse Events\"). <b>Results:</b> The search yielded 29 eligible retrospective studies, published between 2020 and 2025. Eight studies addressed early-stage primary lung cancer, highlighting the potential of AI-based models in predicting radiation-induced pneumonitis, fibrosis and local control. Five studies investigated AI models for predicting hepatobiliary toxicity following SBRT for liver tumors. Sixteen studies involved SRS-treated patients with brain metastases or benign intracranial neoplasms (e.g., arteriovenous malformations, vestibular schwannomas, meningiomas), exploring AI algorithms for predicting treatment response and radiation-induced changes. In the results, AI might have been exploited to both reaffirm already known clinical predictors and to identify novel imaging, dosimetric or biological biomarkers. Examples include predicting radiation pneumonitis in lung cancer, residual liver function in hepatic tumors and local recurrence in brain metastases, thus supporting tailored treatment decisions. <b>Conclusions:</b> Combining AI with SBRT could greatly enhance personalized cancer care by predicting patient-specific outcomes and toxicity. AI models analyze complex datasets, including imaging and clinical data, to identify patterns that traditional methods may miss, thus enabling more accurate risk stratification and reducing variability in treatment planning. With further research and clinical validation, this integration could make radiotherapy safer, more effective and contribute to advancement in precision oncology.",

MRI (1.5-T, Siemens Sonata) was performed after standardised oral preparation (3% aqueous mannitol over 1 h). Coronal 2DtrueFISP (TR 283.8/TE 1.89/FOV400/10 mm slice) motility acquisitions covering the entire abdomen were performed in apnoea. For each patient, image analysis for assessment of gastric motility was performed both manually and using the dedicated software either the proximal (n = 5) or in the distal (n = 5) gastric corpus. The main quantitative endpoints (amplitude, frequency) describing gastric motility were compared using (paired) Student's t-Test. All motility curves qualitatively matched each other (10/10). No significant differences (P > 0.05) were found for amplitudes (mean: 18.17 mm manual; 17.78 mm software), contraction frequencies (5.1/min; 4.7/min) and mean lumen diameters (34.12 mm; 33.13 mm), respectively. Mean duration for a single measurement was significantly (P < 0.001) lower with the software (6.40 min manual technique; 1.40 min software assisted).

      "abstract": "Crohn’s disease (CD) is an inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. The disease behavior changes over time, and endoscopy is crucial in evaluating and monitoring the course of CD. To reduce the economic burden of patients and alleviate the discomfort associated with ineffective examination, it is necessary to fully understand the location, extent, and severity of intestinal stenosis in patients with CD before endoscopy. This study aimed to utilize imaging features of magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) to evaluate intestinal stenosis in patients with CD and to predict whether endoscopy could be passed. MRE data of patients with CD were collected, while age, gender, disease duration, and laboratory test parameters were also gathered. Two radiologists analyzed the images and assessed whether endoscopy could be passed based on the imaging performance. Imaging features of MRE were analyzed in groups based on endoscopy results. The readers evaluated the imaging performance for 86 patients to determine if endoscopy could be passed and performed a consistency test (compared between two readers k = 0.812, p = 0.000). In the univariate analysis, statistical differences were observed in the degree of T1WI enhancement, thickness of the intestine wall at the stenosis, and diameter of the upstream intestine between the two groups of whether endoscopy was passed. In multivariate logistic regression, the diameter of the upstream intestine was identified to be an independent factor in predicting whether endoscopy was passed or not (OR = 3.260, p = 0.046). The utilization of MRE signs for assessing the passage of an endoscope through the narrow segment revealed that the diameter of the upstream intestine emerged as an independent predictor of endoscopic passage. Before performing an endoscopy, MRE can aid in evaluating the passage of the endoscope. This retrospective study explored the imaging features of MRE to evaluate intestinal stenosis in patients with Crohn’s disease and determined that the diameter of the upstream intestine of the stenotic segment was an independent predictor in assessing endoscopic passage. • Endoscopy is crucial in evaluating and monitoring the course of Crohn’s disease. • The diameter of the upstream intestine of the stenotic segment was an independent predictor in assessing endoscopic passage. • MRE can aid in evaluating the passage of the endoscope in stenotic segments of Crohn’s disease.",

This semiautomated software is able to assess the technical parameters automatically, but the visual assessment is still performed by the radiologist. There was a significant reduction in the reporting time of prostate mpMRI quality according to PI-QUAL using the dedicated software program compared to manual filling (5′54″ versus 7′59″; p = 0.005).

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>This narrative review examines the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in bowel sound analysis for the diagnosis and management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, presents a significant clinical burden due to its unpredictable course, variable symptomatology, and reliance on invasive procedures for diagnosis and disease monitoring. Despite advances in imaging and biomarkers, tools such as colonoscopy and fecal calprotectin remain costly, uncomfortable, and impractical for frequent or real-time assessment. Meanwhile, bowel sounds-an overlooked physiologic signal-reflect underlying gastrointestinal motility and inflammation but have historically lacked objective quantification. With recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and acoustic signal processing, there is growing interest in leveraging bowel sound analysis as a novel, non-invasive biomarker for detecting IBD, monitoring disease activity, and predicting disease flares. This approach holds the promise of continuous, low-cost, and patient-friendly monitoring, which could transform IBD management.<h4>Objectives</h4>This narrative review assesses the clinical utility, methodological rigor, and potential future integration of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven bowel sound analysis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), with a focus on its potential as a non-invasive biomarker for disease activity, flare prediction, and differential diagnosis.<h4>Methods</h4>This manuscript reviews the potential of AI-powered bowel sound analysis as a non-invasive tool for diagnosing, monitoring, and managing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as colonoscopy and biomarkers, are often invasive, costly, and impractical for real-time monitoring. The manuscript explores bowel sounds, which reflect gastrointestinal motility and inflammation, as an alternative biomarker by utilizing AI techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transformers, and gradient boosting. We analyze data on acoustic signal acquisition (e.g., smart T-shirts, smartphones), signal processing methodologies (e.g., MFCCs, spectrograms, empirical mode decomposition), and validation metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1 scores, AUC). Studies were assessed for clinical relevance, methodological rigor, and translational potential.<h4>Results</h4>Across studies enrolling 16-100 participants, AI models achieved diagnostic accuracies of 88-96%, with AUCs ≥ 0.83 and F1 scores ranging from 0.71 to 0.85 for differentiating IBD from healthy controls and IBS. Transformer-based approaches (e.g., HuBERT, Wav2Vec 2.0) consistently outperformed CNNs and tabular models, yielding F1 scores of 80-85%, while gradient boosting on wearable multi-microphone recordings demonstrated robustness to background noise. Distinct acoustic signatures were identified, including prolonged sound-to-sound intervals in Crohn's disease (mean 1232 ms vs. 511 ms in IBS) and high-pitched tinkling in stricturing phenotypes. Despite promising performance, current models remain below established biomarkers such as fecal calprotectin (~90% sensitivity for active disease), and generalizability is limited by small, heterogeneous cohorts and the absence of prospective validation.<h4>Conclusions</h4>AI-powered bowel sound analysis represents a promising, non-invasive tool for IBD monitoring. However, widespread clinical integration requires standardized data acquisition protocols, large multi-center datasets with clinical correlates, explainable AI frameworks, and ethical data governance. Future directions include wearable-enabled remote monitoring platforms and multi-modal decision support systems integrating bowel sounds with biomarker and symptom data. This manuscript emphasizes the need for large-scale, multi-center studies, the development of explainable AI frameworks, and the integration of these tools within clinical workflows. Future directions include remote monitoring using wearables and multi-modal systems that combine bowel sounds with biomarkers and patient symptoms, aiming to transform IBD care into a more personalized and proactive model.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Disease-related strictures are a common complication of Crohn's disease (CD). Cross-sectional imaging is widely used for their assessment, but definitions remain variable and non-standardised. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to identify commonly used imaging parameters, assess diagnostic performance, and evaluate consistency across studies.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a systematic review of ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT) studies on CD-associated strictures, searching MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane to January 1, 2025. We included prospective and retrospective studies of small-bowel CD strictures with surgical histopathology as reference standard. Summary data were extracted from published reports and pooled using a random-effects bivariate meta-analysis, which jointly models sensitivity and specificity while accounting for between-study heterogeneity. Exclusion criteria were pediatric populations, colonic and upper-GI strictures. Main outcomes were stricture definitions and diagnostic performance. The study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD420251032918.<h4>Findings</h4>Of the 9436 articles identified through the search, 30 met eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis, comprising 1866 patients with CD: 5 on US, 7 on CT, 8 on MRI, and the remaining assessed two techniques. Luminal narrowing (LN), bowel wall thickening (BWT), and pre-stenotic dilation (PSD) were the most common descriptors. 4 studies (13%) required all three; the remaining used LN or BWT alone, with PSD often considered optional (20/30 [77%]). Overall, 26.7% (8/30) of studies were judged at high or unclear risk of bias in at least one domain. Pooled sensitivity and specificity for US techniques to detect strictures were 0.88 (95% CI, 0.83-0.91) and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.79-0.91) (<i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0%), respectively. Pooled sensitivity and specificity for MRE were 0.82 (95% CI, 0.69-0.90) and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.44-0.95) (<i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 61.2%), and for CTE were 0.83 (95% CI, 0.73-0.90) and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.47-0.93) (<i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 58.8%), respectively.<h4>Interpretation</h4>High diagnostic accuracy was observed across imaging modalities, with no statistically significant difference among them, and only a minority of studies at risk of bias unlikely to affect these findings. Heterogeneity existed in cut-offs and parameter combinations used to define strictures. PSD does not appear essential for stricture diagnosis, which could simplify diagnostic protocols. Variations in histological criteria and limited evidence for some modalities may limit generalizability.<h4>Funding</h4>None.",

      "abstract": "The study aims were to develop fracture prediction models by using machine learning approaches and genomic data, as well as to identify the best modeling approach for fracture prediction. The genomic data of Osteoporotic Fractures in Men, cohort Study (n = 5,130), was analyzed. After a comprehensive genotype imputation, genetic risk score (GRS) was calculated from 1,103 associated SNPs for each participant. Data were normalized and split into a training set (80%) and a validation set (20%) for analysis. Random forest, gradient boosting, neural network, and logistic regression were used to develop prediction models for major osteoporotic fractures separately, with GRS, bone density and other risk factors as predictors. For model training, the synthetic minority over-sampling technique was used to account for low fracture rate, and 10-fold cross-validation was employed for hyperparameters optimization. In the testing set, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and accuracy were used to assess the model performance. The McNemar test was employed for pairwise comparisons to examine the accuracy difference between models. The results showed that the prediction performance of gradient boosting was the best, with AUC of 0.71 and an accuracy of 0.88, and the GRS ranked as the 7th most important variable in the model. The performance of random forest and neural network were also better than that of logistic regression. Pairwise comparisons showed that the accuracy difference between models was significant. This study suggested that improving fracture prediction can be achieved by incorporating genetic profiling and by utilizing the gradient boosting approach.",

This study aimed to develop a deep learning model based on baseline intestinal ultrasound (IUS) images and clinical information to predict mucosal healing. Consecutive CD patients who underwent pretreatment IUS were retrospectively recruited at a tertiary hospital. A total of 1548 IUS images of longitudinal diseased bowel segments were collected and divided into a training cohort and a test cohort. A convolutional neural network model was developed to predict mucosal healing after one year of standardized treatment. The model’s efficacy was validated using the five-fold internal cross-validation and further tested in the test cohort. A total of 190 patients (68.9% men, mean age 32.3 ± 14.1 years) were enrolled, consisting of 1038 IUS images of mucosal healing and 510 images of no mucosal healing. The mean area under the curve in the test cohort was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.68–0.78), with the mean sensitivity of 68.1% (95% CI: 60.5–77.4%), specificity of 69.5% (95% CI: 60.1–77.2%), positive prediction value of 80.0% (95% CI: 74.5–84.9%), negative prediction value of 54.8% (95% CI: 48.0–63.7%). Heat maps showing the deep-learning decision-making process revealed that information from the bowel wall, serous surface, and surrounding mesentery was mainly considered by the model. We developed a deep learning model based on IUS images to predict mucosal healing in CD with notable accuracy. Further validation and improvement of this model with more multi-center, real-world data are needed. Predicting treatment response in CD is essential to making an optimal therapeutic regimen. In this study, a deep-learning model using pretreatment ultrasound images and clinical information was generated to predict mucosal healing with an AUC of 0.73. Response to medication treatment is highly variable among patients with CD. High-resolution IUS images of the intestinal wall may hide significant characteristics for treatment response.

Results of our previous pilot study demonstrated the efficacy and safety of local injection of autologous microfragmented adipose tissue (MFat) in this setting. This study aims to evaluate the long-term follow-up results in the same cohort of patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nData on clinical and radiological remission and surgical recurrence rates were prospectively collected on the 15 patients with complex fistulizing PCD refractory to combined bio-surgical therapy, originally treated with local MFat injection, with a mean 6.7 years follow-up.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn our previous study, at 24-week follow-up, combined remission was reported in 66.7% of patients, while clinical remission was achieved in 93% of cases. At a 6.7-year follow-up, 9 of the 10 healed patients maintained remission. The patient with recurrence was successfully reoperated. Three out of 5 patients who failed primary combined remission were retreated, with 2 obtaining combined remission and 1 failing. One patient refused any subsequent treatment due to good quality of life. The last patient presented delayed healing at a 1-year follow-up. Overall success rate after rescue therapy at the final follow-up reached 86.6%. Safety was maintained throughout all follow-up periods.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis is the longest follow-up published trial on MFat injection for PCD. Our results show that patients who achieved closure in the first 24 weeks sustained response at long-term evaluation. In addition, there may be a rationale in repeating treatment as rescue therapy in not responding to patients.",

Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1:1) to groups given placebo or 3 mg, 6 mg, 12 mg, or 24 mg upadacitinib twice daily, or 24 mg once daily, and evaluated by ileocolonoscopy at weeks 12 or 16 of the induction period. Patients who completed week 16 were re-randomized to a 36-week period of maintenance therapy with upadacitinib. The primary endpoints were clinical remission at week 16 and endoscopic remission at week 12 or 16 using multiple comparison procedure and modeling and the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, with a 2-sided level of 10%.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong the 220 patients in the study, clinical remission was achieved by 13% of patients receiving 3 mg upadacitinib, 27% of patients receiving 6 mg upadacitinib (P<.1 vs placebo), 11% of patients receiving 12 mg upadacitinib, and 22% of patients receiving 24 mg upadacitinib twice daily, and 14% of patients receiving 24 mg upadacitinib once daily, vs 11% of patients receiving placebo; endoscopic remission was achieved by 10% (P<.1 vs placebo), 8%, 8% (P<.1 vs placebo), 22% (P<.01 vs placebo), and 14% (P<.05 vs placebo) of patients receiving upadacitinib, respectively, vs none of the patients receiving placebo. Endoscopic but not clinical remission increased with dose during the induction period. Efficacy was maintained for most endpoints through week 52. During the induction period, patients in the upadacitinib groups had higher incidences of infections and serious infections versus placebo. Patients in the twice-daily 12 mg and 24 mg upadacitinib groups had significant increases in total, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, compared with patients in the placebo group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn a phase 2 trial of patients with CD, upadacitinib induced endoscopic remission in a significant proportion of patients, compared with placebo.

      "abstract": "Despite the fact that perianal fistulas are associated with significant morbidity and impaired quality of life, their prevalence in Europe is unknown. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of perianal fistulas in Europe, overall and according to etiology. Two independent literature reviews were performed using different search strategies to maximize the identification of potentially relevant studies. Data from relevant articles were used to estimate the prevalence of perianal fistulas in Europe. The robustness of the estimate was evaluated using data from a large population-based database from the UK. A total of 26 studies provided epidemiological data on perianal fistulas, of which 16 provided suitable data to estimate the prevalence. Estimations using these data yielded a total prevalence of 1.69 per 10,000 population. Cryptoglandular infection and Crohn’s disease (CD) were the predominant etiologies, with prevalence rates at 0.86 and 0.76 per 10,000 population, respectively. Comparison of prevalence data from the UK population-based database with the European population resulted in a standardized prevalence estimate of all perianal fistulas of 1.83 per 10,000 population, confirming the robustness of the literature-based estimate. Although in terms of incidence cryptoglandular fistulas were clearly predominant, the prevalence of fistulas in CD and cryptoglandular infection appeared more balanced. This is due to the longer duration and higher frequency of relapses of fistulas in CD. The estimated prevalence implies that perianal fistulas meet the criteria to be considered as a rare condition in Europe (prevalence less than 5 per 10,000 population).

Abnormal expression of defensins was shown in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but it is not clear whether this is a primary defect. We investigated the impact of anti-inflammatory therapy with infliximab on the mucosal gene expression of AMPs in IBD. Methodology/Principal Findings Mucosal gene expression of 81 AMPs was assessed in 61 IBD patients before and 4–6 weeks after their first infliximab infusion and in 12 control patients, using Affymetrix arrays. Quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR and immunohistochemistry were used to confirm microarray data. The dysregulation of many AMPs in colonic IBD in comparison with control colons was widely restored by infliximab therapy, and only DEFB1 expression remained significantly decreased after therapy in the colonic mucosa of IBD responders to infliximab. In ileal Crohn's disease (CD), expression of two neuropeptides with antimicrobial activity, PYY and CHGB, was significantly decreased before therapy compared to control ileums, and ileal PYY expression remained significantly decreased after therapy in CD responders. Expression of the downregulated AMPs before and after treatment (DEFB1 and PYY) correlated with villin 1 expression, a gut epithelial cell marker, indicating that the decrease is a consequence of epithelial damage. Conclusions/Significance Our study shows that the dysregulation of AMPs in IBD mucosa is the consequence of inflammation, but may be responsible for perpetuation of inflammation due to ineffective clearance of microorganisms.",

      "abstract": "\n \n \n Intestinal fibrosis represents a significant complication of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). An urgent need is present for the identification of pathways and markers involved in fibrogenesis to prevent and intervene with intestinal fibrosis. As intestinal fibrosis mainly occurs in the intestinal deeper layers, mucosal biopsies for studies in intestinal fibrosis are of limited information. Therefore, characterisation of the relative contribution of innate and adaptive immune cells in the mucosa and deeper layers in fibrotic distal ileum of Crohn’s disease (CD) patients was performed.\n \n \n \n Seventeen CD patients undergoing right hemicolectomy (RHC) for stricturing disease and 6 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients undergoing RHC were recruited. The resected ileum was divided in macroscopically inflamed and fibrotic tissue and single-cell suspensions were made from mucosal and deeper intestinal layers for immune cell characterisation with flow cytometry. For comparison, proximal unaffected CD tissue and control ileum from CRC patients was included. Fibrosis and inflammation were confirmed on HE stained histological sections. Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test between CD samples and Kruskal–Wallis testing with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test compared with CRC ileum were performed.\n \n \n \n From 12 CD patients, an additional macroscopically inflamed region could be identified next to the fibrotic area, with a decreased fibrosis score as compared with the fibrotic area (4.00 vs. 6.00, p = 0.016) (Figure 1). Both fibrotic and inflamed regions had increased inflammation as compared with proximal unaffected CD and control non-IBD ileum (score: 4.00 and 4.50 vs. 1.00 and 0.00, p < 0.001 for all). In the inflamed ileum, no differences in immune populations were observed between mucosa and deeper layers, reflecting the transmural nature of CD. In contrast, CD19+ B cells were specifically enriched in the mucosa of fibrotic ileum, as compared with proximal CD mucosa (32.20 vs. 20.40% of CD45+ cells, p = 0.008) (Figure 2). In the deeper layers of fibrostenotic CD ileum FcεR+ Siglec 8+ eosinophils (1.13 vs. 1.17 % of CD45+ cells, p = 0.027), mature CD11c+ dendritic cells (3.95 vs. 2.96 % of CD45+ cells, p = 0.042) and M2 CD206+ macrophages (0.35 vs. 0.18% of CD45+ cells, p < 0.001) were enriched as compared with the mucosa overlying the fibrotic tissue (Figure 3).\n \n \n \n \n \n \n These results argue that inflammation in the deeper intestinal layers is different from the inflammatory signature seen in mucosal inflamed regions. We here report alternative innate immune cells expanded specifically in the deeper intestinal layers of fibrostenotic CD ileum that could identify targets for new anti-fibrotic therapies.\n",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACTBackgroundThe burden of COVID-19 in Canada is unequally distributed geographically, with the largest number of cases and fatalities recorded in Québec and Ontario while other provinces experienced limited outbreaks. To date, however, no study has assessed how provincial epidemics have unfolded in a comparative perspective. This is essential to calibrate projections of the future course of the epidemic and plan health care resources for the second wave of infections.MethodsUsing newly released individual-level data collected by the Public Health Agency of Canada, we assess COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality across age and gender groups at the provincial level through a combination of demographic and survival analyses.ResultsQuébec has the highest absolute and per capita number of COVID-19 confirmed positive cases, hospitalizations and fatalities in all age groups. In each province, a higher number of women than men test positive for the disease, especially above age 80. Yet consistently across age groups, infected men are more likely to be hospitalized and enter intensive care than women do. These gender differences in hospitalisation rates account for the higher case fatality risk due to COVID-19 among men compared to women.InterpretationAlthough health care capacity across provinces has been sufficient to treat severe cases, we find that the main factor accounting for gender differences in COVID-19-related mortality is the need for hospitalization and intensive care, especially above age 80. This suggests a selection effect of severe cases requiring to be treated in a hospital setting that needs to be further investigated.",

Our experimental scattering results are consistent with first-principles calculations that bring to the fore a generic mechanism of close interplay between charge redistribution, lattice displacements, and orbital order.

Recently, there have been some efforts towards understanding these effects using states with a low principal quantum number that only have resonant dipole-dipole interactions. We perform experiments that exhibit black-body-induced dipole-dipole interactions for a state that also has a significant van der Waals interaction. Using an enhanced rate-equation model that captures some of the long-range properties of the dipolar interaction, we show that the initial degree of Rydberg excitation is dominated by the van der Waals interaction, while the observed linewidth at later times is dominated by the dipole-dipole interaction. We also point out some prospects for quantum simulation.",

The governing equations are formulated for any thermodynamic model with two intensive degrees of freedom, applied with the van der Waals' model and solved numerically in nondimensional form by finite-difference algorithms. After a brief summary of thermodynamic characteristics possessed by the van der Waals' model, and relevant to the present study, we proceed to the description of the results in terms of comparative graphs illustrating radial profiles of density, pressure and gravitational field. We complement them with graphs that compare the dependence of central and wall densities on gravitational number for both perfect-gas and van der Waals' models and that attest dramatically and unequivocally how the presence of molecular-attraction and -size terms removes questionable fluid-statics results systematically found accompanying the perfect-gas model in standard treatments. We also describe, within a very brief and preliminary digression, how the sanitising action of the mentioned terms affects the thermodynamics of the isothermal sphere by providing evidence of how the gravitational correction to entropy corresponding to the van der Waals' model makes sure that there is no risk of gravothermal catastrophes, negative specific heats, and thermal instabilities. Furthermore, we investigate the phenomenology related to self-gravitationally induced both liquid-gas phase equilibria and metastable-gas states and we describe how they arise naturally and self-consistently from the governing equations.

The reflectivity displays an unusual temperature and energy dependence in the far-infrared, which we show can only be explained by a collapse of the scattering rate at low temperature, resulting from the vicinity of a van Hove singularity near the Fermi energy. An analysis of the optical conductivity suggests that below 150 K a reduction in the available phase space for scattering takes place, resulting in long-lived quasiparticle excitations. We suggest that this reduction in phase space provides experimental evidence for a van Hove singularity close to the Fermi level. Our data furthermore indicates a very weak electron-phonon coupling. Combined this suggests that the superconducting transition temperature is set by the density of states associated with the van Hove singularity.",

It had developed under the founder Jacobus Cornelius Kapteyn into one of the leading astronomical research institutes in the world. When van Rhijn took over at the retirement of Kapteyn, it was in the process of coordinating Kapteyn's Plan of Selected Areas. Van Rhijn's research was solid and professional work, but in his papers he invariably stopped before discussing how his findings did fit into the larger scheme of things. He maybe was unimaginative but it did lack the link to the larger view towards the emerging picture of the structure of the Galaxy. Van Rhijn was unfortunate to be hampered throughout almost his complete directorate by factors, that severely limited his attempts to obtain more funding in spite of local support by his university. These were of course in the first place the Great Depression of the 1930s and the Second World War and its aftermath, while during most of the 1940s he suffered from tuberculosis. But also the remote location of Groningen compared to Leiden, where a major infrastructure led by three important protegees of Kapteyn was in place, and the governmental bias towards support for Leiden over Groningen was an important factor. Finally I examine the developments in the 1950s and the circumstances that made Adriaan Blaauw accept his appointment as van Rhijn's successor in 1957 and initiate the beginnings of the revival under his leadership.",

At variance, perfect primitive lattice matching of the constituent layers has also been reported in some vdW-heterostructures [3-5], highlighting the richness of interfaces in the 2D world. In this work, the determination of the nature of such interface, from first principles, is demonstrated. To do so, an extension of the Frenkel-Kontorova (FK) model [6] is presented, linked to first-principles calculations, and used to predict lattice coherency for a set of 56 vdW-heterostructures. Computational predictions agree with experiments, when available. New superlattices as well as perfectly-matching interfaces are predicted.",

We focus on the various sections of the gastrointestinal tract and how different modalities can aid in assessing current disease state and response to treatments. We also have a look at how newer sequences in cross-sectional imaging and ultrasonography can allow for better differentiation of disease activity (ie, fibrotic vs inflammatory) as well improve evaluation of small bowel, colonic and perianal disease. Furthermore, we examine how advanced image processing has the potential to allow radiology to be a surrogate for biomarkers. An example of this is explored when reviewing the ability of MR sequences to quantify visceral fat, which potentially plays a role in determining disease activity in Crohn's disease.

Results were assessed for relevant studies, with preference given to data from randomized, controlled studies. For each question, a core panel of 12 gastroenterologists defined the treatment target and developed statements, based on the literature, current guidelines, and relevant additional studies. The evidence supporting each statement was graded using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine: Levels of Evidence (March 2009). A modified Delphi process was used to refine statements and gain agreement from 54 Japanese specialists at in-person and online meetings conducted between October 2020 and April 2021.<h4>Results</h4>Seventeen statements were developed for treatment intensification in luminal CD (targeting endoscopic remission), six statements for treatment intensification in perianal/fistulizing CD (targeting healing of perianal lesions and complete closure of the fistula), six statements for treatment intensification in CD with small bowel stenosis (targeting resolution of obstructive symptoms), seven statements for treatment intensification after surgery (targeting endoscopic remission), and five statements for discontinuing or reducing the dose of treatment in patients with CD.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These statements provide guidance on how and when to intensify or de-intensify treatment for a broad spectrum of patients with CD.",

      "abstract": "Background The exploration of clinically relevant information in the free text of electronic health records (EHRs) holds the potential to positively impact clinical practice as well as knowledge regarding Crohn disease (CD), an inflammatory bowel disease that may affect any segment of the gastrointestinal tract. The EHRead technology, a clinical natural language processing (cNLP) system, was designed to detect and extract clinical information from narratives in the clinical notes contained in EHRs. Objective The aim of this study is to validate the performance of the EHRead technology in identifying information of patients with CD. Methods We used the EHRead technology to explore and extract CD-related clinical information from EHRs. To validate this tool, we compared the output of the EHRead technology with a manually curated gold standard to assess the quality of our cNLP system in detecting records containing any reference to CD and its related variables. Results The validation metrics for the main variable (CD) were a precision of 0.88, a recall of 0.98, and an F1 score of 0.93. Regarding the secondary variables, we obtained a precision of 0.91, a recall of 0.71, and an F1 score of 0.80 for CD flare, while for the variable vedolizumab (treatment), a precision, recall, and F1 score of 0.86, 0.94, and 0.90 were obtained, respectively. Conclusions This evaluation demonstrates the ability of the EHRead technology to identify patients with CD and their related variables from the free text of EHRs.

      "abstract": "Background Qingchang Tongluo Decoction (QTF) is clinically used for the treatment of intestinal fibrosis in Crohn’s Disease (CD). However, the role of QTF in CD-associated fibrosis and its potential pharmacological mechanism remains unclear. Purpose The objective of this study was to elucidate the potential mechanism of QTF in treating CD-associated fibrosis, employing a combination of bioinformatics approaches — encompassing network pharmacology and molecular docking — complemented by experimental validation. Methods To investigate the material basis and potential protective mechanism of QTF, a network pharmacology analysis was conducted. The core components and targets of QTF underwent molecular docking analysis to corroborate the findings obtained from network pharmacology. In vitro, a colon fibrotic model was established by stimulating IEC-6 cells with 10 ng/mL of transforming growth factor(TGF-β1). In vivo, an intestinal fibrosis model was induced in BALB/c mice by TNBS. The role of QTF in inhibiting the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway was investigated through RT-qPCR, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry staining, and immunofluorescence staining. Results Network pharmacology analysis revealed that QTF could exert its protective effect. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that Flavone and Isoflavone might be the key components of the study. Additionally, AKT1, IL-6, TNF, and VEGFA were identified as potential therapeutic targets. Furthermore, experimental validation and molecular docking were employed to corroborate the results obtained from network pharmacology. RT-qPCR, Immunofluorescence, and Western blotting results demonstrated that QTF significantly improved colon function and inhibited pathological intestinal fibrosis in vivo and in vitro. Conclusion Through the application of network pharmacology, molecular docking, and experimental validation, QTF could be confirmed to inhibit the proliferation of intestinal fibroblasts associated with CD and reduce the expression of Collagen I and VEGFA. This effect is achieved through the attenuation of ECM accumulation, primarily via the inhibition of the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway.",

      "abstract": "Crohn’s disease (CD) patients require varying levels of supportive care. In order to facilitate caregivers and nurses in precisely evaluating the caregiving requirements of these patients, we developed the CD-specific Care Needs Scale (CD-CNS). This study employed a mixed-methods approach, integrating qualitative and quantitative methodologies. The initial items of the scale were developed through qualitative interviews, Delphi expert consultation, and literature review, while the final items were refined through clinical testing. Qualitative interviews were conducted based on the supportive care needs framework and Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, and scale items were constructed through a literature search and qualitative interviews. The initial version of the scale with 45 items was obtained after the items were verified and modified by expert consultation. A total of 250 CD patients admitted to the gastroenterology department of a hospital in China were selected for verification of the initial version of the scale. A self-designed general questionnaire was used to obtain patients’ medical history and sociodemographic data, and the Chinese version of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) was used as the criterion. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed on the CD-CNS to evaluate the dimensions, factor structure, reliability, criterion validity, and construct validity. EFA identified 5 dimensions and retained 27 items with strong internal consistency reliability (α = 0.940). The Cronbach’s α coefficients for each dimension ranged from 0.824 to 0.921. Criterion validity was assessed using Spearman’s coefficient, which demonstrated a significant correlation with the IBDQ (P < 0.050). The test-retest reliability for each dimension after two weeks ranged from 0.655 to 0.895. We developed and validated a new scale that can be used to assess the care needs of CD patients. This new tool can guide the specific supportive care of CD patients. This study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Second Hospital of Nanjing (2021-LS-ky-022). The study was duly registered and approved online through the Trial Center of the Second Hospital of Nanjing in 2021. Confidentiality was ensured by anonymizing all the data. The entire study process was conducted under the supervision of the Ethics Committee of Nanjing Second Hospital. Informed consent was obtained from the patients, and each patient volunteered and agreed to participate.",

In this thesis, we investigate the role of submodularity in provable non-convex optimization and validation of algorithms. A profound understanding which classes of functions can be tractably optimized remains a central challenge for non-convex optimization. By advancing the notion of submodularity to continuous domains (termed \"continuous submodularity\"), we characterize a class of generally non-convex and non-concave functions -- continuous submodular functions, and derive algorithms for approximately maximizing them with strong approximation guarantees. Meanwhile, continuous submodularity captures a wide spectrum of applications, ranging from revenue maximization with general marketing strategies, MAP inference for DPPs to mean field inference for probabilistic log-submodular models, which renders it as a valuable domain knowledge in optimizing this class of objectives. Validation of algorithms is an information-theoretic framework to investigate the robustness of algorithms to fluctuations in the input/observations and their generalization ability. We investigate various algorithms for one of the paradigmatic unconstrained submodular maximization problem: MaxCut. Due to submodularity of the MaxCut objective, we are able to present efficient approaches to calculate the algorithmic information content of MaxCut algorithms. The results provide insights into the robustness of different algorithmic techniques for MaxCut.",

An integral part of the hyperparameter-tuning process is the evaluation of model checkpoints, which is done through the use of \"validators\". In a supervised setting, these validators evaluate checkpoints by computing accuracy on a validation set that has labels. In contrast, in an unsupervised setting, the validation set has no such labels. Without any labels, it is impossible to compute accuracy, so validators must estimate accuracy instead. But what is the best approach to estimating accuracy? In this paper, we consider this question in the context of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Specifically, we propose three new validators, and we compare and rank them against five other existing validators, on a large dataset of 1,000,000 checkpoints. Extensive experimental results show that two of our proposed validators achieve state-of-the-art performance in various settings. Finally, we find that in many cases, the state-of-the-art is obtained by a simple baseline method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest empirical study of UDA validators to date.

      "doi": "",
      "abstract": "In Bayesian statistics, the marginal likelihood, also known as the evidence, is used to evaluate model fit as it quantifies the joint probability of the data under the prior. In contrast, non-Bayesian models are typically compared using cross-validation on held-out data, either through $k$-fold partitioning or leave-$p$-out subsampling. We show that the marginal likelihood is formally equivalent to exhaustive leave-$p$-out cross-validation averaged over all values of $p$ and all held-out test sets when using the log posterior predictive probability as the scoring rule. Moreover, the log posterior predictive is the only coherent scoring rule under data exchangeability. This offers new insight into the marginal likelihood and cross-validation and highlights the potential sensitivity of the marginal likelihood to the choice of the prior. We suggest an alternative approach using cumulative cross-validation following a preparatory training phase. Our work has connections to prequential analysis and intrinsic Bayes factors but is motivated through a different course.",

      "title": "Improving AEBS Validation Through Objective Intervention Classification Leveraging the Prediction Divergence Principle",
      "doi": "",
      "abstract": "The safety validation of automatic emergency braking system (AEBS) requires accurately distinguishing between false positive (FP) and true positive (TP) system activations. While simulations allow straightforward differentiation by comparing scenarios with and without interventions, analyzing activations from open-loop resimulations - such as those from field operational testing (FOT) - is more complex. This complexity arises from scenario parameter uncertainty and the influence of driver interventions in the recorded data. Human labeling is frequently used to address these challenges, relying on subjective assessments of intervention necessity or situational criticality, potentially introducing biases and limitations. This work proposes a rule-based classification approach leveraging the Prediction Divergence Principle (PDP) to address those issues. Applied to a simplified AEBS, the proposed method reveals key strengths, limitations, and system requirements for effective implementation. The findings suggest that combining this approach with human labeling may enhance the transparency and consistency of classification, thereby improving the overall validation process. While the rule set for classification derived in this work adopts a conservative approach, the paper outlines future directions for refinement and broader applicability. Finally, this work highlights the potential of such methods to complement existing practices, paving the way for more reliable and reproducible AEBS validation frameworks.",

      "abstract": "This work investigates the importance of verification and validation (V&V) to achieve predictive scale-resolving simulations (SRS) of turbulence, i.e., computations capable of resolving a fraction of the turbulent flow scales. Toward this end, we propose a novel but simple V&V strategy based on grid and physical resolution refinement studies that can be used even when the exact initial flow conditions are unknown, or reference data are unavailable. This is particularly relevant for transient and transitional flow problems, as well as for the improvement of turbulence models. We start by presenting a literature survey of results obtained with distinct SRS models for flows past circular cylinders. It confirms the importance of V&V by illustrating a large variability of results, which is independent of the selected mathematical model and Reynolds number. The proposed V&V strategy is then used on three representative problems of practical interest. The results illustrate that it is possible to conduct reliable verification and validation exercises with SRS models, and evidence the importance of V&V to predictive SRS of turbulence. Most notably, the data also confirm the advantages and potential of the proposed V&V strategy: separate assessment of numerical and modeling errors, enhanced flow physics analysis, identification of key flow phenomena, and ability to operate when the exact flow conditions are unknown or reference data are unavailable.",

Clinical trials in pfCD are increasingly using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) criteria as a primary endpoint, but there is heterogeneity in the radiological definition of a healed perianal fistula that currently limits our ability to perform meaningful meta-analyses of studies. Our aim is to standardise outcomes through the generation of an international consensus definition of a radiologically healed fistula.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>This international Delphi consensus study employs a two-part strategy.The first is a systematic review to identify a longlist of variables used to define radiological healing in pfCD. MRI-based indices used to score fistula severity and healing will be assessed for their methodological quality using Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN). The systematic review protocol will be conducted using COSMIN methodology and reported using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses.The second part will be an online Delphi consensus, guided by the results of the systematic review. Radiologists, gastroenterologists and colorectal surgeons with expertise in the management of pfCD will be invited to take part in two to three rounds of online surveys. Once an a priori threshold of >80% agreement is reached on individual radiological components used to define 'healing' and 'healed', a final meeting of key stakeholders will be organised to generate a consensus definition of a healed fistula.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>The study has been deemed exempt from a formal Research Ethics Committee review as no patients will participate directly in the consensus process, given the technical nature of the research question. The study is registered with the local R&D department (Reference RD24/007). Publication of this study will help standardise radiological endpoint measurement in clinical trials of pfCD and improve the synthesis and meta-analysis of comparative studies.<h4>Prospero registration number</h4>CRD42024504334.",

An instrument to measure cumulative structural damage to the bowel, which may predict long-term disability, is needed. The aim of this article is to outline the methods to develop an instrument that can measure cumulative bowel damage. The project is being conducted by the International Program to develop New Indexes in Crohn's disease (IPNIC) group. This instrument, called the Crohn's Disease Digestive Damage Score (the Lémann score), should take into account damage location, severity, extent, progression, and reversibility, as measured by diagnostic imaging modalities and the history of surgical resection. It should not be \"diagnostic modality driven\": for each lesion and location, a modality appropriate for the anatomic site (for example: computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging enterography, and colonoscopy) will be used. A total of 24 centers from 15 countries will be involved in a cross-sectional study, which will include up to 240 patients with stratification according to disease location and duration. At least 120 additional patients will be included in the study to validate the score. The Lémann score is expected to be able to portray a patient's disease course on a double-axis graph, with time as the x-axis, bowel damage severity as the y-axis, and the slope of the line connecting data points as a measure of disease progression. This instrument could be used to assess the effect of various medical therapies on the progression of bowel damage.",

      "abstract": "\n \n \n Strictures develop in over half of Crohn’s Disease (CD) patients and can lead to complaints of bowel obstruction, requiring treatment. A study showed that strictures and pre-stricture small bowel (SB) have lower motility measured with cine-MRI, compared to normal bowel in CD. However, stricture motility has not been correlated with disease duration or Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI). Investigating this correlation can provide insight in the physiologic behavior of a stricture in relation to the extent of bowel damage (disease duration) and clinical complaints (HBI). This could possibly support the clinician in treatment decisions. Our aim is to investigate correlations between stricture motility measured with cine-MRI and disease duration and HBI, respectively.\n \n \n \n At a tertiary center CD patients (≥18yrs) with SB strictures were included. Patients fasted 4 hours, after which they drank 1600 mL (2.5%-mannitol-solution) in 60 minutes prior to 3T MRI. All underwent coronal dynamic 2D bFFE scans of the most stenotic SB and the pre-stenotic dilation if present, during a 20-second expiration breath-hold. Bowel motility was assessed with a validated displacement mapping technique (GIQuant, Entrolytics, Motilent, UK). Strictures (wall thickening >3mm and ≥50% luminal reduction) and pre-stenotic dilations (luminal diameter >3cm) were delineated on a reference image and motility was quantified on a motility map within these regions of interest (ROI), producing a single, numerical motility score (Arbitrary Units=AU). Stricture and pre-stenotic dilation motility scores are presented in medians [IQR]. Correlation was tested between stricture motility, disease duration and HBI by means of spearman’s rank correlation test.\n \n \n \n Twenty-two patients (55% male, age 37yrs [IQR 25-55], disease duration 7yrs[IQR 4-12]) were included. SB stricture motility was 57AU[IQR 48-71]. Pre-stenotic dilation motility (n=6) was 131AU[IQR 88-340]. Disease duration and stricture motility showed no correlation(r=0.2, p=0.4). HBI and stricture motility were inversely correlated(r=-0.6, p<0.01).\n \n \n \n \n We found an inverse correlation between SB stricture motility and HBI. No correlation was found between SB stricture motility and disease duration. The inverse correlation between HBI and stricture motility suggests that lower motility is associated with poorer clinical condition. This finding can possibly lead to earlier endoscopic or surgical intervention, since it indicates lower motility is associated with poorer clinical condition. Interestingly, we also measured higher pre-stenotic dilation motility compared to stricture motility, presumably a physiological response of the pre-stenotic dilation to the distal stricture and ongoing proximal peristalsis.\n",

We aimed to identify how MH is defined in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD).<h4>Methods</h4>We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library from inception to December 2023 for phase 2 and 3 RCTs of advanced therapies in IBD.<h4>Results</h4>One hundred forty-four studies were included, 72 in UC and 72 in CD, published between 1997 and 2023. In UC, 64% (46/72) RCTs reported MH as an endpoint. 12 definitions of MH were found, from endoscopic assessment alone (35/46; 76%) to the more recent combination of histology and endoscopy (10/46; 22%). 96% (44/46) of studies used the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore. In CD, reporting of MH lagged behind UC, with only 12% (9/72) of trials specifically defining MH as an endpoint, 7 as \"absence of ulceration,\" 2 as Simplified Endoscopic Score for CD score ≤2 or 0. Histological assessment was performed in 3 RCTs of CD. Centralized reading of endoscopy was used in 48% (35/72) of RCTs of UC and 22% (16/72) of CD. Only 1 RCT included transmural healing as an endpoint.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A standard definition of MH in IBD is lacking. Definitions have evolved particularly in UC, which now includes the addition of histological evaluation. Transmural healing holds promise as a future target in CD. We support a greater standardization of definitions as we expect endpoints to become increasingly stringent and multimodal with computers automating the assessment.",

This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01541579. 212 patients were randomly assigned: 107 to Cx601 and 105 to placebo. A significantly greater proportion of patients treated with Cx601 versus placebo achieved combined remission in the ITT (53 of 107 [50%] vs 36 of 105 [34%]; difference 15·2%, 97·5% CI 0·2-30·3; p=0·024) and modified ITT populations (53 of 103 [51%] vs 36 of 101 [36%]; 15·8%, 0·5-31·2; p=0·021). 18 (17%) of 103 patients in the Cx601 group versus 30 (29%) of 103 in the placebo group experienced treatment-related adverse events, the most common of which were anal abscess (six in the Cx601 group vs nine in the placebo group) and proctalgia (five vs nine). Cx601 is an effective and safe treatment for complex perianal fistulas in patients with Crohn's disease who did not respond to conventional or biological treatments, or both. TiGenix.",

Based on a systematic literature review, statements were formed, discussed and approved in multiple rounds by the 20 working group participants. Consensus was defined as at least 80% agreement among voters. Evidence was assessed using the modified GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) criteria. Highest diagnostic accuracy can only be established if a combination of modalities is used. Drainage of sepsis is always first line therapy before initiating immunosuppressive treatment. Mucosal healing is the goal in the presence of proctitis. Whereas antibiotics and thiopurines have a role as adjunctive treatments in pCD, anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) is the current gold standard. The efficacy of infliximab is best documented although adalimumab and certolizumab pegol are moderately effective. Oral tacrolimus could be used in patients failing anti-TNF therapy. Definite surgical repair is only of consideration in the absence of luminal inflammation. Based on a multidisciplinary approach, items relevant for fistula management were identified and algorithms on diagnosis and treatment of pCD were developed.",

Clinical examination alone of perianal fistulae is unlikely to be sufficient in the context of complex pfCD, as patients are likely to have complex disease and are more likely to experience complications, treatment failure, and recurrent disease. Furthermore, the relapsing-remitting nature of Crohn's disease and our limited understanding of the pathogenesis of this potentially destructive disease necessitate regular examination and radiological assessment, often in the form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Recent advancements in diagnostic techniques have enhanced the accuracy and timeliness of pfCD diagnosis, facilitating better patient outcomes.

Perianal fistula classification was based on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging. The Likert satisfaction scale was assessed for patient satisfaction and the Cleveland Clinic Florida Faecal Incontinence (CCF-FI) scoring system was used for incontinence. Treatment outcome was determined based on success rate and postoperative faecal incontinence.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean age of the patients was 43 ± 13 years and 59 (78%) of them were male. Forty-seven (62%) patients had simple fistula. Acute and late complications were significantly higher in the hybrid seton group than in the laser group (p <0.001). According to the Likert satisfaction scale, the rate of unsatisfied patients was significantly higher in the laser group than in the hybrid seton group (p = 0.02). According to the CCF-FI scoring system, incontinence was significantly higher in the hybrid seton group than in the laser group (p = 0.01). Treatment failure was higher in the laser group (p = 0.03).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe laser method has lower intraoperative / postoperative complications, but higher treatment failure and lower patient satisfaction compared to the hybrid seton method.\n\n\nKEY WORDS\nAnal fistula, Fecal incontinence, Laser therapy, Outcome, Loose seton method.",

Patients with\nsuspected perianal fistulae underwent both TPUS and MRI.

      "abstract": "Abstract Background  Knee joint osteoarthritis (OA) is among the most prevalent degenerative diseases of the joints in the body. Various scoring system exists for grading OA, such as (1) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Osteoarthritis Knee Score (MOAKS), (2) clinical grading by Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), and (3) X-ray grading of the Kellgren–Lawrence grading system (K-L). Objectives  To study MRI findings and MOAKS scoring of knee OA and correlation with WOMAC and K-L scoring. Setting and Design  Cross-sectional study in hospital population. Methods and Material  A total 40 knee OA cases underwent an MRI of the knee. MOAKS scoring was done and compared with K-L grading and WOMAC scores. Statistical Analysis  Collected data were compiled systematically and interpreted using IBM SPSS statistics software 25.0. A p -value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Results  The mean total WOMAC score was 9. K-L grade 2 was the most prevalent X-ray grade. Bone marrow lesion (BML) and cartilage loss in MOAKS score were greater in the medial femorotibial region. A moderate positive correlation was noted between the WOMAC score and K-L grade; full-thickness articular cartilage loss score at the medial femorotibial joint (MFTJ) and WOMAC score; partial-thickness articular cartilage loss score at lateral femorotibial joint (LFTJ) and WOMAC total pain score. No correlation was found between BML and pain severity score. Conclusion Higher WOMAC scores were associated with higher grades of K-L scoring and score of cartilage loss (partial and full thickness) of the MOAKS scoring system. The rest of the features of the MOAKS score (BML score, osteophyte, and synovitis) had no significant association with pain severity and K-L grading.",

Leveraging the learned score function as a prior, here we introduce a way to sample data from a conditional distribution given the measurements, such that the model can be readily used for solving inverse problems in imaging, especially for accelerated MRI. In short, we train a continuous time-dependent score function with denoising score matching. Then, at the inference stage, we iterate between numerical SDE solver and data consistency projection step to achieve reconstruction. Our model requires magnitude images only for training, and yet is able to reconstruct complex-valued data, and even extends to parallel imaging. The proposed method is agnostic to sub-sampling patterns, and can be used with any sampling schemes. Also, due to its generative nature, our approach can quantify uncertainty, which is not possible with standard regression settings. On top of all the advantages, our method also has very strong performance, even beating the models trained with full supervision. With extensive experiments, we verify the superiority of our method in terms of quality and practicality.",

The model is verified for a range of values of Weissenberg number We by applying it to the benchmark problem of flow past a cylinder in a channel. The main application is to flow in an arteriovenous fistula, the geometry of which is based on patient-specific data. Results for Oldroyd-B fluids are compared with those for a Newtonian fluid as well as with data from patient-specific velocity MRI scans. Features such as streamlines and regions of recirculation are similar across a range of values of We and the Newtonian case. There is however a strong dependence of maximum wall shear stress on We, with values for the viscoelastic fluid in all cases being higher than that for the Newtonian case.",

Diffusion probabilistic models that learn data-driven priors can potentially assist in reducing acquisition time. However, they typically require large training datasets that can be prohibitively expensive to collect. Patch-based diffusion models have shown promise in learning effective data-driven priors over small real-valued datasets, but have not yet demonstrated clinical value in MRI. We extend the Patch-based Diffusion Inverse Solver (PaDIS) to complex-valued, multi-coil MRI reconstruction, and compare it against a state-of-the-art whole-image diffusion baseline (FastMRI-EDM) for 7x undersampled MRI reconstruction on the FastMRI brain dataset. We show that PaDIS-MRI models trained on small datasets of as few as 25 k-space images outperform FastMRI-EDM on image quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM, NRMSE), pixel-level uncertainty, cross-contrast generalization, and robustness to severe k-space undersampling. In a blinded study with three radiologists, PaDIS-MRI reconstructions were chosen as diagnostically superior in 91.7% of cases, compared to baselines (i) FastMRI-EDM and (ii) classical convex reconstruction with wavelet sparsity. These findings highlight the potential of patch-based diffusion priors for high-fidelity MRI reconstruction in data-scarce clinical settings where diagnostic confidence matters.",

      "abstract": "An arteriovenous fistula, created by artificially connecting segments of a patient's vasculature, is the preferred way to gain access to the bloodstream for kidney dialysis. The increasing power and availability of supercomputing infrastructure means that it is becoming more realistic to use simulations to help identify the best type and location of a fistula for a specific patient. We describe a 3D fistula model that uses the lattice Boltzmann method to simultaneously resolve blood flow in patient-specific arteries and veins. The simulations conducted here, comprising vasculatures of the whole forearm, demonstrate qualified validation against clinical data. Ongoing research to further encompass complex biophysics on realistic time scales will permit the use of human-scale physiological models for basic and clinical medicine.",

      "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2019.2949570",
      "abstract": "Over the past several decades, many different types of computational imaging approaches have been proposed for improving MRI. In this paper, we provide an overview of methods that assume that MRI Fourier data is linearly predictable. Linear prediction is well known in signal processing and may be most recognizable for its usefulness in speech processing and spectrum estimation applications. In MRI, linear predictability implies that data can be sampled below the conventional Nyquist rate, since unmeasured data may be imputed as a shift-invariant linear combination of measured samples. Linear predictive methods include some of the earliest methods in the computational MRI reconstruction field, some of the most widely utilized computational MRI methods in modern clinical practice, and some of the most flexible and versatile modern computational imaging approaches that are enabling unprecedented new styles of data acquisition. In addition, the concept of linear predictability can be used to unify a number of more classical MRI reconstruction constraints, but without needing to make the strong assumptions of classical constrained reconstruction methods.",

      "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/nbm.4921",
      "abstract": "Presently, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) magnets must deliver excellent magnetic field (B0) uniformity to achieve optimum image quality. Long magnets can satisfy the homogeneity requirements but require considerable superconducting material. These designs result in large, heavy, costly, and unstable systems that aggravate as field strength increases. This issue is a crucial factor in the disparity of MR density and field strength use across the globe. Low-income settings show reduced access to MRI, especially to high field strengths. This article summarizes the proposed modifications to MRI superconducting magnet design and their impact on accessibility, including compact, reduced liquid Helium and specialty systems. Reducing the amount of superconductor inevitably entails shrinking the magnet size, resulting in higher field inhomogeneity. This work also reviews the state-of-the-art imaging and reconstruction methods to overcome this issue. Finally, we summarize the current and future challenges and opportunities in the design of accessible MRI.",

      "abstract": "Transperineal ultrasound (TPUS) is a non-invasive, real-time imaging technique increasingly utilized for the evaluation of anorectal and pelvic floor disorders in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In ulcerative colitis, it enables accurate assessment of rectal wall thickness and vascularity, which correlate closely with both endoscopic and histological inflammation. This makes it a practical alternative to sigmoidoscopy, especially in settings such as pregnancy, childhood, or long-term disease monitoring. In Crohn's disease, TPUS offers high diagnostic accuracy for detecting, classifying, and monitoring perianal fistulas and abscesses. It is also effective for evaluating rectovaginal fistulas and pouch-related complications following restorative proctocolectomy. Advancements such as color Doppler imaging, contrast-enhanced ultrasound, three-dimensional reconstruction, and computer-assisted grayscale analysis further enhance its diagnostic and functional capabilities. Compared to magnetic resonance imaging and endoscopic ultrasound, TPUS serves as a practical, patient-friendly, and cost-effective frontline or complementary imaging tool for comprehensive disease evaluation and treatment planning-particularly useful in children, pregnant women, and resource-limited settings. Its bedside feasibility, repeatability, and expanding role in treatment monitoring underscore its value in modern IBD care pathways.",

Consensus was defined when ⩾70% of panellists agreed with a statement, rated using a 7-point Likert scale. We also analysed the associated annual costs for partial responders and patients in remission according to the agreed long-term definitions, based on a literature review and the experience of the scientific committee. Medication costs were excluded from the analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Sixty Spanish gastroenterologists with extensive experience in IBD management participated in the consultation. Consensus was achieved on partial response definitions with different criteria over time, including clinical scores, biomarkers and imaging or endoscopic examinations. The annual cost for partial responders and patients in remission was estimated at €2570.40 and €820.20 for UC, €1607.30 and €718.0 for luminal CD and €2886.70 and €888.80 for perianal CD, respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The concept of partial responders has been defined in four clinical scenarios.

All patients underwent low-level incision and high-level thread-drawing surgery. In the 1/5, 1/4, 1/3, and 1/2 groups, the rubber band cutting force was applied by tightening the surrounding muscle bundle to 1/5, 1/4, 1/3, and 1/2 of its circumference, respectively (using a graduated rubber band).

A risk of bias assessment was conducted using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for randomized studies and ROBINS-I for non-randomized studies, revealing that all included studies had at least a moderate risk of bias.<h4>Results</h4>Three-dimensional models improved anatomical visualization compared to 2D MRI, potentially enhancing surgical planning accuracy and reducing recurrence rates. They also offered educational benefits for surgeons and patients.

Intestinal ultrasound [IUS] is an attractive, non-invasive alternative to endoscopy, demonstrating early transmural changes after treatment initiation. Therefore, we investigated IUS and contrast-enhanced ultrasound [CEUS] to predict [early] endoscopic treatment response.<h4>Methods</h4>Consecutive patients with endoscopically active CD, starting anti-TNFα therapy, were included. Clinical, biochemical, IUS, and CEUS parameters at baseline [T0], after 4-8 weeks [T1] and 12-34 weeks [T2] were collected. The most severely inflamed segment at endoscopy (highest segmental Simplified Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease [SES-CD]) and IUS (highest segmental bowel wall thickness [BWT]) was identified. At T2, endoscopic response [decrease in SES-CD ≥ 50%] and remission [SES-CD = 0] were scored.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 40 patients were included: 14 reached endoscopic remission and 17 endoscopic response. At T1 (3.1 mm [1.9-4.2] vs 5.3 mm [3.8-6.9], p = 0.005) and T2 (2.0 mm [1.8-3.1] vs 5.1 [3.0-6.3] mm, p = 0.002) BWT was lower in patients with endoscopic remission. At T1 and T2, 18% (area under the receiver operating curve [AUROC]: 0.77; odds ratio [OR]: 10.80, p = 0.012) and 29% [AUROC: 0.833; OR: 37.50, p = 0.006] BWT decrease predicted endoscopic response, respectively. To determine endoscopic remission, BWT 3.2 mm was most accurate [AUROC: 0.94; OR: 39.42, p < 0.0001] at T2. In addition, absence of colour Doppler signal [OR: 13.76, p = 0.03] and the CEUS parameter wash-out rate [OR: 0.76, p = 0.019] improved the prediction model.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Reduction in BWT, already after 4-8 weeks of follow-up, predicted endoscopic response and remission.

The question of whether or not the timing of the initiating biologic therapy affects long-term disease progression remains unanswered. Herein, we calculated rates of change in the Lémann index-which quantifies accumulated bowel damage-as a function of the time between the disease onset and initiation of biologic therapy. We aimed to explore the impact of the earlier introduction of biologics on the rate of progression of long-term cumulative bowel damage.<h4>Methods</h4>Medical records of CD patients treated during 2009-2014 at The Mount Sinai Hospital were queried. Inclusion criteria were two comprehensive assessments allowing calculation of the index at t<sub>1</sub> and t<sub>2</sub>: two time-points ≥ 1 year apart. Patients with biologics introduced before or within 3 months at inclusion (t<sub>1</sub>) were defined as Bio-pre-t<sub>1</sub> and those who did not as Bio-post-t<sub>1</sub>. The rate of disease progression was calculated as the change in the index per year during t<sub>1</sub>-t<sub>2</sub>.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 88 patients were studied: 58 Bio-pre-t<sub>1</sub> and 30 Bio-post-t<sub>1</sub>. Among the 58 Bio-pre-t<sub>1</sub> cases, damage progressed in 29 (50%), regressed in 20 (34.5%), and stabilized in 9 (15.5%). Median time to initiation of biologics among patients whose index improved was nominally shorter compared to that in patients whose index progressed (8 vs. 15 years). Earlier introduction of biologics tended to correlate with the slower rate of progression (ρ = 0.241; p = 0.069).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Earlier introduction of biologics tended to correlate with the slower progression of bowel damage in CD, reflected by the reduced rate of Lémann index progression.",

      "abstract": "Magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) is a non-invasive, radiation-free imaging modality that facilitates the assessment of transmural Crohn's disease activity. It offers advantages over ileo-colonoscopy, which is limited to mucosal-level evaluation, cannot routinely assess small bowel segments proximal to the terminal ileum, and is unable to detect extra-luminal complications. Despite these advantages, the lack of standardised criteria for defining and appraising radiologic disease activity on MRE has contributed to variability in interpretation and clinical application. In response, multiple MRE-based scoring systems have been developed to quantify radiological Crohn's disease activity in both luminal and post-operative settings. Radiological disease activity scores specific to luminal Crohn's disease include the magnetic resonance index of activity (MaRIA), simplified MaRIA, Nancy score, London score, Crohn's disease magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) index, Clermont score, paediatric inflammatory Crohn's MRE index, MRE global score, MRE index, and modified Clermont score. The MR score and the MRI in Crohn's disease to predict postoperative recurrence index have been specifically developed to evaluate post-operative disease recurrence in Crohn's disease. Nevertheless, heterogeneity in scoring parameters, variability in computational complexity, and a lack of consensus regarding optimal score selection, have impeded widespread clinical adoption of radiological disease activity scores. This narrative review aims to summarise the key imaging features of luminal Crohn's disease, explore their integration into existing MRE scoring indices, and critically compare the structure, strengths, and clinical applicability of each. Furthermore, MRI scores specific to post-operative Crohn's disease evaluation, and the assessment of cumulative bowel wall damage using the Lemann index will also be discussed.",

      "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) frequently affects the posterior pelvic compartment, where accurate non-invasive imaging is essential for diagnosis and surgical planning. <b>Aim:</b> This systematic review evaluates the diagnostic performance of transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) in detecting posterior compartment DIE, specifically rectosigmoid lesions, uterosacral ligament involvement, and pouch of Douglas obliteration. <b>Material and Methods:</b> A comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science was performed for studies published between 2015 and 2025. Eligible studies assessed the accuracy of TVUS for posterior compartment DIE using laparoscopy and histology as reference standards. Data on sensitivity, specificity, and overall diagnostic accuracy were extracted or derived. The study's quality was evaluated using the QUADAS-2 tool. <b>Results:</b> Thirty eligible studies were included. The mean sensitivities and specificities reported in the included studies reached 83.05% and 90.53% for rectosigmoid disease, 78.07% and 90.49% for uterosacral ligament involvement, and 79.58% and 89.75% for pouch of Douglas obliteration, respectively. Adjunctive techniques such as gel sonovaginography, rectal water contrast, or saline instillation into the pouch of Douglas were described, but their use was inconsistent. Marked heterogeneity in patient preparation, scanning protocols, and reporting limited comparability across studies. Despite this, TVUS demonstrated diagnostic performance within a similar range to that reported for MRI in prior systematic reviews, with the advantages of lower cost, accessibility, and integration into routine gynecological practice. <b>Conclusions:</b> TVUS is consistently reported as a reliable and cost-effective imaging modality and, in line with international guidelines, should be considered the first-line option for posterior compartment DIE, though further standardization of scanning and reporting protocols is needed to optimize reproducibility and clinical utility.",

Imaging techniques play a crucial role in diagnosis, monitoring disease activity, and guiding therapeutic response. This review summarizes the current evidence on radiologic imaging techniques in IBD, focusing on intestinal ultrasound (IUS), computed tomography enterography (CTE), magnetic resonance enterography (MRE), and other emerging technologies.<h4>Methods</h4>A literature review was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library, encompassing publications up to 31 October 2024.<h4>Results</h4>IUS offers a non-invasive tool for assessing bowel wall thickness, vascularity, and complications. CTE and MRE provide detailed visualization of luminal and extraluminal disease, with MRE preferred for routine monitoring due to the absence of ionizing radiation. Standardized indices and scoring systems aid in objective disease activity assessment. Emerging technologies like Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/MRI and radiomics show promise in combining metabolic and morphological information for complex cases.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Imaging has a central role in IBD management, with IUS, CTE, and MRE demonstrating high diagnostic accuracy.

      "abstract": "The rising incidence of pancreatic diseases, including acute and chronic pancreatitis and various pancreatic neoplasms, poses a significant global health challenge. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) for example, has a high mortality rate due to late-stage diagnosis and its inaccessible location. Advances in imaging technologies, though improving diagnostic capabilities, still necessitate biopsy confirmation. Artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning and deep learning, has emerged as a revolutionary force in healthcare, enhancing diagnostic precision and personalizing treatment. This narrative review explores Artificial intelligence's role in pancreatic imaging, its technological advancements, clinical applications, and associated challenges. Following the PRISMA-DTA guidelines, a comprehensive search of databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library was conducted, focusing on Artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, and radiomics in pancreatic imaging. Articles involving human subjects, written in English, and published up to March 31, 2024, were included. The review process involved title and abstract screening, followed by full-text review and refinement based on relevance and novelty. Recent Artificial intelligence advancements have shown promise in detecting and diagnosing pancreatic diseases. Deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been effective in detecting and segmenting pancreatic tissues as well as differentiating between benign and malignant lesions. Deep learning algorithms have also been used to predict survival time, recurrence risk, and therapy response in pancreatic cancer patients. Radiomics approaches, extracting quantitative features from imaging modalities such as CT, MRI, and endoscopic ultrasound, have enhanced the accuracy of these deep learning models. Despite the potential of Artificial intelligence in pancreatic imaging, challenges such as legal and ethical considerations, algorithm transparency, and data security remain. This review underscores the transformative potential of Artificial intelligence in enhancing the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic diseases, ultimately aiming to improve patient outcomes and survival rates.",

      "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) contamination in agricultural soil brings severe health risks through the dietary intake of Cd-polluted crops. The comprehensive role of pectin in lowering Cd accumulation is investigated through low Cd accumulated (L) and high Cd accumulated (H) cultivars of L. sativa. The significantly different Cd contents in the edible parts of two L. sativa cultivars are accomplished by different Cd transportations. The pectin is the dominant responsive cell wall component according to significantly increased uronic acid contents and the differential Cd absorption between unmodified and modified cell wall. The chemical structure characterization revealed the decreased methyl esterification in pectin under Cd treatment compared with control. Significantly brighter LM19 relative fluorescence density and 40.82% decreased methanol in the root pectin of L cultivar under Cd treatment (p < 0.05) supported that the de-methyl esterification of root pectin is more significant in L cultivar than in H cultivar. The pectin de-methyl esterification of L cultivar is achieved by the upregulation of pectin esterases and the downregulation of pectin esterase inhibitors under Cd treatments, which has facilitated the higher Cd-binding of pectin. Our findings provide deep insight into the differential Cd accumulation of L. sativa cultivars and contribute to the understanding the pollutant behaviors in plants.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Chloride channels (CLCs) play critical roles in anion transport, stress adaptation, and ion homeostasis in plants. Whereas their genomic wide indentification and functional divergence in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) remain largely unexplored. Methods and results In this study, we identified nine CLC genes in the tomato genome, classifying them into two evolutionarily distinct clades (Group I and II) based on phylogenetic analysis. Structural dissection revealed conserved transmembrane domains (9–12 TMDs) and motif patterns (e.g., motifs 3/7/9 in Group I), with SlCLC02 exhibiting the largest gene size (27,041 bp). Promoter analysis indicated the presence of key abiotic stress-responsive cis-elements (ABRE, MYB, MYC), aligning with the pronounced transcriptional dynamics of SlCLCs under salinity stress. Notably, qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that most SlCLC genes (particularly SlCLC05, an ortholog to AtCLC-g) exhibited rapid upregulation within 1-4 hours followed by downregulation in roots under salinity treatment, suggesting early stress signaling roles. Likewise, preliminary expression profiling under cadmium stress further identified specific induction of SlCLC07, proposing gene-specific roles in heavy metal detoxification. Strikingly, SlCLC09 lacked collinearity with Arabidopsis/potato homologs, implying lineage-specific diversification. Discussion These findings elucidate the SlCLC family’s structural diversity, evolutionary constraints, and stress-responsive regulation, providing a framework for targeting specific SlCLC genes (e.g., SlCLC05) to enhance chloride homeostasis in crops under combined salinity and cadmium stress. This study will open a new research direction for genetic crop improvement to ensure protected vegetable production.",

This study is possibly the first to apply genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and selective sweep analysis to identify potential Cd stress-responsive genes in P. vaginatum. We identified a total of 89 candidate genes and 656 putative selective sweeps regions. Based on the correlation analysis of differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we identified the 55 key genes associated with metabolic changes induced by Cd treatment as the Cd tolerance-related genes.

      "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major global health concern, and the development of effective treatment strategies is crucial. Enzyme prodrug therapy (EPT) shows promise in combating tumors but faces challenges in achieving sustained expression of therapeutic enzymes and optimal biological distribution. To address these issues, a fungi-triggered in situ chemotherapeutics generator (named as SC@CS@5-FC) was constructed via oral delivery of a prodrug (5-fluorocytosine, 5-FC) for the treatment of orthotopic colorectal tumor. When SC@CS@5-FC targets the tumor through tropism by Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SC), the chemotherapeutic generator could be degraded under abundant hyaluronidase (HAase) in the tumor microenvironment by an enzyme-responsive gate to release prodrug (5-FC). And nontoxic 5-FC was catalyzed to toxic chemotherapy drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) by cytosine deaminase (CD) of SC. Meanwhile, SC and zinc-coordinated chitosan nanoparticles could be used as immune adjuvants to activate antigen-presenting cells and further enhance the therapeutic effect. Our results demonstrated that SC@CS@5-FC could effectively inhibit tumor growth and prolong mouse survival in an orthotopic colorectal cancer model.

The desirability of the outcome distribution resulting from the policy recommendation is measured through a functional capturing the distributional characteristic that the decision maker is interested in optimizing. This could be, e.g., its inherent inequality, welfare, level of poverty or its distance to a desired outcome distribution. If the functional of interest is not quasi-convex or if there are constraints, the optimal recommendation may be a mixture of treatments. This vastly expands the set of recommendations that must be considered. We characterize the difficulty of the problem by obtaining maximal expected regret lower bounds. Furthermore, we propose two (near) regret-optimal policies. The first policy is static and thus applicable irrespectively of subjects arriving sequentially or not in the course of the experimentation phase. The second policy can utilize that subjects arrive sequentially by successively eliminating inferior treatments and thus spends the sampling effort where it is most needed.",

      "doi": "",
      "abstract": "Matching is a widely used causal inference design that aims to approximate a randomized experiment using observational data by forming matched sets of treated and control units based on similarities in their covariates. Ideally, treated units are exactly matched with controls on these covariates, enabling randomization-based inference for treatment effects as in a randomized experiment, under the assumption of no unobserved covariates. However, inexact matching often occurs, leading to residual covariate imbalance after matching. Previous matched studies have typically overlooked this issue and relied on conventional randomization-based inference, assuming that some covariate balance criteria are met. Recent research, however, has shown that this approach can introduce significant bias and proposed methods to correct for bias arising from inexact matching in randomization-based inference. These methods, however, are primarily focused on the constant treatment effect and its extensions (i.e., Fisher's sharp null) and do not apply to average treatment effects (i.e., Neyman's weak null). To address this gap, we introduce a new method -- inverse post-matching probability weighting -- for conducting randomization-based inference for average treatment effects under inexact matching. Our theoretical and simulation results indicate that, compared to conventional randomization-based inference methods, our approach significantly reduces bias and improves coverage rates in the presence of inexact matching. Additionally, we demonstrate how this method can be extended to the instrumental variable setting to simultaneously correct for bias due to inexact matching on observed covariates and bias due to unobserved covariates.",

      "abstract": "In health-related experiments, treatment effects can be identified using paired data that consist of pre- and post-treatment measurements. In this framework, sequential testing strategies are widely accepted statistical tools in practice. Since performances of parametric sequential testing procedures vitally depend on the validity of the parametric assumptions regarding underlying data distributions, we focus on distribution-free mechanisms for sequentially evaluating treatment effects. In fixed sample size designs, the density-based empirical likelihood (DBEL) methods provide powerful nonparametric approximations to optimal Neyman-Pearson type statistics. In this article, we extend the DBEL methodology to develop a novel sequential DBEL testing procedure for detecting treatment effects based on paired data. The asymptotic consistency of the proposed test is shown. An extensive Monte Carlo study confirms that the proposed test outperforms the conventional sequential Wilcoxon signed-rank test across a variety of alternatives. The excellent applicability of the proposed method is exemplified using the ventilator-associated pneumonia study that evaluates the effect of Chlorhexidine Gluconate treatment in reducing oral colonization by pathogens in ventilated patients.",

However, learning the impact of a treatment on a continuous temporal response, when the covariates suffer extensively from measurement error and even the timing of the treatments is uncertain, has not been addressed. We introduce a novel data-driven method that can estimate treatment-response trajectories in this challenging scenario. We model personalized treatment-response curves as a combination of parametric response functions, hierarchically sharing information across individuals, and a sparse Gaussian process for the baseline trend. Importantly, our model considers measurement error not only in treatment covariates, but also in treatment times, a problem which arises in practice for example when treatment information is based on self-reporting. In a challenging and timely problem of estimating the impact of diet on continuous blood glucose measurements, our model leads to significant improvements in estimation accuracy and prediction.",

      "abstract": "Randomized experiments have been used to assist decision-making in many areas. They help people select the optimal treatment for the test population with certain statistical guarantee. However, subjects can show significant heterogeneity in response to treatments. The problem of customizing treatment assignment based on subject characteristics is known as uplift modeling, differential response analysis, or personalized treatment learning in literature. A key feature for uplift modeling is that the data is unlabeled. It is impossible to know whether the chosen treatment is optimal for an individual subject because response under alternative treatments is unobserved. This presents a challenge to both the training and the evaluation of uplift models. In this paper we describe how to obtain an unbiased estimate of the key performance metric of an uplift model, the expected response. We present a new uplift algorithm which creates a forest of randomized trees. The trees are built with a splitting criterion designed to directly optimize their uplift performance based on the proposed evaluation method. Both the evaluation method and the algorithm apply to arbitrary number of treatments and general response types. Experimental results on synthetic data and industry-provided data show that our algorithm leads to significant performance improvement over other applicable methods.",

      "abstract": "Dynamic treatment regimens (DTRs), also known as treatment algorithms or adaptive interventions, play an increasingly important role in many health domains. DTRs are motivated to address the unique and changing needs of individuals by delivering the type of treatment needed, when needed, while minimizing unnecessary treatment. Practically, a DTR is a sequence of decision rules that specify, for each of several points in time, how available information about the individual's status and progress should be used in practice to decide which treatment (e.g., type or intensity) to deliver. The sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) is an experimental design widely used to empirically inform the development of DTRs. Sample size planning resources for SMARTs have been developed for continuous, binary, and survival outcomes. However, an important gap exists in sample size estimation methodology for SMARTs with longitudinal count outcomes. Further, in many health domains, count data are overdispersed - having variance greater than their mean. We propose a Monte Carlo-based approach to sample size estimation applicable to many types of longitudinal outcomes and provide a case study with longitudinal overdispersed count outcomes.

To our best knowledge, there is no established model averaging approach for distributed data with a focus on improving the estimation of treatment effects. Specifically, under distributed data networks, our framework provides an interpretable tree-based ensemble of CATE estimators that joins models across study sites, while actively modeling the heterogeneity in data sources through site partitioning.

Existing approaches for treatment effect estimation primarily rely on Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs), which tend to feature more homogeneous patient groups, making them less relevant for uncovering subgroups in the population encountered in real-world clinical practice. Subgroup analyses established for RCTs suffer from significant statistical biases when applied to observational studies, which benefit from larger and more representative populations. Our work introduces a novel, outcome-guided, subgroup analysis strategy for identifying subgroups of treatment response in both RCTs and observational studies alike. It hence positions itself in-between individualised and average treatment effect estimation to uncover patient subgroups with distinct treatment responses, critical for actionable insights that may influence treatment guidelines. In experiments, our approach significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art method for subgroup analysis in both randomised and observational treatment regimes.",

Therefore, both imaging modalities are emerging as pivotal diagnostic tools to achieve the emerging therapeutic target of transmural healing associated with better disease outcomes. Despite its numerous potential advantages over endoscopy and even MRE and its good availability, IUS is still widely underused to monitor and manage inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients and help in making clinical decisions in routine practice. This situation is clearly due to the absence of validated, reliable, and responsive indices, as well as the lack of trained gastroenterologists and radiologists, as IUS is a component of radiologist expertise in several countries but not yet integrated into the training program of gastroenterologists. However, there is an increasing body of evidence in the literature that IUS and MRE are both becoming essential imaging resources to help clinicians in making reliable decisions. Here, we discuss the up-to-date evidence about the usefulness and performance of cross-sectional imaging, focusing on the ability of bowel US and MRE to aid clinical decision-making for the optimal management and monitoring of IBD.",

A systematic literature search was performed consulting the following databases: Pubmed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Sport Discus, Clinical Trials, and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. The applied search terms were upper limb, activity tracking, and functional activity. Studies were included when they reported the accuracy and/or validity results of accelerometer-based methods to describe upper limb functional use. 13 studies were included describing counts threshold analyzing methods, gross movement scores and machine learning models. Seven studies retrieved a medium score, and six received a low-quality score on the quality assessment scale. The classification accuracy of the machine learning models ranged from 68 % to 97 % for intrasubject accuracy and from 59 % to 92 % for intersubject accuracy, compared to video annotated data. Besides good accuracy scores, the machine learning models also retrieved high validity results. High accuracy results were furthermore retrieved for the counts threshold method. Based on the evaluated studies, objectively assessing upper limb functional use can be done accurately and valid using accelerometry and can be an added value to assess upper limb dysfunctions in daily clinical practice.",

We analysed the COVISHIELD™ COVID-19 vaccine; falsified versions of which were found in India, Myanmar and Uganda. We demonstrate for the first time that analysis of spectra from the vaccine vial label and its adhesive could be used as a novel approach to detect falsified vaccines. Vials tested by this approach could be retained in the supply chain since it is non-invasive. We also assessed whether MALDI-ToF MS could be used to distinguish the COVISHIELD™ vaccine from surrogates of falsified vaccines and the effect of temperature on vaccine stability. Both polysorbate 80 and L-histidine excipients of the genuine vaccine could be detected by the presence of a unique combination of MALDI-ToF MS peaks which allowed us to distinguish between the genuine vaccines and falsified vaccine surrogates. Furthermore, even if a falsified product contained polysorbate 80 at the same concentration as used in the genuine vaccine, the characteristic spectral profile of polysorbate 80 used in genuine products is a reliable internal marker for vaccine authenticity. Our findings demonstrate that MALDI-ToF MS analysis of extracts from vial labels and the vaccine excipients themselves can be used independently to detect falsified vaccines. This approach has the potential to be integrated into the national regulatory standards and WHO's Prevent, Detect, and Respond strategy as a novel effective tool for detecting falsified vaccines.",

The diagnosis of IBD is based on clinical symptoms combined with results found in endoscopic and radiological examinations. In addition, the discovery of biomarkers has significantly improved the diagnosis and management of IBD. Several potential genetic, serological, fecal, microbial, histological and immunological biomarkers have been proposed for IBD, and they have been evaluated for clinical routine and clinical trials. Ileocolonoscopy, especially with biopsy collection, has been considered the standard method to diagnose IBD and to assess clinical activity of the disease, but it is limited to the colon and terminal ileum and is considered invasive. For this reason, non-invasive biomarkers are necessary for this type of chronic inflammatory disease, which affects mostly young individuals, as they are expected to have a long follow-up.",

Most discussions of reliability problems in science focus on systematic biases. We broaden the lens to emphasize the idiosyncrasy of conscious and unconscious decisions that researchers make during data analysis. We coordinated 161 researchers in 73 research teams and observed their research decisions as they used the same data to independently test the same prominent social science hypothesis: that greater immigration reduces support for social policies among the public. In this typical case of social science research, research teams reported both widely diverging numerical findings and substantive conclusions despite identical start conditions. Researchers' expertise, prior beliefs, and expectations barely predict the wide variation in research outcomes. More than 95% of the total variance in numerical results remains unexplained even after qualitative coding of all identifiable decisions in each team's workflow. This reveals a universe of uncertainty that remains hidden when considering a single study in isolation. The idiosyncratic nature of how researchers' results and conclusions varied is a previously underappreciated explanation for why many scientific hypotheses remain contested. These results call for greater epistemic humility and clarity in reporting scientific findings.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Context</h4>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) diagnosed in early pregnancy is a health care challenge because it increases the risk of adverse outcomes. Plasma-glycated CD59 (pGCD59) is an emerging biomarker for diabetes and GDM. The aim of this study was to assess the performance of pGCD59 as a biomarker of early GDM and its association with delivering a large for gestational age (LGA) infant.<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess the performance of pGCD59 to identify women with GDM in early pregnancy (GDM < 20) and assess the association of pGCD59 with LGA and potentially others adverse neonatal outcomes linked to GDM.<h4>Methods</h4>Blood levels of pGCD59 were measured in samples from 693 obese women (body mass index > 29) undergoing a 75-g, 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at <20 weeks' gestation in the Vitamin D and Lifestyle Intervention study: the main analyses included 486 subjects who had normal glucose tolerance throughout the pregnancy, 207 who met criteria for GDM at <20 weeks, and 77 diagnosed with GDM at pregnancy weeks 24 through 28. Reference tests were 75-g, 2-hour OGTT adjudicated based on International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group criteria. The index test was a pGCD59 ELISA.<h4>Results</h4>Mean pGCD59 levels were significantly higher (P < 0.001) in women with GDM < 20 (3.9 ± 1.1 standard peptide units [SPU]) than in those without (2.7 ± 0.7 SPU). pGCD59 accurately identified GDM in early pregnancy with an area under the curve receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83-0.90). One-unit increase in maternal pGCD59 level was associated with 36% increased odds of delivering an LGA infant (odds ratio for LGA vs non-LGA infant: 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.8; P = 0.016).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our results indicate that pGCD59 is a simple and accurate biomarker for detection of GDM in early pregnancy and risk assessment of LGA.",

Standard radiology reports are written for clinicians using technical language often inaccessible to patients, which can cause anxiety and hinder engagement. This study evaluates the feasibility and safety of AI-generated patient-friendly MRI fistula summaries to improve patient understanding and shared decision-making. MRI fistula reports spanning healed to complex disease were identified and used to generate AI patient-friendly summaries via ChatGPT-4. Six de-identified MRI reports and corresponding AI summaries were assessed by clinicians for hallucinations and readability (Flesch-Kincaid score). Sixteen patients with perianal fistulas were randomized to review either AI summaries or original reports and rated them on readability, comprehensibility, utility, quality, follow-up questions, and trustworthiness using Likert scales. Patients rated AI summaries significantly higher in readability (median 5 vs. 2, p = 0.011), comprehensibility (5 vs. 2, p = 0.007), utility (5 vs. 3, p = 0.014), and overall quality (4.5 vs. 4, p = 0.013), with fewer follow-up questions (3 vs. 4, p = 0.018). Clinicians found AI summaries more readable (mean Flesch-Kincaid 54.6 vs. 32.2, p = 0.005) and free of hallucinations. No clinically significant inaccuracies were identified. AI-generated patient-friendly MRI summaries have potential to enhance patient communication and clinical workflow in pfCD. Larger studies are needed to validate clinical utility, hallucination rates, and acceptability.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Rectourethral fistula represents a rare but devastating complication following prostate cancer treatment, with radiation-induced fistulas presenting particular challenges due to compromised tissue vascularity and healing capacity. While various surgical approaches have been described, management of complex post-brachytherapy rectoprostatic fistulas remains challenging with limited reports of successful robotic-assisted techniques. This case report presents a novel robotic-assisted surgical approach incorporating technical modifications including rectal rotation with mesorectal interposition, which has not been widely documented in the literature for managing radiation-induced rectoprostatic fistulas.<h4>Case presentation</h4>A 54-year-old male with localized prostate cancer (clinical stage T2N0M0, Gleason score 3 + 3) developed fecaluria, pneumaturia, and severe pelvic pain one year after brachytherapy treatment. Diagnostic imaging revealed a 1.6 cm anterior rectal wall defect with a fluid-filled cavity between the rectum and prostate. Following initial palliative sigmoidostomy for symptom relief, definitive repair was performed 13 months later using robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy with segmental rectal resection and coloanal anastomosis. Key technical innovations included bladder stabilization with externalized sutures and 180° rectal rotation, positioning the posterior mesorectum as a natural barrier against fistula recurrence. The procedure duration was 365 min with 200 mL blood loss and no immediate complications. At 24-month follow-up, the patient demonstrated complete fistula resolution with normal bowel function (Wexner continence score: 3) following stoma reversal. Prostate-specific antigen remained undetectable with no evidence of cancer recurrence. The patient reported significant quality-of-life improvement, resuming pre-illness physical activities including walking 7-10 km daily.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This case demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of robotic-assisted surgical management for complex radiation-induced rectoprostatic fistulas. The novel technique of rectal rotation with mesorectal interposition may provide additional protection against recurrent fistula formation compared to conventional approaches. This innovative robotic approach could be considered in selected patients with extensive radiation-induced tissue damage where traditional repair techniques may be insufficient, potentially offering improved outcomes in this challenging clinical scenario.",

This study reported long-term outcomes from a referral colorectal center, focusing on the use of the Martius flap for managing low- and mid-complex RVFs.<h4>Methods</h4>This study included eligible patients who underwent Martius flap repair at Shahid Faghihi Hospital (Shiraz, Iran), between 2013 and 2023. Continence status and sexual function were assessed using the Cleveland Clinic Incontinence Score (CCIS) and the female sexual function index (FSFI) score. Fistula recurrence was defined as the postoperative passage of gas, feces, or mucosal discharge from the vagina. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software. Within-group comparisons were conducted using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, and between-group analyses were performed using independent samples <i>t</i> tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, and Fisher's exact tests. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 27 cases, 37% were classified as low RVF and 63% as mid RVF. Recurrent RVF was observed in 63% of patients, with a median of 2.00 previous fistula surgeries (interquartile range [IQR]=1.50-4.50). After a median follow-up of 48 months (IQR=24.00-84.00), the total success rate was 88.9%. The CCIS significantly decreased postoperatively compared to preoperative levels (P=0.003). Postoperative FSFI scores were within an acceptable range (22.2±4.22).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The Martius flap procedure was safe, with low morbidity and favorable functional and cosmetic outcomes. It could be considered a first-line treatment option for low- and mid-complex RVFs.",

Case record review was performed on 103 patients with pCD who underwent proctectomy at St Mark's Hospital, Harrow and the Western General Hospital, Edinburgh between 2005 and 2017. Healing rates at 6 and 12 months post-proctectomy were considered; univariate analysis was performed. Sixty out of 103 patients (58.3%) had failure of wound healing at 6 months and 41/103 (39.8%) at 12 months. In total, 63.1% (65/103) patients received biologic therapies prior to proctectomy; however, exposure to biologics was not a significant factor in predicting failure of wound healing at 12 months (infliximab p = 0.255; adalimumab p = 0.889; vedolizumab p = 0.153). Male gender was the only variable associated with poor wound healing at 12 months on univariate analysis (p = 0.017). A lower pre-operative C-reactive protein was associated with early wound healing at 6 months compared with at 12 months (p = 0.041) on univariate analysis. Other parameters not associated with rates of wound healing included smoking status, corticosteroid exposure, thiopurine exposure, number of previous biologics, perianal sepsis on MRI within the last 12 months, duration of CD prior to proctectomy and pre-operative albumin.

      "abstract": "Dear Editor, We read with interest the study by Abramowitz et al. [1] on the comparison of different methods of fistula closure in patients with fistulating perianal Crohn's disease. This is an area of particular interest as there is no reliable method of surgical closure in this patient group [2]. The study spanned several years and had an intensive followup period involving specialist clinics and MRI scans. Although no significant difference could be found between the two study groups, we feel that the conclusion cannot be justified by the methodology. The major issue we identified with this study was the use of only adalimumab as an antitumour necrosis factor (TNF) agent. This meant that patients treated with infliximab, the most common antiTNF α agent used in fistulating perianal Crohn's disease [3], were excluded from the study. This resulted in a lack of patients eligible for analysis and thus left the study significantly underpowered with a sample size approximately 75% less than their target. We feel that it would have been a better reflection of the study had the title included ‘adalimumab’ as opposed to ‘antiTNF’. Furthermore, whilst the authors acknowledge the lack of patient numbers in the discussion they do not include this in the abstract, only stating that ‘the results should be interpreted with caution’. Given that the study did not recruit anywhere near an appropriate number of patients to produce statistically comparable data, it would be appropriate to highlight this in the abstract. The most useful finding was that, irrespective of other surgical treatment, seton removal with adalimumab resulted in a fistula healing rate of 60% and recurrent perianal abscess rate of 20%. These are helpful figures to support patients deciding on whether to keep their setons or have them removed.",

      "abstract": "Simple Summary Cancer arising at the site of a chronic perianal fistula is rare in patients with Crohn’s disease. The relationship between perianal fistula in CD (Chron’s disease) and SCC (squamous cell carcinoma) development is not clear but chronic inflammation of ano-rectal mucosa, delayed wound healing and cell turnover may play important roles. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the clinical characteristics of patients with squamous cell carcinoma arising from perianal fistula in CD, the surgery and oncological treatment, the role of HPV infection, immunosuppression and the survival of these patients. Fistula-related carcinoma in CD can be very difficult to diagnose. An early diagnosis has the potential to improve the outcome of disease. Abstract Perianal fistulizing Crohn’s disease is a very disabling condition with poor quality of life. Patients with perianal fistulizing Crohn’s disease are also at risk of perianal fistula-related squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Cancer arising at the site of a chronic perianal fistula is rare in patients with Crohn’s disease and there is a paucity of data regarding its incidence, diagnosis and management. A systematic review of the literature was undertaken using Medline, Embase, Pubmed, Cochrane and Web of Science. Several small series have described sporadic cases with perianal cancer in Crohn’s disease. The incidence rate of SCC related to perianal fistula was very low (<1%). Prognosis was poor. Colorectal disease, chronic perianal disease and HPV infection were possible risk factors. Fistula-related carcinoma in CD (Chron’s disease) can be very difficult to diagnose. Examination may be limited by pain, strictures and induration of the perianal tissues. HPV is an important risk factor with a particular carcinogenesis mechanism. MRI can help clinicians in diagnosis. Examination under anesthesia is highly recommended when findings, a change in symptoms, or simply long-standing disease in the perineum are present. Future studies are needed to understand the role of HPV vaccination in preventing fistula-related cancer.",

In this study, we aimed to conduct a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MSC therapy for perianal CD (pCD).\n\n\nMETHODS\nRCTs reporting MSC therapy for perianal fistulas in CD were searched and included. The effectiveness and safety data were analyzed using RevMan 5.3.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 7 RCTs were included in this meta-analysis. The analysis showed that patients receiving MSC therapy presented a higher healing rate (HR) of pCD than those in the control group (odds ratio (OR)=1.42; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18, 1.71; P=0.0002). Compared with placebo (saline solution), MSC therapy improved the HR of pCD (OR=1.85; 95% CI 1.32, 2.60; P=0.0004). MSC therapy showed significant long-term efficacy (OR=1.36; P=0.009; 95% CI 1.08, 1.71). When MRI was used to evaluate fistula healing, a pooled analysis showed that the MSC group achieved a higher HR than the control group (OR=1.95; 95% CI 1.33, 2.87; P=0.0007). Allogeneic MSC therapy was superior to the control treatment in improving HR (OR = 1.97; 95% CI 1.40, 2.75; P<0.001). Furthermore, no significant differences were observed between MSC therapy and placebo in terms of adverse events (AEs) (OR = 1.16; 95% CI 0.76, 1.76; P = 0.48). None of the AEs were judged to be related to MSC treatment.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis meta-analysis of RCTs provided evidence that local MSC injection is safe and efficacious for perianal fistulas in CD. In addition, this treatment has favorable long-term efficacy and safety profiles.",

      "abstract": "The image acquisition parameters (IAPs) used to create MRI scans are central to defining the appearance of the images. Deep learning models trained on data acquired using certain parameters might not generalize well to images acquired with different parameters. Being able to recover such parameters directly from an image could help determine whether a deep learning model is applicable, and could assist with data harmonization and/or domain adaptation. Here, we introduce a neural network model that can predict many complex IAPs used to generate an MR image with high accuracy solely using the image, with a single forward pass. These predicted parameters include field strength, echo and repetition times, acquisition matrix, scanner model, scan options, and others. Even challenging parameters such as contrast agent type can be predicted with good accuracy. We perform a variety of experiments and analyses of our model's ability to predict IAPs on many MRI scans of new patients, and demonstrate its usage in a realistic application. Predicting IAPs from the images is an important step toward better understanding the relationship between image appearance and IAPs. This in turn will advance the understanding of many concepts related to the generalizability of neural network models on medical images, including domain shift, domain adaptation, and data harmonization.",

A systematic search was conducted on MEDLINE and Scopus for RCTs published from 1 January 2000 to 31 January 2023. Eligible studies included full-text articles with at least 50 adult CD patients. Primary and secondary outcomes, along with their measurement instruments, were categorized according to the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Filter 2.1 framework. From 88 included studies, 393 outcomes were analyzed. Clinical outcomes, such as clinical remission and response, were the most prevalent (50.6%); biomarkers (11.5%) and patient-reported outcomes (10.2%) were also assessed. Other outcomes included disease behavior and complications (2%), endoscopy (10.4%), histology (0.5%), radiology (1.3%), healthcare utilization (3.8%), and therapy-related safety (6.9%). Composite outcomes showed an increasing trend, reflecting a shift toward comprehensive evaluations. Coprimary endpoints, including clinical symptoms and mucosal inflammation, were reported in 21 of 88 studies. This review highlights the evolving landscape of outcome assessment in CD RCTs, emphasizing the increasing complexity of outcomes.

New IUS indices have been developed with ever better methodologies and are at various stage of validation. A standardized over-the-wire technique for colonic US using a flexible overtube enables endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided tissue sampling beyond the rectum, and forward-viewing radial-array echoendoscopes can assist identification of early neoplastic lesions in proximal colon. Intraoperative ultrasound and contrast-enhanced ultrasound carry an additional diagnostic value compared to conventional preoperative imaging modalities in detecting colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRLM).<h4>Summary</h4>The feasibility of IUS in monitoring IBD activity is supported by growing evidence, but uniform IUS indices are still lacking. Recent advancements in EUS are expanding capabilities for determining depth of invasion of colorectal neoplasms, tissue sampling, and EUS-guided interventions to the entire colon.

      "abstract": "Accurate identification of anal fistulas is essential, as it directly impacts the severity of subsequent perianal infections, prognostic indicators, and overall treatment outcomes. Traditional manual recognition methods are inefficient. In response, computer vision methods have been adopted to improve efficiency. Convolutional neural networks(CNNs) are the main basis for detecting anal fistulas in current computer vision techniques. However, these methods often struggle to capture long-range dependencies effectively, which results in inadequate handling of images of anal fistulas. This study proposes a new fusion model, CVT-HNet, that integrates MobileNet with vision transformer technology. This design utilizes CNNs to extract local features and Transformers to capture long-range dependencies. In addition, the MobileNetV2 with Coordinate Attention mechanism and encoder modules are optimized to improve the precision of detecting anal fistulas. Comparative experimental results show that CVT-HNet achieves an accuracy of 80.66% with significant robustness. It surpasses both pure Transformer architecture models and other fusion networks. Internal validation results demonstrate the reliability and consistency of CVT-HNet. External validation demonstrates that our model exhibits commendable transportability and generalizability. In visualization analysis, CVT-HNet exhibits a more concentrated focus on the region of interest in images of anal fistulas. Furthermore, the contribution of each CVT-HNet component module is evaluated by ablation experiments. The experimental results highlight the superior performance and practicality of CVT-HNet in detecting anal fistulas. By combining local and global information, CVT-HNet demonstrates strong performance. The model not only achieves high accuracy and robustness but also exhibits strong generalizability. This makes it suitable for real-world applications where variability in data is common.These findings emphasize its effectiveness in clinical contexts.",

      "abstract": "A case-based survey was conducted to identify practice patterns and knowledge gaps in the management of Crohn's perianal fistulas (CPF) and to further understand approaches to CPF management within the USA by healthcare professionals (HCPs) from different specialties. The web-based survey, comprising two hypothetical patient case vignettes (case 1: initial CPF presentation and progression to partial response; case 2: recurrent CPF), was distributed September-October 2020 to US gastroenterologists (GEs) and colorectal surgeons (CRSs), and nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs) from these specialties, who managed ≥1 patient with CPF/month. The survey included questions on clinician evaluation and treatment approach. Across surveyed HCPs (127 GEs, 63 GE NP/PAs, 78 CRSs and 14 CRS NP/PAs), 39% stated that they did not use any standard system for classifying/scoring CPF. On initial CPF presentation, ≥98% of HCPs reported a requirement for additional diagnostic/imaging evaluation before proceeding with medical management; GEs preferred pelvic MRI (70%) and CRSs preferred examination under anaesthesia (62%). Preferred management after partial response to initial treatment varied by HCP type (23% GEs vs 71% CRSs preferred continuation of current medical therapy; 60% vs 38% preferred seton continuation; 24% vs 41% preferred seton removal, respectively). For recurrent CPF, most HCPs chose to switch from infliximab to another antitumour necrosis factor agent, while most GEs opted to switch to a different monoclonal antibody. In contrast, 44% of GEs and 27% of CRSs opted to proceed with surgery. Lack of consensus in CPF management requires improved coordination in treatment approaches among specialists.",

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of the Janus kinase 1 preferential inhibitor, filgotinib, for the treatment of PFCD. This phase 2, double-blind, multicentre trial enrolled adults with PFCD and prior treatment failure. Participants were randomised [2:2:1] to receive filgotinib 200 mg, filgotinib 100 mg, or placebo, once daily orally for up to 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was combined fistula response (reduction from baseline of at least one draining external opening determined by physical assessment, and no fluid collections >1 cm on pelvic magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) at Week 24. Between April 2017 and July 2020, 106 individuals were screened and 57 were randomised. Discontinuations were lowest in the filgotinib 200 mg group (3/17 [17.6%] versus 13/25 [52.0%] for filgotinib 100 mg and 9/15 [60.0%] for placebo). The proportion of participants who achieved a combined fistula response at Week 24 was 47.1% (8/17; 90% confidence interval [CI] 26.0, 68.9%) in the filgotinib 200 mg group, 29.2% [7/24; 90% CI 14.6, 47.9%] in the filgotinib 100 mg group, and 25.0% [3/12; 90% CI 7.2, 52.7%] in the placebo group. Serious adverse events occurred more frequently with filgotinib 200 mg (5/17 [29.4%]) than with placebo (1/15 [6.7%]). There were no treatment-related serious adverse events or deaths. Filgotinib 200 mg was associated with numerical reductions in the number of draining perianal fistulas based on combined clinical and MRI findings compared with placebo, and was generally well tolerated [NCT03077412].",

Secondary endpoints were to assess symptomatic efficacy, adverse effects and factors associated with complete combined clinical-radiological response (deep remission). After marketing the product in France, all first patients treated consecutively were included. A complete clinical response was defined by a complete closure of all external openings with no discharge on pressure. A complete radiological response (MRI), evaluated at least after six months of follow-up, was defined by a completely fibrotic sequela without abscess. A deep remission was defined as the association of a complete clinical response with a complete radiological response. A total of 43 patients were included (M/F: 22/21, median age 37 [26-45] years). The fistulas were already drained with seton(s) and were on biologic treatment. After a median follow-up of 383 (359-505) days, 28 (65%) patients showed a clinical response (22 complete and 6 partial) and 16 (37%) achieved a deep remission. The Perineal Disease Activity Index decreased significantly after treatment: 39 (91%) patients reported symptomatic improvement in terms of discharge, pain, and induration, and 28 (65%) no longer had any perineal symptoms. No severe adverse events were reported. A short history of Crohn's disease <3 years was significantly associated with deep remission (OD 4.5 [1.0-19.1], p = 0.04). Darvadstrocel injection resulted in a clinical response for two thirds of patients and deep remission for one third. A shorter duration of Crohn's disease was associated with deep remission.",

A phase IB/IIA randomized control trial was performed in a 3:1, single-blinded study. Patients included were adult women with an anovaginal/rectovaginal fistula in the setting of Crohn disease. Seventy-five million mesenchymal stem cells were administered with a 22G needle after curettage and primary closure of the fistula tract at day 0 and month 3. Adverse and serious adverse events were recorded at post-procedure day 1, week 2, week 6, month 3, month 6, and month 12, along with clinical healing, magnetic resonance imaging, and patient-reported outcomes. A total of 19 patients were enrolled and treated-15 treatment and 4 control. There were no adverse or serious adverse events related to mesenchymal stem cell therapy.

MSCs were derived from the umbilical cords and their exosomes were isolated. Five patients with refractory perianal Crohn's disease fistulas with a median age of 35 years (range 31-47 years) were enrolled in the study. Exosome injections were administered in the operating room to patients with refractory fistula (fistulas that are irresponsive to anti-tumor necrosis factor-α administration within 6 months). Six months later, a physical examination, face-to-face interviews, and magnetic resonance imaging were employed to evaluate the therapy responses of patients. The outcomes within 6 months after initiation of therapy showed that four patients had responded to therapy. Three patients who received exosome injections exhibited complete healing, while one reported no improvement and active discharge from the fistula site. In addition, five patients (100%) reported neither systemic nor local adverse effects. Injection of exosomes extracted from MSCs demonstrates safety and a satisfactory therapeutic effect, as evidenced in this and other studies, and may play a significant role in the future treatment of gastrointestinal fistulas.",

Although it can present with a number of complications, perianal fistulae are among the most common consequences in patients with CD. In very rare cases, these patients can develop fistula-associated anal adenocarcinoma (FAAA). In this case report, we discuss a 72-year-old man with a long-term history of CD complicated by perianal fistulae, which failed medical and surgical management, ultimately presenting with acute anal pain in the outpatient setting. The physical examination revealed a seton traversing through a fistula surrounded by circumferential granulation tissue suspicious for malignancy. A biopsy of the tissue confirmed grade 3 mucinous-type infiltrating adenocarcinoma of the perianal skin. The patient was diagnosed with an anal verge malignancy associated with a fistula in the context of long-standing CD, and MRI staging demonstrated a T3N1 lesion with potential left inguinal node involvement. He completed neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy using capecitabine for five weeks with minimal tumor response, and subsequently, an abdominoperineal resection (APR) was performed with patient discharge on the fifth post-procedure day. Post-operative chemotherapy with oxaliplatin/leucovorin/fluorouracil was administered with minimal complications. Although rare, this report demonstrates the importance of consistent follow-up and mitigation of risk factors in patients with CD, along with the significance of prompt multimodal treatment in the event of developing FAAA.",

      "abstract": "Effective and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can be critical for early treatment and thus has attracted more and more attention nowadays. Since first introduced, machine learning methods have been gaining increasing popularity for AD related research. Among the various identified biomarkers, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are widely used for the prediction of AD or MCI. However, before a machine learning algorithm can be applied, image features need to be extracted to represent the MRI images. While good representations can be pivotal to the classification performance, almost all the previous studies typically rely on human labelling to find the regions of interest (ROI) which may be correlated to AD, such as hippocampus, amygdala, precuneus, etc. This procedure requires domain knowledge and is costly and tedious.   Instead of relying on extraction of ROI features, it is more promising to remove manual ROI labelling from the pipeline and directly work on the raw MRI images. In other words, we can let the machine learning methods to figure out these informative and discriminative image structures for AD classification. In this work, we propose to learn deep convolutional image features using unsupervised and supervised learning. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool in the machine learning community and has been successfully applied to various tasks. We thus propose to exploit deep features of MRI images based on a pre-trained large convolutional neural network (CNN) for AD and MCI classification, which spares the effort of manual ROI annotation process.",

The pathogenesis of PFCD involves increased production of inflammatory cytokines by infiltrating macrophages and lymphocytes, stimulation of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, activation of myofibroblasts, and elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinases. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent stromal cells with self-renewal and differentiation capabilities. Evidence from animal models and clinical trials indicates that MSC injection into PFCD lesions suppresses the infiltration of inflammatory cells and cytokines, resulting in complete fistula healing. More recently, MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) have shown promising results in promoting fistula healing, particularly in cases of refractory or relapsing fistulas. Notably, the activation of macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) in MSCs has been shown to accelerate the healing process. This narrative review discusses the mechanisms underlying PFCD pathogenesis, the therapeutic roles of MSCs and their EVs, and the potential role of autophagy upregulation in enhancing MSC function and EV production.",

      "abstract": "Perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease (PFCD) is a common presentation of CD, which affects the patients' quality of life, including social and sexual function. The management of PFCD remains a critical challenge in inflammatory bowel disease, primarily due to limited understanding of the mechanisms involved in its pathogenesis, complicating medical treatment. Increased production of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-13 by infiltrating macrophages and other inflammatory cells stimulate the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, resulting in activation of myofibroblasts and elevation of matrix metalloproteinases, leading to fistula formation. Given the potential for malignant transformation, PFCD screening is critical. Cytokine and inflammation-targeted therapies can help control this disease, but recurrence is a common complication. Surgical interventions such as fistulotomy represent viable therapeutic options, with magnetic resonance imaging serving as an important diagnostic tool for delineating fistula tract anatomy. Animal models and clinical trials demonstrate that injection of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into the fistula results in suppression of the inflammatory cells and cytokines and complete resolution of PFCD. Recently, MSC-derived extracellular vesicles were found to stimulate fistula healing, with encouraging results. In this article, we comment on the review article by Pacheco <i>et al</i>, summarizing the various lines of PFCD treatment and highlighting the role of screening for this disease. Importantly, we focus on the various mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of PFCD, the therapeutic roles of MSCs and related extracellular vesicles, and explore the potential role of autophagy in enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of these cells, which may help in the treatment of this disease.",

We evaluate three widely used segmentation models (SAM, SAM2, MedSAM) across eleven MSK MRI datasets spanning the knee, hip, spine, shoulder, and thigh. Our framework assesses both zero-shot and finetuned performance, with attention to segmentation accuracy, generalizability across imaging protocols, and reliability of derived quantitative biomarkers. Finetuned models showed consistent agreement with expert measurements for biomarkers including cartilage thickness, disc height, muscle volume, and compositional T1rho/T2 values. Automated prompting through the AutoLabel system enabled scalable segmentation, with moderate trade-offs in accuracy. As proof of concept, we applied the validated system to (i) a three-stage knee MRI triage cascade and (ii) a longitudinal landmark model that predicts total knee replacement and incident osteoarthritis. The framework offers a transparent method for benchmarking segmentation tools and connecting model performance to clinical imaging priorities.",

      "abstract": "Tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) represents a pathological connection between the trachea and esophagus, classified into congenital and acquired categories. Congenital TEF arises from embryological malformations, often coexisting with esophageal atresia (EA), while acquired TEF primarily stems from malignancies, radiotherapy, or trauma. This condition disrupts normal anatomical functions, leading to significant clinical issues, such as aspiration, respiratory infections, and malnutrition. The current review consolidates findings on the etiology, classification, and pathological mechanisms of TEF, emphasizing how genetic, developmental, and external factors shape its occurrence and progression. Diagnostic advancements, including radiological imaging, endoscopic evaluations, and newer monitoring techniques, have refined clinical assessment. Treatment paradigms for TEF vary from minimally invasive endoscopic interventions, to traditional open and innovative surgical approaches. Conservative management, such as nutritional and anti-infective therapies, remains vital, especially for milder cases. Emerging therapies in regenerative medicine-such as tissue-engineered scaffolds and platelet-rich plasmaoffer transformative potential for refractory cases. Future advancements are oriented toward exploring 3D printing, artificial intelligence, and precision medicine. The necessity of multidisciplinary collaboration is underscored in optimizing holistic patient care. While significant progress has improved cure rates and long-term outcomes, continued research on innovative technologies and clinical trials addressing knowledge gaps in long-term efficacy remains crucial.",

Therefore, the aim of the present systematic review was to explore AASCs applications in various diseases and conditions, including skin lesions, Crohn's disease, glandular dysfunction, kidney disease, spinal muscular atrophy and osteoarthritis. This review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines; PubMed, Embase and Web of Science databases were used to search for studies published between 2011 and 2024, without language restrictions. Our review was strictly limited to the inclusion of controlled clinical trials to ensure the relevance and quality of the data. After screening, 22 articles were retained, with a total of 953 patients that met the established inclusion criteria. The data obtained from these studies showed that AASCs have promising efficacy in improving scars and ulcers, managing Crohn's disease, and treating glandular dysfunction and kidney disease. In spinal muscular atrophy and osteoarthritis, preliminary results also suggested potential benefits. AASCs-based treatments were well tolerated with no major adverse effects, thus emphasizing their favorable safety profile. AASCs show a significant potential for a variety of clinical applications, but the results must be interpreted with caution due to the methodological limitations of the included studies. Well-designed Phase III clinical trials are needed to confirm these promising results and ensure the safe and effective use of AASCs in clinical practice.

The prevention of PJI holds paramount priority and should be integrated throughout the perioperative period. Although diagnostic criteria for PJI have undergone multiple updates, the 2011 MSIS criteria remain the most widely adopted, requiring comprehensive evaluation of laboratory, pathological, and imaging examinations for diagnosis. PJI treatment necessitates combined antibiotic and surgical interventions. Antibiotic therapy includes empirical treatment after diagnosis, targeted therapy following pathogen identification, and suppressive antibiotic therapy(SAT) for non-surgical candidates. Surgical options comprise debridement, antibiotics, and implant retention(DAIR), one-stage/two-stage revision, and salvage procedures.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Implementation of standardized infection prevention protocols, rational antibiotic use, surgical technical innovations, and advancements in biomaterials have contributed to a reduction in PJI incidence. However, the spread of bacterial resistance and multidrug-resistant organisms in healthcare settings pose new challenges for PJI prevention and treatment. In the future, the research and development of new antimicrobial materials, the innovation of biofilm control technology and the application of precision medicine are expected to further reduce the incidence of PJI, improve the quality of life of patients, and promote a breakthrough in the field of arthroplasty regarding this issue.",

A holistic treatment of pCD, addressing different pathophysiological factors, may represent the key for an improvement in the healing rate. In this setting, MSC might play a role as 'augmentation' therapy in combination with more conventional treatments. Whether MSC have benefit in non-complex fistula in biological naïve patients, in complex fistula with many tracts and/or in rectovaginal fistulas, are unexplored fields that need further investigation. A central registry of pCD patients undergoing treatment with MSC should be created in order to elucidate the efficacy, safety and costs of stem cells treatment on long term follow up.",

      "abstract": "This study examined the outcome of surgery for symptomatic Crohn's rectovaginal fistula (RVF) and assessed the effect of therapy with antibody against tumour necrosis factor (TNF) on healing. Fifty-six patients with Crohn's disease underwent surgery for a RVF between January 1993 and December 2006. Outcome analysis was performed in February 2008 in relation to the surgical procedures used and the effect of anti-TNF treatment. Four patients with a healed fistula still had a stoma at final follow-up for other reasons and were excluded from the analysis. Fistula closure was achieved in 81 per cent of the remaining 52 patients. Primary and secondary surgical success rates were 56 and 57 per cent respectively. The primary healing rate was similar in patients who received anti-TNF treatment before the first operation (12 of 18 patients) and those who did not (19 of 34). In univariable analysis, duration of Crohn's disease (P = 0.037) and previous extended colonic resection (P < 0.001) were significantly related to failure of primary surgery, but only the latter remained significant in multivariable analysis (P < 0.001). Late recurrence developed in four patients. Fistula closure was achieved in most patients, but more than one operation was often required.",

      "abstract": "Infliximab, the chimeric monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig)G1 antibody to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has changed our therapy of Crohn's disease. Infliximab is indicated in refractory luminal and fistulizing Crohn's disease. In patients with luminal disease, a single intravenous (i.v.) dose of 5 mg/kg is efficacious; in fistulizing disease, an i.v. loading therapy of 5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, and 6 is advocated. Because the majority of patients will relapse if not re-treated, a long-term strategy is necessary. The optimal long-term approach is systematic re-treatment with 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks. Episodic therapy on relapse also is possible but is less efficacious and frequently is associated with problems resulting from the formation of antibodies to infliximab (ATI). If treatment is episodic, maintenance therapy with immunosuppression (azathioprine [AZA]/6-mercaptopurine [6-MP] or methotrexate) is mandatory. Trial data suggest that systematic maintenance with 8 weekly doses of infliximab decreases the rate of complications, hospitalizations, and surgeries. These effects probably are achieved thanks to thorough healing of the bowel. Infliximab also is indicated in treating corticosteroid-dependent Crohn's disease and extraintestinal manifestations of Crohn's disease. There are no data yet that support its use as first-line therapy. The data in ulcerative colitis (UC) are conflicting and we should await the results of 2 large controlled trials (ACT1 and ACT2) to position infliximab in the treatment of UC. Other anti-TNF strategies have been less effective than infliximab in the treatment of IBD until now. The results with thalidomide are promising but much more research into small molecules inhibiting TNF and other proinflammatory cytokines is necessary. Safety problems with antibody treatment mainly concern immunogenicity leading to infusion reactions, loss of response, and serum sickness-like delayed infusion reactions. The rate of opportunistic infections is increased mainly in patients treated concomitantly with immunosuppression. Other adverse events associated with anti-TNF strategies are demyelinating disease and worsening of congestive heart failure. Malignancy rates in patients treated with anti-TNF strategies do not seem to be increased.",

      "abstract": "Outcome prediction is crucial for head and neck cancer patients as it can provide prognostic information for early treatment planning. Radiomics methods have been widely used for outcome prediction from medical images. However, these methods are limited by their reliance on intractable manual segmentation of tumor regions. Recently, deep learning methods have been proposed to perform end-to-end outcome prediction so as to remove the reliance on manual segmentation. Unfortunately, without segmentation masks, these methods will take the whole image as input, such that makes them difficult to focus on tumor regions and potentially unable to fully leverage the prognostic information within the tumor regions. In this study, we propose a radiomics-enhanced deep multi-task framework for outcome prediction from PET/CT images, in the context of HEad and neCK TumOR segmentation and outcome prediction challenge (HECKTOR 2022). In our framework, our novelty is to incorporate radiomics as an enhancement to our recently proposed Deep Multi-task Survival model (DeepMTS). The DeepMTS jointly learns to predict the survival risk scores of patients and the segmentation masks of tumor regions. Radiomics features are extracted from the predicted tumor regions and combined with the predicted survival risk scores for final outcome prediction, through which the prognostic information in tumor regions can be further leveraged. Our method achieved a C-index of 0.681 on the testing set, placing the 2nd on the leaderboard with only 0.00068 lower in C-index than the 1st place.",

Despite advancements in treatments, pfCD remains challenging to manage with low healing rates. Fecal diversion (FD) has previously demonstrated clinical improvement for patients with refractory disease. Our meta-analysis aimed to explore the clinical response to FD, rates of successful restoration of bowel continuity after FD, rates of re-diversion, and factors affecting the success of FD in pfCD.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out of adult patients who had undergone FD for pfCD, with detailed patient outcome data. Studies were identified through a literature search of six bibliographic databases and one trial register, all run on February 28, 2025, including MEDLINE ALL, EMBASE, Emcare, APA PsycInfo, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and Clinicaltrials.gov.<h4>Results</h4>Seventeen studies encompassing 714 adult pfCD patients were included. FD resulted in a 65% clinical improvement rate, yet considerable heterogeneity existed in study methodologies and outcome definitions. While 29% of patients achieved bowel restoration within a median follow-up of 58.2 months, challenges in sustaining the effects were evident, with 10% requiring repeat diversion and a 37% overall proctectomy/proctocolectomy rate. Factors associated with diversion success included the absence of rectal involvement and quiescent luminal disease, with biologic use showing no impact on outcomes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>FD offers symptom control in pfCD, although restoration rates remain low. These findings emphasize the need for individualized patient counseling. Future research should strive for uniform measures and refined approaches to enhance pfCD management.",

      "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) require effective therapies to prevent morbidity and maintain quality of life. The introduction of biologic agents, beginning with monoclonal antibodies targeting tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, has launched a new era of advancements that have markedly improved short- and long-term outcomes of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Along with these improvements, there have been challenges to address in optimizing use of biologic therapies in children with IBD. Young children may have rapid drug clearance, and growing children have changing medication needs related to changes in body size, metabolism, and development. For these and other reasons, one size (one dose) does not fit all. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), which involves measurement of drug concentration in serum usually, typically at the predose trough, has emerged as a valuable tool for optimizing dosing and preventing pharmacokinetic failure. This society paper reviews the use of TDM, including target ranges during induction and maintenance therapy for anti-TNF agents and for emerging biologics. This report has been compiled by pediatric gastroenterologists on behalf of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition IBD committee after extensive review of the current literature. The purpose of this clinical position statement is to provide guidance to clinicians in the use of TDM to optimize the treatment of children with IBD.",

BioBERT and BioClinicalBERT are two examples of such models that have shown promise in medical NLP tasks. Many of these models are overparametrised and resource-intensive, but thanks to techniques like Knowledge Distillation (KD), it is possible to create smaller versions that perform almost as well as their larger counterparts. In this work, we specifically focus on development of compact language models for processing clinical texts (i.e. progress notes, discharge summaries etc). We developed a number of efficient lightweight clinical transformers using knowledge distillation and continual learning, with the number of parameters ranging from 15 million to 65 million. These models performed comparably to larger models such as BioBERT and ClinicalBioBERT and significantly outperformed other compact models trained on general or biomedical data. Our extensive evaluation was done across several standard datasets and covered a wide range of clinical text-mining tasks, including Natural Language Inference, Relation Extraction, Named Entity Recognition, and Sequence Classification. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study specifically focused on creating efficient and compact transformers for clinical NLP tasks.

Despite the fact that debiased word embeddings do not explicitly address equalized odds of protected groups, we show that a text-specific approach to fairness may simultaneously achieve a good balance of performance and classical notions of fairness.

      "abstract": "Purpose: This goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of a data-driven clinical productivity system that leverages Electronic Health Record (EHR) data to provide productivity decision support functionality in a real-world clinical setting. The system was implemented for a large behavioral health care provider seeing over 75,000 distinct clients a year. Design/methodology/approach: The key metric in this system is a \"VPU\", which simultaneously optimizes multiple aspects of clinical care. The resulting mathematical value of clinical productivity was hypothesized to tightly link the organization's performance to its expectations and, through transparency and decision support tools at the clinician level, affect significant changes in productivity, quality, and consistency relative to traditional models of clinical productivity. Findings: In only 3 months, every single variable integrated into the VPU system showed significant improvement, including a 30% rise in revenue, 10% rise in clinical percentage, a 25% rise in treatment plan completion, a 20% rise in case rate eligibility, along with similar improvements in compliance/audit issues, outcomes collection, access, etc. Practical implications: A data-driven clinical productivity system employing decision support functionality is effective because of the impact on clinician behavior relative to traditional clinical productivity systems. Critically, the model is also extensible to integration with outcomes-based productivity. Originality/Value: EHR's are only a first step - the problem is turning that data into useful information. Technology can leverage the data in order to produce actionable information that can inform clinical practice and decision-making. Without additional technology, EHR's are essentially just copies of paper-based records stored in electronic form.",

      "doi": "",
      "abstract": "Objective: Integrating EHR data with other resources is essential in rare disease research due to low disease prevalence. Such integration is dependent on the alignment of ontologies used for data annotation. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is used to annotate clinical diagnoses; the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) to annotate phenotypes. Although these ontologies overlap in biomedical entities described, the extent to which they are interoperable is unknown. We investigate how well aligned these ontologies are and whether such alignments facilitate EHR data integration.   Materials and Methods: We conducted an empirical analysis of the coverage of mappings between ICD and HPO. We interpret this mapping coverage as a proxy for how easily clinical data can be integrated with research ontologies such as HPO. We quantify how exhaustively ICD codes are mapped to HPO by analyzing mappings in the UMLS Metathesaurus. We analyze the proportion of ICD codes mapped to HPO within a real-world EHR dataset.   Results and Discussion: Our analysis revealed that only 2.2% of ICD codes have direct mappings to HPO in UMLS. Within our EHR dataset, less than 50% of ICD codes have mappings to HPO terms. ICD codes that are used frequently in EHR data tend to have mappings to HPO; ICD codes that represent rarer medical conditions are seldom mapped.   Conclusion: We find that interoperability between ICD and HPO via UMLS is limited. While other mapping sources could be incorporated, there are no established conventions for what resources should be used to complement UMLS.",

In this study, we undertook, to our knowledge, the first domain adaptation of sentiment analysis to psychiatric EHRs by defining psychiatric clinical sentiment, performing an annotation project, and evaluating multiple sentence-level sentiment machine learning (ML) models. Results indicate that off-the-shelf sentiment analysis tools fail in identifying clinically positive or negative polarity, and that the definition of clinical sentiment that we provide is learnable with relatively small amounts of training data. This project is an initial step towards further refining sentiment analysis methods for clinical use. Our long-term objective is to incorporate the results of this project as part of a machine learning model that predicts inpatient readmission risk.

We demonstrate that using a domain-specific model yields performance improvements on three common clinical NLP tasks as compared to nonspecific embeddings.

      "abstract": "<h4>Purpose</h4>The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinico-radiological remission rate in patients with fistulizing anoperineal lesions of Crohn's disease treated with CT-P13 SC, as well as pharmacokinetic data and treatment persistence rate.<h4>Methods</h4>We included all consecutive patients seen in the dedicated proctology outpatient clinic between June 1st and July 15th, 2024, for fistulizing anoperineal lesions and treated for at least 3 months with CT-P13 SC. Clinical, radiological and pharmacokinetic data were collected.<h4>Results</h4>Data from 39 patients were analyzed. The median duration of treatment was 16.1 months. Seventeen patients (43.6%) had initiated SC formulation upfront. The complete clinical remission rate was 74.4%, significantly higher in patients switched from IV to SC formulation. Among patients switched from IV to SC formulation, 86.5% maintained remission. In the overall study population, 89.7% were able to continue treatment, with intensified protocols in 61.5% of patients. The deep radiological remission rate was 61.5%. The median infliximab concentration was 22.7 µg/mL. Only the intensified administration protocol was significantly associated with higher infliximab concentrations. Immunosuppressants had no impact. The median infliximab concentration was higher in patients in remission (35.9 µg/mL vs 22.4 µg/mL), but without any significant difference.<h4>Conclusion</h4>CT-P13 SC appears to be at least as effective as the IV formulation for fistulizing anoperineal lesions, and switching from IV to SC allows remission to be maintained in the vast majority of cases. Despite numerically higher infliximab concentrations in patients in remission, no significant difference could be identified.

      "abstract": "Anal fistula is a common benign perianal condition, and its malignant transformation, particularly into squamous cell carcinoma, is rare and often associated with comorbidities such as Crohn's disease and HIV infection. This article reports the case of a 66-year-old male with a history of recurrent anal fistula spanning more than 10 years who underwent 3 surgical treatments. Pathological findings from the first two surgeries showed no malignant lesions, while the third confirmed moderately to poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The patient had a history of lymphoma and small bowel resection; HIV infection was excluded upon admission. Carcinoembryonic antigen and cytokeratin 19 fragment levels were mildly elevated, and imaging revealed a high complex anal fistula. The diagnosis was ultimately confirmed by pathological biopsy. We propose that malignant transformation may be linked to chronic inflammatory stimulation, reduced immune function, and prior abdominal surgery. Diagnosis depends on pathological confirmation, and the use of multiple imaging modalities can improve diagnostic accuracy. The uniqueness of this case lies in the non-continuous recurrence of the anal fistula, offering a new perspective on the clinical characteristics of anal fistula carcinogenesis.",

      "abstract": "High transsphincteric anal fistulas represent a significant therapeutic challenge due to the risk of fecal incontinence associated with division of the sphincter complex. Management must be individualized, particularly in recurrent cases. We report the case of a 55-year-old male with a recurrent high posterior transsphincteric anal fistula who had undergone multiple previous surgical interventions. Initial treatment with fistulectomies and cryptectomies resulted in disruption of both the internal and external anal sphincters, leading to severe fecal incontinence. Due to persistent fistulous drainage, the patient underwent diagnostic laparoscopy with creation of a protective loop ileostomy, irrigation and drainage of the tract, primary transanal closure of the internal opening, and application of fibrin sealant (Tisseel<sup>®</sup>, Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, IL). In the outpatient setting, tract curettage using a CitoBrush<sup>®</sup> (Medscand AB, Malmö, Sweden) and repeat application of fibrin sealant were performed. Subsequent examination under anesthesia revealed fibrosis without evidence of an active tract. Intestinal continuity was ultimately restored. The patient's postoperative course was favorable, with no recurrence or continence impairment. This case illustrates the importance of a stepwise surgical approach integrating conventional and adjunctive techniques for the treatment of complex anal fistulas. The combined use of sphincteroplasty, temporary fecal diversion, and biological sealants provided effective disease control while preserving sphincter function. Current evidence supports the use of fibrin sealants as adjuncts in fibrotic tracts and the role of temporary diversion in cases involving sphincter disruption. Sequential and patient-specific surgical management led to successful resolution of the fistula without compromising continence. This multidisciplinary strategy may be considered in patients with complex anatomy and a history of multiple surgical failures.",

A 36-year-old male patient with a history of nine previous fistula surgeries presented with persistent symptoms and a newly developed lateral external opening in the right gluteal region. VAAFT was performed under general anesthesia with the patient in the prone position. The fistuloscope was advanced through the external opening, allowing visualization of both the primary and secondary tracts. The internal opening was identified, and the fistulous tracts were thoroughly debrided. A draining seton was placed while preserving the integrity of the sphincter complex. At the four-month follow-up, all secondary tracts had successfully closed. However, due to the presence of false tracts resulting from prior interventions, the primary tract had evolved into a suprasphincteric fistula. The patient remains under regular follow-up with a seton in place and has reported significant improvement in both symptoms and overall quality of life. Our experience indicates that VAAFT is a valuable option in selected cases of complex and recurrent anal fistulas, especially when the internal opening cannot be identified using conventional methods.",

Despite endoscopy representing the reference standard for the diagnosis and assessment of disease activity, radiological imaging has a key role, providing information about mural and extra-visceral involvement. <b>Methods:</b> Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging are the most frequently used radiological techniques in clinical practice for both the diagnosis and staging of CD involving the small bowel in non-urgent settings. The contribution of imaging in the management of CD is reported on by answering the following practical questions: (1) What is the best technique for the assessment of small bowel CD? (2) Is imaging a good option to assess colonic disease? (3) Which disease pattern is present: inflammatory, fibrotic or fistulizing? (4) Is it possible to identify the presence of strictures and to discriminate inflammatory from fibrotic ones? (5) How does imaging help in defining disease extension and localization? (6) Can imaging assess disease activity? (7) Is it possible to evaluate post-operative recurrence? <b>Results:</b> Imaging is suitable for assessing disease activity, extension and characterizing disease patterns. CT and MRI can both answer the abovementioned questions, but MRI has a greater sensitivity and specificity for assessing disease activity and does not use ionizing radiation. <b>Conclusions:</b> Radiologists are essential healthcare professionals to be involved in multidisciplinary teams for the management of CD patients to obtain the necessary answers for clinically relevant questions.",

      "abstract": "Endometriosis is a clinical entity affecting up to 10% of women of reproductive age, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. While extrapelvic endometriosis has been documented, pancreatic endometriosis remains extremely rare and poses significant diagnostic challenges due to its similarity to other pancreatic diseases. At the same time, splenic mesothelial cysts are also rare and typically benign. This report presents a unique case of pancreatic endometriosis coexisting with a splenic mesothelial cyst in a 31-year-old woman. The patient presented to the emergency department with complaints of persistent epigastric and low back pain. She noted having similar symptoms approximately a year prior. Her past medical history was otherwise unremarkable, and there was no known family history of pancreatic disease or neoplasms. Initial imaging revealed a 3.8 cm cystic lesion in the pancreatic tail, with features suggestive of mucinous cystadenoma. Following clinical evaluation and confirmation of the cyst's nature through endoscopic ultrasound-guided biopsy, the patient subsequently underwent laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy due to worsening symptoms. Gross examination revealed a multilocular pancreatic cyst with a smooth, hemorrhagic wall. Microscopic analysis showed the cyst to be lined by cuboidal to columnar epithelium, consistent with pancreatic endometriosis, confirmed by immunohistochemical staining. The spleen showed cystic formations, diagnosed as a multifaceted mesothelial cyst. In conclusion, this report is the first to document the coexistence of pancreatic endometriosis and splenic mesothelial cysts, highlighting the importance of accurate imaging and pathologic evaluation in the diagnosis of these rare conditions. Early diagnosis and surgical intervention lead to favorable outcomes, reinforcing the importance of comprehensive diagnostic strategies.",

Although there are many non-infectious mimics, such as Behcet's, drug-induced enterocolitis, and lymphoma, the main dilemma is differentiating IBD from infection; namely, Crohn's disease (CD) from intestinal tuberculosis (ITB). However, a careful history/examination, targeted investigations, along with histopathology should make it possible to make a definitive diagnosis of IBD in the majority of cases.

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic intestinal inflammatory disorder, the etiology of which remains unknown, and is characterized by symptoms such as chronic abdominal pain, diarrhea, obstruction, and perianal lesions. Histopathology is widely regarded as the preferred method for diagnosing CD, although the histological diagnosis may lack specificity. The identification of granulomas is commonly believed to be the most reliable diagnostic indicator for CD, surpassing all other clinical features in significance. Nevertheless, research indicates that the detection rate of granulomas in CD exhibits considerable variability. Furthermore, granulomas can manifest in various specific infections including tuberculosis and Yersinia, as well as in a range of diseases characterized by macrophage reactions such as sarcoidosis and drug-induced enteritis. Granulomas associated with CD typically do not exhibit necrosis. However, the formation of caseous granulomas may occur as a result of secondary infections related to anti-CD drug treatment or perforation of the intestinal wall.<h4>Case presentation</h4>In this study, we present a case of a 28-year-old female patient diagnosed with CD exhibiting histologic granulomas, including both caseating and non-caseating forms, which demonstrated a positive response to medical treatment.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In clinical practice, various forms of granulomas may indicate diverse underlying diseases, yet lack specificity. It is suggested that the presence of caseous granulomas should not be considered as a definitive exclusion criterion for the diagnosis when clinical, endoscopic, imaging and other histopathological features are consistent with CD. This study is the first report of caseous granulomas in CD without concomitant tuberculosis infection.",

      "abstract": "Radiation-induced intestinal injury (RIII) poses a significant clinical challenge for patients undergoing pelvic or abdominal radiotherapy, characterized by dual features of acute symptoms (diarrhea, abdominal pain, rectal bleeding) and chronic complications (stricture, fistula, chronic pain), profoundly impacting quality of life. Despite high clinical prevalence, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying RIII remain poorly defined, hindering therapeutic development. Current diagnostic modalities (imaging, endoscopy) lack sensitivity and specificity for early detection or real-time monitoring. While biomarkers offer promise for non-invasive assessment and prognosis, existing candidates face limitations in reproducibility and clinical applicability. Therapeutic options, ranging from pharmaceuticals to surgery, show variable efficacy, underscoring the need for optimized strategies. This review systematically explores RIII pathogenesis, emphasizing radiation-induced immune dysregulation, epigenetic alterations, and gut microbiota dysbiosis. We discuss potential biomarkers, such as miRNA, fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs), etc. We categorize therapies into radioprotectors (pre-radiation use) and radiomitigators (post-radiation intervention), highlighting natural plant-derived compounds and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for their multi-target effects, alongside emerging approaches like stem cell and microbiota transplantation, with discussions on their therapeutic potential and clinical challenges. Crucially, we exclusively summarize recent clinical translation advances to accelerate drug development. Through critical evaluation of evidence, we propose future directions to refine risk stratification, enable timely intervention, and improve long-term outcomes for irradiated patients. This integrative analysis aims to bridge translational gaps and prioritize research avenues for RIII management.",

This is a narrative review based on a focused literature search conducted using PubMed and the Cochrane Library. Imaging is not usually recommended in initial consultations for vestibular disorders because only 5-10% of MRI scans reveal findings directly related to the disease. The study is a review of the literature that highlights the utility and limitations of imaging such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It follows the diagnostic approach from history and physical examination to laboratory tests and imaging. Some conditions like vestibular neuritis and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) have limited imaging utility due to the fine details required. Conversely, high-resolution CT and MRI are important for diagnosing Meniere's disease, acoustic neuroma, and superior canal dehiscence. The role of imaging varies a lot among specific conditions.

      "abstract": "Orbital venous-lymphatic malformations (VLMs) are complex vascular anomalies that pose significant challenges to ophthalmologists due to their diverse clinical manifestations and the difficulties inherent in their therapeutic management, particularly given their proximity to critical orbital structures. This narrative review synthesizes the current knowledge on the classification, pathology, molecular mechanisms, imaging characteristics, and therapeutic strategies for VLMs. Historically misclassified as orbital lymphangiomas, VLMs are now recognized as complex malformations comprising interconnected venous and lymphatic components, with the potential for significant complications, including proptosis, visual impairment, and esthetic disturbances. Recent molecular insights have revealed critical pathogenetic mechanisms, particularly mutations in the <i>PIK3CA</i> gene that activate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin transduction network, alongside the upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated signaling. These aberrations not only illuminate the disease etiology but also present promising therapeutic targets. Contemporary management strategies emphasize a multidisciplinary approach, with sclerotherapy emerging as a particularly promising intervention. Sclerosing agents such as bleomycin and pingyangmycin typically yield effective treatment outcomes with relatively favorable safety profiles. Surgical excision is reserved for accessible lesions but often requires adjunctive therapies due to the infiltrative nature of VLMs. Emerging treatments targeting molecular pathways, including PI3K inhibitors and anti-VEGF therapies, show promise in refractory cases. As our understanding deepens, clinicians can now offer more personalized interventions that consider factors such as lesion location, extent, architecture, and hemodynamic characteristics, thereby minimizing morbidity and optimizing clinical and aesthetic outcomes.",

While the etiology of CD is multifactorial, involving genetic, environmental, and immunological factors, recent studies have highlighted the role of food antigens and the gut microbiome in its pathogenesis. This paper explores the immunological underpinnings of CD, with a focus on the elevated levels of serum immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) and their correlation with disease severity and therapeutic response. We review clinical trials and case studies that demonstrate the potential of IgG4-guided exclusion diets and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy in ameliorating CD symptoms and inflammation. Additionally, we delve into advancements in machine learning (ML) models that utilize fecal microbiome data, offering promising diagnostic tools for distinguishing CD from ulcerative colitis and non-IBD conditions. The integration of ML in endoscopy and predictive models for therapy complications signifies a leap toward precision medicine in IBD management. This paper underscores the necessity for a nuanced understanding of CD's immunological aspects and the innovative application of ML in its diagnosis and treatment, paving the way for personalized therapeutic strategies and improved patient outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Lung cancer is a prevalent malignant disease with the highest mortality rate among oncological conditions. The assessment of its clinical TNM staging primarily relies on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the thorax and proximal abdomen, sometimes with the addition of positron emission tomography/CT scans, mainly for better evaluation of mediastinal lymph node involvement and detection of distant metastases. The purpose of TNM staging is to establish a universal nomenclature for the anatomical extent of lung cancer, facilitating interdisciplinary communication for treatment decisions and research advancements. Recent studies utilizing a large international database and multidisciplinary insights indicate a need to update the TNM classification to enhance the anatomical categorization of lung cancer, ultimately optimizing treatment strategies. The eighth edition of the TNM classification, issued by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC), transitioned to the ninth edition on 1 January 2025. Key changes include a more detailed classification of the N and M descriptor categories, whereas the T descriptor remains unchanged. Notably, the N2 category will be split into N2a and N2b based on the single-station or multi-station involvement of ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes, respectively. The M1c category will differentiate between single (M1c1) and multiple (M1c2) organ system involvement for extrathoracic metastases. This review article emphasizes the role of radiologists in implementing the updated TNM classification through CT imaging for correct clinical lung cancer staging and optimal patient management.",

      "abstract": "\n Objectives:\n Arteriovenous fistulae (AVF) are the preferred vascular access for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) but have high rates of primary failure. Models of AVF using mice with chronic kidney disease (CKD) show diminished maturation and increased failure compared to AVF using wild type mice. Since mice with CKD show increased TGF-β1 expression and activity in the AVF model, and TGF-β1 signaling can alter autophagy, we hypothesized that CKD increases autophagy during AVF maturation, whereas inhibition of the smooth muscle cell (SMC) TGF-β receptor would attenuate autophagy and promote AVF maturation.\n \n \n Methods:\n An aortocaval fistula or sham procedure was created in mice that had CKD induced by 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6 Nx) or sham nephrectomy (0/6 Nx).\n \n Myh11-CreER\n T2\n ; Tgfbr1\n fl/fl\n ; Tgfbr2\n fl/fl\n ; mT/mG\n \n mice (TGFβRI II-KO) and control C57BL/6J mice were used. The diameter of the IVC was determined using ultrasound at days 0, 7, 14, and 21. AVF were harvested at day 7 or 21 for histology and immunoreactivity. Deidentified human AVF and control vein specimens were collected for analysis from second stage basilic vein transpositions.\n \n \n Results:\n In C57BL/6J mice, AVF had significantly decreased diameter (p=0.0051), increased wall thickness (p=0.0002), as well as increased immunoreactivity of collagen-1 (p=0.0163), collagen-3 (p=0.0029), TGF-β1 (p=0.0184) and fibronectin (p=0.00321) in mice with CKD compared to control mice (n=6). SMC showed increased markers of autophagy (LC3B and P62) in mice with CKD compared to control mice (LC3B, p<0.0001; P62, p=0.006; n=6); similarly, autophagy makers were increased in human AVF compared with the control veins (LC3B, p=0.0023; P62, p=0.006; n=6). In SMC-TGFβR II-KO mice, AVF had significantly decreased wall thickness (p<0.0001), increased diameter (p=0.0258), and decreased expression of autophagy markers (LC3B, p=0.0014; P62, p=0.0046; n=6).\n \n \n Conclusion:\n CKD increases neointimal hyperplasia that is associated with increased autophagy during AVF failure, and diminished TGF-β signaling reduces autophagy and wall thickness as well as increases AVF diameter. Suppression of SMC autophagy might be a novel therapeutic approach to improve AFV function.\n",

This contrasts with the more frequently seen spinal dural AVF, where the fistula is entirely intradural. Although endovascular repair is commonly performed for spinal eAVF, few cases require open surgical ligation. OBSERVATIONS The authors present a case of a 74-year-old male with progressive thoracic myelopathy secondary to a spinal eAVF. Thoracic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed intramedullary T2 signal hyperintensity from T8 to T12. Spinal angiography revealed a primary arterial supply from the right T11 segmental artery and minor supply from the left T11 branches with drainage into the ventral epidural space. The patient underwent T11–12 laminectomy and complete right T11–12 facetectomy for ligation of the fistula with T11–L1 fusion. A postoperative spinal angiogram showed resolution of the fistula. Postoperatively, the patient’s myelopathy improved, and MRI showed a decrease in T2 cord intensity. LESSONS Spinal eAVFs are rare lesions that differ from the more commonly seen intradural dural AVF in that the abnormal connection is in the epidural space, and they are often associated with a dilated epidural venous pouch.

Its exact pathogenesis remains elusive. Known potential triggers for DAVF include cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), trauma, ear infections, and cranial surgeries. Due to its rarity and diverse clinical presentations, diagnosing DAVF can be a challenge. Case description We present a case of DAVF associated with CVST, manifesting as rapidly advancing parkinsonism accompanied by dementia over a month. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed bilateral symmetric T2 hyperintensities in the basal ganglia and brain stem. Cerebral angiography further confirmed a fistula between the torcular herophili and the transverse-sigmoid sinuses. Despite strong recommendations for transvenous embolization of the fistula, the patient declined the procedure. The anticoagulant therapy and symptomatic treatments administered did not yield any improvement in the patient’s condition. Additionally, we reviewed 27 DAVF-derived parkinsonism and dementia cases. Conclusion DAVF must be considered in the differential diagnosis of cases of rapidly progressive parkinsonism with concurrent dementia. Given its potential for treatment and reversibility, timely diagnosis and intervention for DAVF are paramount.",

(2) Methods: Two unvaccinated 82-year-old patients (one male and one female) presented with acute encephalitis and required intensive care. Serial brain MRI, EEG, CSF analysis, and neurophysiological assessments were performed. (3) Results: Both patients showed rapid progressive neurological deterioration in the context of TBE, confirmed by elevated serum and CSF IgM and IgG titers. Early follow-up MRI revealed striking sulcal hyperintensities on T2/FLAIR sequences, interpreted as protein-rich subarachnoid inflammatory changes. These changes paralleled clinical worsening and resolved on follow-up imaging. The male patient developed meningoencephalomyeloradiculitis, remained comatose, and died from respiratory failure (the brain and spinal cord were examined postmortem). The female patient had meningoencephaloradiculitis with severe dysphagia and was discharged with a modified Rankin Scale score of four. Both patients demonstrated epileptiform EEG activity. The CSF analysis revealed markedly elevated total protein, lactate, tau protein, and CXCL13, as evidence of blood–brain barrier disruption and inflammatory neurodegeneration. (4) Conclusions: We describe acute subarachnoid T2/FLAIR hyperintensity in TBE as an imaging feature that may correlate with severe systemic inflammation and a poor prognosis. This radiological finding could serve as a potential early prognostic marker in TBE.",

However, predicting behaviors like apathy and agitation is challenging due to the large inter- and intra-patient variability. Goal of this paper is to improve the recognition performance by making use of the observation that patients tend to show specific behaviors at certain times of the day or week. We propose to identify such segments of similar behavior via clustering the distributions of annotations of the time segments. All time segments within a cluster then consist of similar behaviors and thus indicate a behavioral predisposition (BPD). We utilize BPDs by training a classifier for each BPD. Empirically, we demonstrate that when the BPD per time segment is known, activity recognition performance can be substantially improved.",

      "abstract": "Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on mobile devices has been demonstrated to be possible using neural models trained on data collected from the device's inertial measurement units. These models have used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs), Transformers or a combination of these to achieve state-of-the-art results with real-time performance. However, these approaches have not been extensively evaluated in real-world situations where the input data may be different from the training data. This paper highlights the issue of data heterogeneity in machine learning applications and how it can hinder their deployment in pervasive settings. To address this problem, we propose and publicly release the code of two sensor-wise Transformer architectures called HART and MobileHART for Human Activity Recognition Transformer. Our experiments on several publicly available datasets show that these HART architectures outperform previous architectures with fewer floating point operations and parameters than conventional Transformers. The results also show they are more robust to changes in mobile position or device brand and hence better suited for the heterogeneous environments encountered in real-life settings.

      "abstract": "Sodium magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is sensitive and specific to ionic balance of cells owing to 10 fold difference in sodium concentration across membrane actively maintained by sodium potassium (Na+ K+) pump. Disruption of the pump and membrane integrity, as seen in neurological disorders such as epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, bipolar disease, and mild traumatic brain injury, leads to a large increase in intracellular sodium. Such a cellular level alteration is however overshadowed by large signal from extracellular sodium, leaving behind a long standing pursuit to separate signals from sodium exhibiting mono vs biexponential transverse (T2) decay under the inherent constraint of low signal to noise ratio even at advanced clinical field of 3 Tesla. Here we propose a novel technique that exploits intrinsic difference in their T2 decays by simply acquiring single quantum images at multiple echo times (TEs) and performing accurate matrix inversion at voxel. This approach was then investigated using numerical models, agar phantoms and human subjects, showing high accuracy of the separation in phantoms (95.8 percent for monoT2 and 72.5 to 80.4 percent for biT2) and clinical feasibility in humans. Thus, sodium MRI at 3T can now facilitate detection of neurological disorders early at cellular level and response to treatment as well.

A pulsatile mass-flow boundary condition is prescribed at the artery inlet of the model, and a three-element Windkessel model at the artery and vein outlets.

This work shows the effectiveness of combining a number of stabilisation techniques to simultaneously overcome the added-mass effect and optimise the efficiency of the overall model.

This report focuses on a patient in the first year of life, who experienced a chronic, consumptive coagulopathy in the setting of a highly vascular enteroatmospheric fistula. Sharing many features with the aforementioned syndrome, this anomaly suggests a novel association of the Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon with a unique vascular malformation.

Long disease duration and severe motor deficits before treatment initiation are generally associated with poor functional outcomes. We report two cases of sdAVF in patients presenting with prolonged symptom duration and severe lower limb paralysis. Despite these unfavourable prognostic indicators, both patients underwent early postoperative rehabilitation aimed at activating the central pattern generator through intensive weight-bearing exercises following surgical treatment. In Case 1, where concomitant spinal degenerative disease was not present, the patient achieved rapid functional improvement and independent ambulation within one week. In contrast, in Case 2, which was complicated by spinal stenosis, ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, and poor obliteration of the abnormal vasculature, the patient demonstrated delayed but steady functional gains, ultimately achieving ambulation with minimal assistance at 13 months postoperatively. These cases suggest that even in patients with sdAVF presenting with long-standing symptoms and severe paralysis, functional recovery is possible with tailored rehabilitation. Complications such as spinal degenerative disorders and incomplete obliteration of the abnormal vasculature may affect the rate and degree of recovery. Early and sustained rehabilitation is essential for managing such high-risk patients.",

The patient was hospitalized due to the rupture of a mass in the right lower abdomen in August 2019. A computed tomography scan demonstrated the spreading of primary cervical cancer to the right lower abdomen, which broke through the skin. In this terminal stage of cervical cancer accompanied with malnutrition, the patient suddenly presented with cognitive impairment, particularly in recent and immediate memory, as well as bilateral sustained nystagmus during hospitalization. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed hyperintensity in the periaqueductal midbrain on T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of WE was made, and thiamine (100 mg) was immediately administered intramuscularly three times a day. After a week, the patient's eye movement disorder and recent memory improved gradually.

      "abstract": "Medical image segmentation has been significantly advanced with the rapid development of deep learning (DL) techniques. Existing DL-based segmentation models are typically discriminative; i.e., they aim to learn a mapping from the input image to segmentation masks. However, these discriminative methods neglect the underlying data distribution and intrinsic class characteristics, suffering from unstable feature space. In this work, we propose to complement discriminative segmentation methods with the knowledge of underlying data distribution from generative models. To that end, we propose a novel hybrid diffusion framework for medical image segmentation, termed HiDiff, which can synergize the strengths of existing discriminative segmentation models and new generative diffusion models. HiDiff comprises two key components: discriminative segmentor and diffusion refiner. First, we utilize any conventional trained segmentation models as discriminative segmentor, which can provide a segmentation mask prior for diffusion refiner. Second, we propose a novel binary Bernoulli diffusion model (BBDM) as the diffusion refiner, which can effectively, efficiently, and interactively refine the segmentation mask by modeling the underlying data distribution. Third, we train the segmentor and BBDM in an alternate-collaborative manner to mutually boost each other. Extensive experimental results on abdomen organ, brain tumor, polyps, and retinal vessels segmentation datasets, covering four widely-used modalities, demonstrate the superior performance of HiDiff over existing medical segmentation algorithms, including the state-of-the-art transformer- and diffusion-based ones. In addition, HiDiff excels at segmenting small objects and generalizing to new datasets. Source codes are made available at https://github.com/takimailto/HiDiff.",

      "abstract": "Human organs constantly undergo anatomical changes due to a complex mix of short-term (e.g., heartbeat) and long-term (e.g., aging) factors. Evidently, prior knowledge of these factors will be beneficial when modeling their future state, i.e., via image generation. However, most of the medical image generation tasks only rely on the input from a single image, thus ignoring the sequential dependency even when longitudinal data is available. Sequence-aware deep generative models, where model input is a sequence of ordered and timestamped images, are still underexplored in the medical imaging domain that is featured by several unique challenges: 1) Sequences with various lengths; 2) Missing data or frame, and 3) High dimensionality. To this end, we propose a sequence-aware diffusion model (SADM) for the generation of longitudinal medical images. Recently, diffusion models have shown promising results in high-fidelity image generation. Our method extends this new technique by introducing a sequence-aware transformer as the conditional module in a diffusion model. The novel design enables learning longitudinal dependency even with missing data during training and allows autoregressive generation of a sequence of images during inference. Our extensive experiments on 3D longitudinal medical images demonstrate the effectiveness of SADM compared with baselines and alternative methods.

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder leading to cognitive decline. [$^{18}$F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([$^{18}$F]-FDG PET) is used to monitor brain metabolism, aiding in the diagnosis and assessment of AD over time. However, the feasibility of multi-time point [$^{18}$F]-FDG PET scans for diagnosis is limited due to radiation exposure, cost, and patient burden. To address this, we have developed a predictive image-to-image translation (I2I) model to forecast future [$^{18}$F]-FDG PET scans using baseline and year-one data. The proposed model employs a convolutional neural network architecture with long-short term memory and was trained on [$^{18}$F]-FDG PET data from 161 individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Our I2I network showed high accuracy in predicting year-two [18F]-FDG PET scans, with a mean absolute error of 0.031 and a structural similarity index of 0.961. Furthermore, the model successfully predicted PET scans up to seven years post-baseline. Notably, the predicted [$^{18}$F]-FDG PET signal in an AD-susceptible meta-region was highly accurate for individuals with mild cognitive impairment across years. In contrast, a linear model was sufficient for predicting brain metabolism in cognitively normal and dementia subjects. In conclusion, both the I2I network and the linear model could offer valuable prognostic insights, guiding early intervention strategies to preemptively address anticipated declines in brain metabolism and potentially to monitor treatment effects.",

Recently, the diffusion probabilistic model (DPM) has shown the potential to generate high-quality images by converting Gaussian random noise into realistic images. In this paper, we apply the DPM to augment the deep ultraviolet fluorescence (DUV) image dataset with an aim to improve breast cancer classification for intraoperative margin assessment. For classification, we divide the whole surface DUV image into small patches and extract convolutional features for each patch by utilizing the pre-trained ResNet. Then, we feed them into an XGBoost classifier for patch-level decisions and then fuse them with a regional importance map computed by Grad-CAM++ for whole surface-level prediction. Our experimental results show that augmenting the training dataset with the DPM significantly improves breast cancer detection performance in DUV images, increasing accuracy from 93% to 97%, compared to using Affine transformations and ProGAN.",

      "doi": "",
      "abstract": "Jump frequencies of 111In/Cd tracer atoms were measured for a series of layered phases LanCoIn3n+2 using the technique of perturbed angular correlation of gamma rays (PAC). The frequencies were determined by analysis of nuclear quadrupole relaxation produced by fluctuating electric field gradients. Samples were synthesized having nominal values n= 1, 2, 3, 5 and \\infty, with n=\\infty corresponding to the L12 phase LaIn3. The phases form heuristically from LaIn3 by replacing every (n+1)th (100) mixed plane of La and In atoms with a plane of Co-atoms. For the n=1 phase, LaCoIn5, jump frequencies were too small to detect. Two signals were observed, one for indium atoms next to the Co-planes and the other for more distant indium atoms. No relaxation was observed for atoms next to the Co-planes, indicating that there is no diffusion across the Co-planes. With increasing n, jump rates for the other In-atoms increased toward values observed for LaIn3. Jump frequency activation enthalpies for n= 3 and 5 were observed to be the same as for n=\\infty, suggesting the same diffusion mechanism. However, the jump-frequency prefactors were found to be smaller for small n, which is attributed to reductions in the connectivity of the diffusion sublattice. We conclude that diffusion in the layered phases is remarkably similar to diffusion in LaIn3 once the reduced connectivity is taken into account.",

      "abstract": "Purpose: Deformable Image Registration (DIR) can benefit from additional guidance using corresponding landmarks in the images. However, the benefits thereof are largely understudied, especially due to the lack of automatic landmark detection methods for three-dimensional (3D) medical images.   Approach: We present a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN), called DCNN-Match, that learns to predict landmark correspondences in 3D images in a self-supervised manner. We trained DCNN-Match on pairs of Computed Tomography (CT) scans containing simulated deformations. We explored five variants of DCNN-Match that use different loss functions and assessed their effect on the spatial density of predicted landmarks and the associated matching errors. We also tested DCNN-Match variants in combination with the open-source registration software Elastix to assess the impact of predicted landmarks in providing additional guidance to DIR.   Results: We tested our approach on lower-abdominal CT scans from cervical cancer patients: 121 pairs containing simulated deformations and 11 pairs demonstrating clinical deformations. The results showed significant improvement in DIR performance when landmark correspondences predicted by DCNN-Match were used in the case of simulated (p = $0e^0$) as well as clinical deformations (p = 0.030). We also observed that the spatial density of the automatic landmarks with respect to the underlying deformation affect the extent of improvement in DIR. Finally, DCNN-Match was found to generalize to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans without requiring retraining, indicating easy applicability to other datasets.   Conclusions: DCNN-Match learns to predict landmark correspondences in 3D medical images in a self-supervised manner, which can improve DIR performance.",

      "abstract": "Diffusion models have shown remarkable success in visual synthesis, but have also raised concerns about potential abuse for malicious purposes. In this paper, we seek to build a detector for telling apart real images from diffusion-generated images. We find that existing detectors struggle to detect images generated by diffusion models, even if we include generated images from a specific diffusion model in their training data. To address this issue, we propose a novel image representation called DIffusion Reconstruction Error (DIRE), which measures the error between an input image and its reconstruction counterpart by a pre-trained diffusion model. We observe that diffusion-generated images can be approximately reconstructed by a diffusion model while real images cannot. It provides a hint that DIRE can serve as a bridge to distinguish generated and real images. DIRE provides an effective way to detect images generated by most diffusion models, and it is general for detecting generated images from unseen diffusion models and robust to various perturbations. Furthermore, we establish a comprehensive diffusion-generated benchmark including images generated by eight diffusion models to evaluate the performance of diffusion-generated image detectors. Extensive experiments on our collected benchmark demonstrate that DIRE exhibits superiority over previous generated-image detectors.

The patient's clinical and neuroimaging data was collected and analyzed. A literature review of pediatric MIE cases reported up to June 2025 was conducted using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, WanFang, and CNKI databases.<h4>Results</h4>A 13-year-old female developed MIE after two courses of metronidazole with cumulative doses of 31.2 g and 37.6 g. Clinical manifestations included altered mental status, ophthalmoplegia, dysarthria, dysphagia, involuntary movements, dystonia, urinary retention, muscle weakness, and absent tendon reflexes. Brain MRI revealed T2W/FLAIR and DWI hyperintensities symmetrically involving the dentate nuclei, splenium of corpus callosum, basal ganglia, thalamus, midbrain, and pons. After discontinuing metronidazole and vitamin B1 therapy, the patient's symptoms gradually improved, though extrapyramidal symptoms persisted. Repeated brain MRI at 10 days after cessation showed lesions partially resolved. Literature review identified 18 pediatric MIE cases, totaling 19 cases including our case. Except for one infant case presenting with intermittent hypothermia, bradycardia, growth retardation, reduced activity, muscle weakness and hypotonia, the predominant neurological symptoms in the other 18 cases were ataxia (11/18), altered mental status (8/18), dysarthria (7/18), and epileptic seizures (5/18). Symmetric brain MRI lesions involving dentate nuclei (13/17), splenium of corpus callosum (9/17), midbrain (6/17), pons (5/17). Most patients (17/19) achieved complete clinical resolution and brain MRI improvement after metronidazole withdrawal.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Pediatric MIE is rare and manifests with widespread neurological involvement, characterized by cerebellar dysfunction, altered mental status, and seizures. Brain MRI typically reveals symmetrical lesions in the dentate nuclei, splenium of corpus callosum, and midbrain. Timely drug discontinuation is critical for treatment, and most cases are reversible, though a few may leave neurological sequelae.",

      "abstract": "We present the case of a 64-year-old woman who developed a postoperative small bowel-cutaneous enterocutaneous fistula (ECF) following excision of a large sigmoid mesenteric duplication cyst. Mesenteric duplication cysts are rare congenital anomalies, most frequently arising in the ileum, with sigmoid involvement being exceptionally uncommon in adults. They may present with abdominal pain, mass effect, or be discovered incidentally, and complete surgical excision is the treatment of choice. However, postoperative complications such as ECF formation are uncommon and can be challenging to manage. In this case, the patient underwent elective resection of a large sigmoid mesenteric duplication cyst, which was densely adherent to adjacent small bowel loops and the anterior abdominal wall. The immediate postoperative period was complicated by persistent purulent wound discharge and localised abdominal wall erythema. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography demonstrated a fistulous tract originating from a segment of small bowel and communicating with the anterior abdominal wall skin. Microbiological cultures from wound swabs grew mixed enteric organisms, guiding targeted antibiotic therapy. Given the patient's hemodynamic stability, absence of diffuse peritonitis, and low-to-moderate fistula output, a conservative management approach was adopted. This included total parenteral nutrition to achieve bowel rest and correct nutritional deficiencies, regular wound care, and intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics adjusted according to microbiology results. Over subsequent weeks, the fistula output progressively decreased, wound healing improved, and inflammatory markers normalised. Follow-up imaging demonstrated near-complete closure of the fistulous tract. Surgical re-intervention was avoided. This case highlights that, in appropriately selected patients, conservative management of postoperative small bowel-cutaneous fistulas can lead to excellent outcomes. Factors favouring nonoperative treatment included the patient's clinical stability, controlled sepsis, adequate nutritional support, and the absence of distal obstruction. The role of multidisciplinary care, involving surgeons, radiologists, microbiologists, and nutrition specialists, was critical in achieving a favourable result. We also underscore the rarity of sigmoid mesenteric duplication cysts in the adult population and the importance of recognising fistula formation as a possible complication when the lesion is adherent to the small bowel and anterior abdominal wall. Individualised treatment planning remains essential, balancing the risks of surgery against the potential for spontaneous fistula closure under optimal conservative care.",

We describe a 72-year-old woman with advanced high-grade serous ovarian cancer who underwent interval cytoreductive surgery including bilateral diaphragmatic peritonectomy. Despite achieving optimal cytoreduction (RT 0), her postoperative course was complicated by the onset of dyspnea and hydropneumothorax. A contrast-enhanced CT scan demonstrated a fistulous tract between the gastric fundus and the pleural cavity. She underwent partial gastrectomy, diaphragmatic repair, and thoracic washout, with resolution of the fistula. No adjuvant chemotherapy was given, and disease recurrence occurred after five months, treated with carboplatin plus gemcitabine. This case illustrates that GPF, although extremely uncommon in gynecologic oncology, can occur after extensive diaphragmatic surgery in multimorbid and heavily pre-treated patients. A narrative review of the literature highlights common mechanisms-including tissue ischemia, impaired healing, and oncologic treatments-across both gynecologic and non-gynecologic cases.

      "abstract": "Insufficient blood supply to free jejunal grafts after total pharyngo-laryngo-esophagectomy (TPLE) occurs primarily due to failure of the vascular anastomosis, often resulting in rapid graft necrosis. This report details a case of ischemic enteritis caused by an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) in the mesentery of the free jejunal graft, resulting in chronic stenosis and total removal of the jejunal graft. A 61-year-old woman diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervical and thoracic esophagus underwent TPLE with gastric conduit and free jejunal graft reconstruction. The third jejunal artery and vein were anastomosed to the left transverse cervical artery and the internal jugular vein, respectively. On postoperative day (POD) 9, leakage was observed at the free jejunal-gastric anastomosis. The fistula healed with conservative treatment but a stenosis at the pharyngeal-jejunal anastomosis developed. Endoscopic observation after balloon dilation of the stenosis showed mucosal hemorrhage and ulcer scarring in the jejunal graft. A 3D reconstructed contrast-enhanced CT revealed the presence of an AVF in the free jejunal mesentery despite well-preserved blood flow across the vascular anastomosis. As no local inflammation was observed in the neck, and oral intake was sufficient after balloon dilatation, she was discharged from hospital. Seven months after surgery, she was admitted to our hospital due to obstruction of the pharyngeal-jejunal anastomosis with cutaneous fistula. Based on the disease course and endoscopic findings of the free jejunal graft, she was diagnosed with cutaneous fistula with scarring obstruction following chronic ischemic enteritis, considered difficult to heal with conservative treatment. Total removal of the free jejunum and reconstruction with an antero-lateral femoral thigh (ALT) flap was performed at 8 months after initial surgery. Oral intake was allowed on POD13, and she was discharged in good condition on POD30. We report here a rare case of late graft failure after TPLE due to chronic ischemia from an AVF in the mesentery of the free jejunal graft. Detailed assessment of mesenteric blood flow by 3D-constructed contrast-enhanced CT is useful and early removal of the ischemic jejunal graft is suggested.",

Lymphomas accompanied by TEFs/BEFs have a more favorable prognosis than solid tumors. Here, we present a unique case of a 74-year-old patient with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed TEF, aspiration pneumonia, and multiple lymphadenopathy. Histopathology helped confirm DLBCL, leading to a Lugano IIE staging. Complete DLBCL remission could be achieved by adjusting chemotherapy dosages for complications, which also resulted in spontaneous TEF resolution without requiring interventions such as stent insertion or surgical correction. No instances of lymphoma recurrence or tracheoesophageal fistula were observed 46 months post-chemotherapy. Among 33 documented cases, this is the first instance of DLBCL-associated TEF resolution through chemotherapy. Notably, in patients initially presenting with a fistula prior to treatment initiation, a favorable response to chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy coupled with controlled aspiration could potentially lead to the resolution of the fistula. Collectively, our case highlights the potential for conservative fistula management and the possibility of spontaneous resolution with chemotherapy.

      "abstract": "Injectable platelet-rich fibrin (i-PRF) is a novel platelet concentrate that has been employed in dentistry with the objective of promoting tissue regeneration and healing. In contrast to platelet-rich plasma (PRP), i-PRF is more straightforward to handle, more cost-effective, and free from anticoagulants, which reduces biochemical alterations. The i-PRF procedure was developed in 2014 by adjusting the centrifugation forces. The resulting product remains in a liquid state for approximately 15 minutes, gradually transforming into a growth factor-rich clot that releases continuously over 10-14 days. It has demonstrated efficacy in a range of dental applications. In periodontology, i-PRF is an effective treatment for periodontitis, enhancing gingival thickness and reducing inflammation, plaque, and recession. Furthermore, it enhances the outcomes of periodontal regenerative surgery and lichen planus treatment. In oral surgery, i-PRF has been shown to facilitate bone regeneration, fistula resolution, and sinus augmentation. Orthodontic studies have indicated that i-PRF accelerates tooth movement and bone remodeling. However, osteomicroperforation remains more effective for some treatments. A limited number of endodontic studies have indicated that i-PRF may support revascularisation and periapical healing. In conclusion, i-PRF's regenerative capabilities, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties offer significant potential in dentistry, and further exploration and application is therefore warranted.",

There are no detailed reports on diverticulum after enucleation of uterine fibroids. Most cases are treated with hysteroscopy or laparoscopy, but a management consensus is lacking. We treated a patient with a uterine diverticulum that had formed after uterine fibroid enucleation by combining hysteroscopic and laparoscopic treatments. The patient was a 37-year-old Japanese woman, G1P0. A previous doctor had performed abdominal uterine myomectomy for a pedunculated subserosal uterine fibroid on the right side of the posterior wall of the uterus near the internal cervical os. Menstruation resumed postoperatively, but a small amount of dark-red bleeding persisted. MRI two months after the myomectomy revealed a diverticulum-like structure 3 cm in diameter, communicating with the uterine lumen, on the right side of the posterior wall of the uterus. Under suspicion of uterine diverticulum after uterine fibroid enucleation, the patient sought treatment at our hospital approximately four months after the myomectomy. Through a flexible hysteroscope, a 5-mm-diameter fistula was observed in the posterior wall of the uterus, and a contrast-enhanced pocket, measuring approximately 3 cm, was located behind it. Uterine diverticulum following enucleation of a uterine fibroid was diagnosed, and surgery was thus deemed necessary. The portion entering the fistula on the internal cervical os side was resected employing a hysteroscope. Intra-abdominal findings included a 4-cm mass lesion on the posterior wall on the right side of the uterus. The mass was opened, and the cyst capsule was removed. A 5-mm fistula was detected and closed with sutures. Resuturing was not performed after dissection of the right round ligament due to tension. The postoperative course has been good to date, with no recurrence. Uterine diverticula after myomectomy may be treated with a combined laparoscopic and hysteroscopic approach, similar to caesarean scar syndrome.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of gadoxetic acid disodium-enhanced magnetic resonance cholangiography to detect postoperative biliary leaks and avoid invasive cholangiography in case of peripheral location of the fistula. Patients with grade B biliary leak after complex liver resection from January 2018 to March 2020 underwent magnetic resonance cholangiography to guide the management of the leak (study group). The primary endpoint was the ability of magnetic resonance cholangiography to reduce the need for invasive cholangiography with respect to similar posthepatectomy leaks collected in the previous 2 years and approached with upfront invasive cholangiography (controls). A series of in-hospital outcomes also were compared. Out of 533 liver resections, 11 study patients versus 11 control patients with grade B leaks were compared. Magnetic resonance cholangiography achieved 100% accuracy in detection and location of the leak. Five out of 6 peripheral leaks healed without invasive cholangiography. Overall, 50% reduction in the use of invasive cholangiography was observed in the study versus control patients. Median healing time and hospital stay were 38 and 40 days in patients undergoing invasive cholangiography versus 10 and 11 days in patients treated conservatively (P = .007 and 0.012, respectively). Infection rate and other complications rate were 82% vs 20% (P = .01) and 35% vs 40% (P = .5), respectively. Magnetic resonance cholangiography is a safe, precise, noninvasive tool to detect posthepatectomy bile leaks that can help clinicians in decision-making on conservative versus invasive treatment of fistulas.",

Non-invasiveness, low cost and good reproducibility make IUS attractive. Leveraging on the Authors' long-term field experience, this review focuses on the IUS role in IBD patients' clinical management. For detecting IBD, particularly Crohn's disease, the IUS parameters - above all the evidence of a thickened bowel wall (BWT) - show very good diagnostic accuracy similar to that of MRI or CT scan. The standard IUS parameters are not accurate enough to detect inflammatory activity, but intravenous contrast-enhanced US (CEUS) is highly accurate in ruling active inflammation out. However, its routinely use remains limited in clinical practice and its parameters need standardization. IUS is accurate in detecting IBD main complications: in particular, fistulae and abscesses. As to stenosis the recent introduction of IUS-based elastographic techniques allows to differentiate prevalently inflammatory from highly fibrotic strictures. IUS proves valid also for monitoring IBD patients.

      "abstract": "Accidental foreign body ingestion is a common phenomenon in children between 6 months to 6 years of age. In adults, foreign body ingestion is commonly observed in the geriatric population and in patients with psychiatric disorders. Over 80% of ingested foreign bodies pass uneventfully through the intestinal tract. Endoscopic retrieval is needed in about 20% while surgical intervention is indicated in less than 1%. Herein we report an extremely rare case of esophagocutaneous fistula following operative retrival of an impacted denture in the esophagus with spontaneous healing within 3 weeks. A similar case to the best of our knowledge has so far not been reported previously. A case of accidental ingestion of a dental prosthesis in a 35-year old schizophrenic patient is presented. The patient was referred to our department after accidentally swallowing one of his dental prosthesis. Surgical retrieval was indicated after two unsuccessful endoscopic retrieval attempts<b>.</b> The denture was retrieved following a longitudinal incision of the esophagus via a left cervical approach. The postoperative course was complicated by a clinically suspected esophagocutaneous fistula which was managed conservatively via nothing per os with enteral feeding via a nasogastric tube. Secretion ceased 3 weeks later and a fistula could not be found on contrast enhanced radiographic examination with gastrographin®. Esophagocutaneous fistula represents a rare but serious complication following foreign body ingestion. An interdisciplinary management including an early surgical consultation should be considered in patients with foreign body impaction in the esophagus following failure of endoscopic retrieval.",

      "abstract": "The necessity to develop new treatment options for challenging procedures in hernia surgery is becoming even more evident and tissue engineering and biological technologies offer even newer strategies to improve fascial healing. The present case reports a patient-tailored surgical technique performed to repair a grade IV abdominal incisional hernia, with a combined use of platelet-rich plasma and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells, implanted on a biological mesh. A 71 year-old female patient complained of an abdominal incisional hernia, complicated by enterocutaneous fistula, four-months following laparostomy. Contrast enhanced computed tomography showed an incisional hernia defect of 15.5×20cm, with a subcutaneous abscess and an intestinal loop adherent to the anterior abdominal wall, with a concomitant enterocutaneous fistula. Surgery involved abdominal wall standardized technique closure, with in addition platelet-rich plasma and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells implanted on a biological mesh. Two years follow up showed no recurrences of incisional hernia. Coating surgical meshes with patient's own cells may improve biocompatibility, by reducing inflammation and adhesion formation. Moreover, platelet-rich plasma is a good source of growth factors for wound healing, as well as a good medium for bone marrow multinucleate cells introduction into fascial repair. This approach is likely to improve abdominal wall repair in high grade (IV) incisional hernia, with the real possibility of improving prosthetic compatibility and reducing future recurrences. The authors agree with the necessity of further studies and trials to assure the safety profile and superiority of this procedure.",

The dAVF was treated radically via ligation of the fistula, without any complications. Postoperative angiography demonstrated that the dAVF had completely healed, but showed an aberrant, dilatated, and tortuous internal mammary artery. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan revealed multiple arterio-arterial fistulas between various systemic arteries and the pulmonary artery(an intercostal artery to the pulmonary artery fistula, an internal mammary artery to the pulmonary artery fistula, and an inferior phrenic artery to the pulmonary artery fistula). These thoracic lesions did not require additional treatment because they did not cause any symptoms, e.g., respiratory or cardiac failure. In most previous cases, such aberrant thoracic arterial fistulas were detected incidentally or based on the presence of minor clinical symptoms. However, in some cases, they caused severe respiratory or cardiac failure and were treated via the embolization of the responsible vessels. Therefore, the co-existence of thoracic arterial fistulas in patients with dAVF should be evaluated, even if the dAVF does not meet the criteria for HHT. Such thoracic lesions might cause a chest murmur that can be detected via a stethoscope or via a blunt costophrenic angle on chest radiography.",

      "abstract": "Crohn's disease is a disorder characterized by transmural inflammation which can potentially affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the perianal area. Cohn's disease is a systemic disease characterized by a relapsing remitting course, with variable intestinal and extra-intestinal complications. Abdominal and pelvic abscesses are not an uncommon complication of Crohn's disease occurring in 10-30 percent of all patients. We present the case of a 21-year-old male with Crohn's disease presenting with a massive abdominal abscess, whose diagnosis was delayed given lack of typical symptoms. Shortly after initiating therapy with Prednisone and Adalimumab he presented with worsening abdominal distention. Cross sectional imaging of the abdomen with IV contrast (Figure 1) demonstrated a 34cm x 23 cm x 11 cm rim-enhancing fluid collections in the abdomen and pelvis consistent with a large intra-abdominal abscess. He underwent an exploratory laparotomy, abdominal washout, and wound vacuum placement. Five liters of purulent fluid were aspirated and cultures grew citrobacter, veillonella and candida glabrata. A bowel perforation was suspected as the etiology for abscess formation; however magnetic resonance heterography (Figure2) was unremarkable. He was treated with appropriate antibiotics, antifungal agents, and was started on Aprisa. His course was complicated with recurrence of intra-abdominal abscesses and a colocutaneous fistula for which he underwent an open sigmoidectomy with a diverting loop colostomy. After condirmation of healing with repeat imaging, he was an uneventful postoperative course. He followed as an outpatient and continues to do well on Infliximab. Most abscesses are picked up in their early stages given characteristic symptoms; however in presence of immunosuppressive therapy the host immune system can be suppressed leading to delayed diagnosis. The presence of a massive intra-abdominal purulent fluid collection of this size has not been described on our review of the literature. Furthermore, despite the abscess taking up most of the abdominal cavity, the fairly limited symptom burden highlights the importance of having high degree of clinical suspicion for infectious compications in Crohn's disease patients even when classical symptoms are not present.",

Our model determines the size distribution of the correlation volume using a grand canonical ensemble through a free energy advantage parameter. Choosing a healing rate that is proportional to the number of undamaged molecules in a correlated region, and a decay rate proportional to the intensity normalized to the correlation volume, the ensemble average is shown to correctly predict decay and recovery of the population of disperse orange 11-DO11 (1-amino-2-methylanthraquinone) molecules doped in PMMA polymer as a function of time and concentration as measured with amplified spontaneous emission and linear absorption spectroscopy using only three parameters that apply to the full set of data. Our model also predicts the temperature dependence of the process. One set of parameters should be characteristic of a particular polymer and dopant chromophore combination. Thus, use of the model in determining these parameters for various materials systems should provide the data needed to test fundamental models of the underlying mechanism responsible for self healing.",

An important challenge is the contagion of failure from one system to another, that can lead to large scale cascading failures. On the other hand, self-healing ability emerges as a valuable opportunity where the overlay cyber network can cure failures in the underlying physical network. To capture both self-healing and contagion, we introduce a factor graph representation of inter-dependent cyber-physical systems in which factor nodes represent various node functionalities and the edges capture the interactions between the nodes. We develop a message passing algorithm to study the dynamics of failure propagation and healing in this representation. Through applying a fixed-point analysis to this algorithm, we investigate the network reaction to initial disruptions. Our analysis provides simple yet critical guidelines for choosing network parameters to achieve resiliency against cascading failures.",

      "abstract": "Healing of soft biological tissue is the process of self-recovering or self-repairing the injured or damaged extracellular matrix (ECM). Healing is assumed to be stress-driven, with the objective of returning to a homeostatic stress metrics in the tissue after replacing the damaged ECM with new undamaged one. However, based on the existence of intrinsic length-scales in soft tissues, it is thought that computational models of healing should be non-local. In the present study, we introduce for the first time two gradient-enhanced con-stitutive healing models for soft tissues including non-local variables. The first model combines a continuum damage model with a temporally homogenized growth model, where the growth direction is determined according to local principal stress directions. The second one is based on a gradient-enhanced healing model with continuously recoverable damage variable. Both models are implemented in the finite-element package Abaqus by means of a user sub-routine UEL. Three two-dimensional situations simulating the healing process of soft tissues are modeled numerically with both models, and their application for simulation of balloon angioplasty is provided by illustrating the change of damage field and geometry in the media layer throughout the healing process.",

      "abstract": "Interdependent networks are characterized by two kinds of interactions: The usual connectivity links within each network and the dependency links coupling nodes of different networks. Due to the latter links such networks are known to suffer from cascading failures and catastrophic breakdowns. When modeling these phenomena, usually one assumes that a fraction of nodes gets damaged in one of the networks, which is followed possibly by a cascade of failures. In real life the initiating failures do not occur at once and effort is made replace the ties eliminated due to the failing nodes. Here we study a dynamic extension of the model of interdependent networks and introduce the possibility of link formation with a probability w, called healing, to bridge non-functioning nodes and enhance network resilience. A single random node is removed, which may initiate an avalanche. After each removal step healing sets in resulting in a new topology. Then a new node fails and the process continues until the giant component disappears either in a catastrophic breakdown or in a smooth transition. Simulation results are presented for square lattices as starting networks under random attacks of constant intensity. We find that the shift in the position of the breakdown has a power-law scaling as a function of the healing probability with an exponent close to 1. Below a critical healing probability, catastrophic cascades form and the average degree of surviving nodes decreases monotonically, while above this value there are no macroscopic cascades and the average degree has first an increasing character and decreases only at the very late stage of the process. These findings facilitate to plan intervention in case of crisis situation by describing the efficiency of healing efforts needed to suppress cascading failures.",

However, postoperative pancreatic fistula(POPF) is the most intractable complication causing relevant mortality. Moreover, pancreatic juice may exude from the wound that would lead to more serious complications. Tapering pressure of wall vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy is considered one of the best treatment to wound exudation. Here, we report on a single center series of 5 POPF cases accompanying wound exudation following open or Laparoscopic-assisted pancreatoduodenectomy, successfully managed by VAC.<h4>Methods</h4>We enrolled all patients who experienced POPF ensuing wound exudation following open or Laparoscopic-assisted pancreatoduodenectomy (OPD or LAPD) and received tapering pressure of vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy between July 2017 and August 2024. For VAC, we utilized wall suction device devised by our center applying the technique of negative pressure wound therapy(NPWT). And we adjusted the tapering pressure of the abdominal wound wall vacuum which fixed to a 8Fr or 12Fr suction catheter and connected to the pressure regulator between -50 and -100 mmHg according to the wound exudation amount. When the amount of the wound exudation were less than 100 ml, the wall vacuum suction catheter could be connected to the negative pressure balloon so that the patients could be able to get out of bed. The wall vacuum of VAC was removed when the pancreatic fistula had sufficiently healed which resulting in complete wound healing.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 60 patients underwent OPD or LAPD. Among them, 9 had occured clinically related pancreatic fistulaI(CR-POPF)according to International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula grade (POPF; 30%). one of the 3 grade C patients underwent Re-laparotomy due to the completely separated pancreaticojejunostomy and postoperative hemorrhage. 5 of the 6 grade B patients was performed tapering pressure of wall vacuum-assisted closure therapy for pancreatic juice exudation from the wound, and all of these patients had good outcomes by this VAC therapy.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Tapering pressure of wall VAC therapy could be a safe and effective treatment in the management of POPF ensuing wound exudation following open or Laparoscopic-assisted pancreatoduodenectomy. And this therapy may potentially reduce POPF-associated mortality.",

We report a case involving a utero-pelvic fistula and a pelvic-parasitic myoma following hysteroscopic resection of a recurrent submucosal myoma.<h4>Case presentation</h4>A 37-year-old woman who had undergone surgery for laparoscopic myomectomy of large uterine fibroids presented with abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) for over 6 months and 4 years ago. One year ago, the patient returned to the hospital due to abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB); both transabdominal sonography (TS) and dynamic pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed submucosal myomas that were subsequently removed hysteroscopically. On a subsequent visit, the patient returned for the third time due to recurrent AUB. She eventually underwent a laparoscopic myomectomy of uterine fibroids after transabdominal sonography (TS) detected a uterine myoma, and dynamic pelvic MRI revealed a uterine myoma at the base of the uterus that locally penetrated the uterine serosal surface, as well as a small leiomyoma in the left utero-rectal fossa.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In rare cases, recurring submucosal myoma after hysteroscopic surgery can breach the surface of the uterine serosa, leading to utero-pelvic fistula and pelvic-parasitic myoma. Preoperative enhanced MRI examinations can aid clinicians in choosing appropriate surgical methods, thereby avoiding the risk of misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "The PISA-II trial showed that short-term anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy followed by surgical closure induces radiological healing of perianal fistulas in patients with Crohn's disease more frequently than anti-TNF therapy alone after 18 months. This study aimed to compare long-term outcomes of both treatment arms. Follow-up data were collected from patients who participated in the PISA-II trial, an international patient preference randomised controlled trial. This multicentre trial was performed in nine hospitals in the Netherlands and one hospital in Italy. Patients with Crohn's disease above the age of 18 years with an active high perianal fistula and a single internal opening were asked to participate. Patients were allocated to anti-TNF therapy (intravenous infliximab, or subcutaneous adalimumab, at the discretion of the gastroenterologist) for one year, or surgical closure combined with 4-months anti-TNF therapy. Patients without a treatment preference were randomised (1:1) using random block randomisation (block sizes of six without stratification), and patients with a treatment preference were treated according to their preferred treatment arm. For the current follow-up study, data were collected until May 2022. Primary outcome was radiological healing on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including all participants with a MRI made less than 6 months ago at the time of data collection. Analysis was based on observed data. Between September 14, 2013, and December 7, 2019, 94 patients were enrolled in the trial. Long-term follow-up data were available in 91 patients (36/38 (95%) anti-TNF + surgical closure, 55/56 (98%) anti-TNF). A total of 14/36 (39%) patients in the surgical closure arm were randomly assigned, which was not significantly different in the anti-TNF treatment arm (16/55 (29%) randomly assigned). Median follow-up was 5.7 years (interquartile range (IQR) 5-7). Radiological healing occurred significantly more often after anti-TNF + surgical closure (15/36 = 42% versus 10/55 = 18%; P = 0.014). Clinical closure was comparable (26/36 = 72% versus 34/55 = 62%; P = 0.18) in both groups. However, clinical closure in the surgical group was achieved with less re-interventions 4/26 (= 15%) versus 18/34 (= 53%), including (redo-)surgical closure procedures. Recurrences occurred in 0/25 (0%) patients with radiological healing versus 27/76 (36%) patients with clinical closure, sometime during follow-up. Anti-TNF trough levels were higher in patients with long-term clinical closure in both groups (P = 0.031 and P = 0.014). In 6/11 (55%) patients in the anti-TNF group with available trough levels, recurrences were diagnosed within three months of a drop under 3.5ug/ml. 36 patients stopped anti-TNF, after which 0/14 (0%) patients with radiological healing developed a recurrence and 9/22 (41%) with clinical closure. Self-rated (in)continence was comparable between groups, and 79% (60/76) of patients indicated comparable/improved continence after treatment. Decision-regret analysis showed that all (30/30) anti-TNF + surgical closure patients agreed or strongly agreed that surgery was the right decision versus 78% (36/46) in the anti-TNF arm. All surgical closure patients would go for the same treatment again, whereas this was 89% (41/46) in the anti-TNF arm. This study confirmed that surgical closure should be considered in amenable patients with perianal fistulas and Crohn's disease as long-term outcomes were favourable, and that radiological healing should be the aim of treatment as recurrences only occurred in patients without radiological healing. In patients with complete MRI closure, anti-TNF could be safely stopped. None.",

Further, relevant journals were manually searched for relevant references, and two researchers independently performed literature search and screening, data extraction, and bias assessment. Stata version 12.0 was utilized to statistically analyze the healing rate of the anal fistula and the incidence of adverse events.<h4>Results</h4>This study involved 1,056 patients from five randomized controlled trials, including 561 patients in the treatment group (ASCs/ASCs + fibrin glue) and 495 patients in the control group (fibrin glue/placebo). Meta-analysis revealed better short- and long-term efficacy of adipose mesenchymal stem cell treatment for complex perianal fistulas than in conventional treatment. However, no statistical difference was observed between mid-term and ultra-long-term treatments. Subgroup meta-analysis demonstrated a difference in efficacy between various cell doses. Further, all treatments with different sources of ASCs were superior to conventional quality.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study confirms that Adipose-derived Stem Cells can effectively improve short-term and long-term (1-year) clinical outcomes in patients with complex perianal fistulas, supporting their potential as a novel therapeutic strategy.<h4>Systematic review registration</h4>https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD42024602327.",

It has been suggested that failure is due to ongoing disease in the remaining fistula tract. Cytokines play an important role in inflammation. At present, biologicals targeting cytokines are available. Therefore, detection and identification of cytokines in anal fistulas might have implications for future treatment modalities. The objective of the present study was to assess local production of a selected panel of cytokines in anal fistulas, including pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). Fistula tract tissue was obtained from 27 patients with a transsphincteric fistula of cryptoglandular origin who underwent flap repair, ligation of the intersphincteric fistula tract or a combination of both procedures. Patients with a rectovaginal fistula or a fistula due to Crohn's disease were excluded. Frozen tissue samples were sectioned and stained using advanced immuno-enzyme staining methods for detection of selected cytokines, IL-1β, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-17A, IL-18, IL-36 and TNF-α. The presence and frequencies of cytokine-producing cells in samples were quantitated. The key finding was abundant expression of IL-1β in 93 % of the anal fistulas. Frequencies of IL-1β-producing cells were highest (>50 positive stained cells) in 7 % of the anal fistulas. Also, cytokines IL-8, IL-12p40 and TNF-α were present in respectively 70, 33 and 30 % of the anal fistulas. IL-1β is expressed in the large majority of cryptoglandular anal fistulas, as well as several other pro-inflammatory cytokines.",

Objective To elucidate QOL of health states corresponding to different stages of PF associated with CD in Japan. Method This cross-sectional, observational, web-based questionnaire survey assessed eight different health states in patients with CD and PF and individuals without CD (non-patients) from the Medilead Healthcare Panel (MHP) and determined the utility values (QOL scores) in each health state by the time trade-off method. In patients, we determined also the utility value of the current health state associated with CD and the PF. The analysis excluded respondents with logical inconsistencies. Results The analysis included 82 patients and 576 non-patients with the same sex and age distribution as the Japanese population. In both groups, mean utility values were higher in remission (patients, 0.78; non-patients, 0.51) than in non-remission states, with lowest values for poor prognosis after proctectomy (patients, 0.13; non-patients, −0.10) and highest values for the state with mild symptoms (patients, 0.60; non-patients, 0.30). In patients, the mean utility value of the current health state was 0.71. Conclusion QOL decreases with increasing severity of PF and is lower for good prognosis after proctostomy than for remission.",

      "doi": "",
      "abstract": "Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is now regarded as the gold standard for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, PET imaging can be prohibitive in terms of cost and planning, and is also among the imaging techniques with the highest dosage of radiation. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), in contrast, is more widely available and provides more flexibility when setting the desired image resolution. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of AD using MRI is difficult due to the very subtle physiological differences between healthy and AD subjects visible on MRI. As a result, many attempts have been made to synthesize PET images from MR images using generative adversarial networks (GANs) in the interest of enabling the diagnosis of AD from MR. Existing work on PET synthesis from MRI has largely focused on Conditional GANs, where MR images are used to generate PET images and subsequently used for AD diagnosis. There is no end-to-end training goal. This paper proposes an alternative approach to the aforementioned, where AD diagnosis is incorporated in the GAN training objective to achieve the best AD classification performance. Different GAN lossesare fine-tuned based on the discriminator performance, and the overall training is stabilized. The proposed network architecture and training regime show state-of-the-art performance for three- and four- class AD classification tasks.",

      "abstract": "We consider high-dimensional regression over subgroups of observations. Our work is motivated by biomedical problems, where disease subtypes, for example, may differ with respect to underlying regression models, but sample sizes at the subgroup-level may be limited. We focus on the case in which subgroup-specific models may be expected to be similar but not necessarily identical. Our approach is to treat subgroups as related problem instances and jointly estimate subgroup-specific regression coefficients. This is done in a penalized framework, combining an $\\ell_1$ term with an additional term that penalizes differences between subgroup-specific coefficients. This gives solutions that are globally sparse but that allow information-sharing between the subgroups. We present algorithms for estimation and empirical results on simulated data and using Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and cancer datasets. These examples demonstrate the gains our approach can offer in terms of prediction and the ability to estimate subgroup-specific sparsity patterns.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is one of the most concerned neurodegenerative diseases. In the last decade, studies on AD diagnosis attached great significance to artificial intelligence (AI)-based diagnostic algorithms. Among the diverse modality imaging data, T1-weighted MRI and 18F-FDGPET are widely researched for this task. In this paper, we propose a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) to fuse the multi-modality information including T1-MRI and FDG-PDT images around the hippocampal area for the diagnosis of AD. Different from the traditional machine learning algorithms, this method does not require manually extracted features, and utilizes the stateof-art 3D image-processing CNNs to learn features for the diagnosis and prognosis of AD. To validate the performance of the proposed network, we trained the classifier with paired T1-MRI and FDG-PET images using the ADNI datasets, including 731 Normal (NL) subjects, 647 AD subjects, 441 stable MCI (sMCI) subjects and 326 progressive MCI (pMCI) subjects. We obtained the maximal accuracies of 90.10% for NL/AD task, 87.46% for NL/pMCI task, and 76.90% for sMCI/pMCI task. The proposed framework yields comparative results against state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, the experimental results have demonstrated that (1) segmentation is not a prerequisite by using CNN, (2) the hippocampal area provides enough information to give a reference to AD diagnosis.

      "doi": "",
      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prominent, worldwide, age-related neurodegenerative disease that currently has no systemic treatment. Strong evidence suggests that permeable amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) oligomers, astrogliosis and reactive astrocytosis cause neuronal damage in AD. A large amount of Abeta is secreted by astrocytes, which contributes to the total Abeta deposition in the brain. This suggests that astrocytes may also play a role in AD, leading to increased attention to their dynamics and associated mechanisms. Therefore, in the present study, we developed and evaluated novel stochastic models for Abeta growth using ADNI data to predict the effect of astrocytes on AD progression in a clinical trial. In the AD case, accurate prediction is required for a successful clinical treatment plan. Given that AD studies are observational in nature and involve routine patient visits, stochastic models provide a suitable framework for modelling AD. Using the approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach, the AD etiology may be modelled as a multi-state disease process. As a result, we use this approach to examine the weak and strong influence of astrocytes at multiple disease progression stages using ADNI data from the baseline to 2-year visits for AD patients whose ages ranged from 50 to 90 years. Based on ADNI data, we discovered that the strong astrocyte effect (i.e., a higher concentration of astrocytes as compared to Abeta) could help to lower or clear the growth of Abeta, which is a key to slowing down AD progression.",

Patient and public involvement is essential for aligning research with patient priorities. This study aimed to gather patient perspectives on the use of MRI in pfCD.<h4>Methods</h4>A mixed-methods approach was used, following Guidance for Reporting Involvement of Patients and the Public (GRIPP2) guidelines. An online survey, co-developed with a patient representative, included open and closed questions on MRI experiences, advantages, challenges, and the potential for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated reports. This was followed by a virtual session for further exploration of patient views. Thematic analysis was conducted on the data.<h4>Results</h4>Forty-seven patients with Crohn's disease (37 with pfCD) from 6 countries participated, with 28/37 (76%) completing the survey. Key themes included patient expectations for MRI, preferences for scan intervals, and report content. Most (93%) wanted MRI reports to compare with previous scans, highlighting fistula changes and new abscesses. A majority (57%) preferred MRI scans annually when well, and more frequently after surgery (64.3% preferred scans at 3 months). Emotional relief was associated with MRI improvements, though access to services and report clarity remained challenging. Interest in AI-generated reports was expressed if clearly explained and validated by professionals.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This is the first study exploring patient views on MRI use in pfCD, emphasizing the need for patient-centred MRI reporting and clearer communication. Future work should enhance patient access and validate AI-generated MRI reports.",

To evaluate the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes for the treatment of refractory perianal fistulas. Nonrandomized, nonblinded single-center phase II clinical trial. Tertiary university hospital. Twenty-three patients were enrolled, 20 of whom completed the study. Refractory perianal fistula was defined as resistance to at least 1 course of treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor-α therapy. After clinical assessment and MRI, the patients received general anesthesia, and 5 mL of exosome solution was injected directly into the fistula tracts. The injections were repeated 3 times at 2-month intervals, and patients were followed monthly for 6 months after the last injection. Tissue samples from the tracts were obtained before each injection and subjected to immunohistopathological assessment. MRI data were obtained before and 6 months after the last injection. The primary outcome of this study was fistula tract closure on clinical examination and MRI. The secondary outcome was an improvement in the discharge from the tracts. Fistula tracts were fully closed in 12 patients (60%). Four patients showed clinical improvement, with some tracts remaining open, and 4 patients were completely resistant to treatment.

ANTECEDENTES:Las fístulas perianales de la enfermedad de Crohn a menudo son resistentes a las terapias anti-TNF-α estándares. Los exosomas derivados de células madre mesenquimales (MSC) son vesículas extracelulares que tienen efectos antiinflamatorios muy potentes, y la fase anterior de este estudio demostró su seguridad en el tratamiento de fístulas perianales refractarias.OBJETIVO:Evaluar la eficacia de los exosomas derivados de MSC para el tratamiento de fístulas perianales refractarias.DISEÑO:Ensayo clínico de fase II, no aleatorizado y no ciego, unicéntrico.LUGARES:Hospital universitario terciario.PACIENTES:Se inscribieron veintitrés pacientes, 20 de los cuales completaron el estudio. La fístula perianal refractaria se definió como la resistencia a al menos un ciclo de tratamiento con terapia anti-TNF-α.INTERVENCIONES:Después de la evaluación clínica y la resonancia magnética, los pacientes fueron sometidos a anestesia general y se inyectaron 5 ml de solución de exosoma directamente en los trayectos de la fístula. Las inyecciones se repitieron tres veces a intervalos de 2 meses y los pacientes fueron seguidos mensualmente durante 6 meses después de la última inyección. Se obtuvieron muestras de tejido de los tractos antes de cada inyección y se sometieron a evaluación inmunohistopatológica. Los datos de imágenes de resonancia magnética se obtuvieron antes y seis meses después de la última inyección.PRINCIPALES MEDIDAS DE RESULTADO:El resultado primario de este estudio fue el cierre del trayecto de la fístula en el examen clínico y la imagen de resonancia magnética. El resultado secundario fue una mejora en la descarga de los tractos.RESULTADOS:Los trayectos de la fístula se cerraron completamente en 12 (60%) de los pacientes. Cuatro pacientes mostraron mejoría clínica, algunos tractos permanecieron abiertos y cuatro pacientes fueron completamente resistentes al tratamiento. Durante el ensayo se trataron un total de 43 trayectos fistulosos, 30 (69,7%) de los cuales mostraron un cierre completo. El análisis histopatológico reveló reducciones sustanciales en la inflamación local y signos de una mayor regeneración tisular. El análisis inmunohistoquímico del grupo de diferenciación 68, 20 y 31 reafirmó estos resultados.CONCLUSIONES:Los exosomas derivados de MSC son seguros y eficaces para el tratamiento de fístulas perianales refractarias en pacientes con enfermedad de Crohn.

      "abstract": "The semantic segmentation of pelvic organs via MRI has important clinical significance. Recently, deep learning-enabled semantic segmentation has facilitated the three-dimensional geometric reconstruction of pelvic floor organs, providing clinicians with accurate and intuitive diagnostic results. However, the task of labeling pelvic floor MRI segmentation, typically performed by clinicians, is labor-intensive and costly, leading to a scarcity of labels. Insufficient segmentation labels limit the precise segmentation and reconstruction of pelvic floor organs. To address these issues, we propose a semi-supervised framework for pelvic organ segmentation. The implementation of this framework comprises two stages. In the first stage, it performs self-supervised pre-training using image restoration tasks. Subsequently, fine-tuning of the self-supervised model is performed, using labeled data to train the segmentation model. In the second stage, the self-supervised segmentation model is used to generate pseudo labels for unlabeled data. Ultimately, both labeled and unlabeled data are utilized in semi-supervised training. Upon evaluation, our method significantly enhances the performance in the semantic segmentation and geometric reconstruction of pelvic organs, Dice coefficient can increase by 2.65% averagely. Especially for organs that are difficult to segment, such as the uterus, the accuracy of semantic segmentation can be improved by up to 3.70%.",

Overall, results show that while current methods are imperfect, they have major utility for research and clinical applications.

Performance is particularly strong for clinical pathogenic variants, including some difficult-to-diagnose cases, and extends to interpretation of cancer-related variants.

      "abstract": "Results of the first comprehensive light pollution survey in Hong Kong are presented. The night-sky brightness was measured and monitored around the city using a portable light sensing device called the Sky Quality Meter over a 15-month period beginning in March 2008. A total of 1,957 data sets were taken at 199 distinct locations, including urban and rural sites covering all 18 Administrative Districts of Hong Kong. The survey shows that the environmental light pollution problem in Hong Kong is severe - the urban night-skies (sky brightness at 15.0 mag per arcsec square) are on average ~100 times brighter than at the darkest rural sites (20.1 mag per arcsec square), indicating that the high lighting densities in the densely populated residential and commercial areas lead to light pollution. In the worst polluted urban location studied, the night-sky at 13.2 mag per arcsec square can be over 500 times brighter than the darkest sites in Hong Kong. The observed night-sky brightness is found to be affected by human factors such as land utilization and population density of the observation sites, together with meteorological and/or environmental factors. Moreover, earlier night-skies (at 9:30pm local time) are generally brighter than later time (at 11:30pm), which can be attributed to some public and commercial lightings being turned off later at night.

In this study, the second to fifth convolution blocks of the visual geometric group network were applied to extract the depth features in the way of transfer learning, and a multimode feature fusion algorithm was constructed. The whole network was trained by maximizing the energy proportion of the feature layers, which was compared with the fully convolutional neural network (FCN) algorithm. Then, this algorithm was adopted to the imaging diagnosis of 50 patients with anorectal diseases admitted to our hospital, and it was found that the similarity coefficient (85.37%), accuracy (80.02%), and recall rate (79.38%) of the improved deep learning algorithm were higher markedly than those of the FCN algorithm (70.18%, 67.82%, and 66.92%) (P < 0.05). As the number of convolutional layers increased, the segmentation accuracy of the convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm was also improved. The detection rate of the observation group (84%) rose hugely compared with the control group (64%), and the difference was statistically obvious (P < 0.05). Besides, the detection accuracy of abscess location (84%), impotent tract location (80%), and internal orifice location (92%) in patients from the observation group was higher substantially than the accuracy of abscess location (60%), impotent tract location (68%), and internal orifice location (72%) from the control group (P < 0.05).

      "abstract": "AbstractIn this paper, we present a deep learning method, DDMReg, for accurate registration between diffusion MRI (dMRI) datasets. In dMRI registration, the goal is to spatially align brain anatomical structures while ensuring that local fiber orientations remain consistent with the underlying white matter fiber tract anatomy. DDMReg is a novel method that uses joint whole-brain and tract-specific information for dMRI registration. Based on the successful VoxelMorph framework for image registration, we propose a novel registration architecture that leverages not only whole brain information but also tract-specific fiber orientation information. DDMReg is an unsupervised method for deformable registration between pairs of dMRI datasets: it does not require nonlinearly pre-registered training data or the corresponding deformation fields as ground truth. We perform comparisons with four state-of-the-art registration methods on multiple independently acquired datasets from different populations (including teenagers, young and elderly adults) and different imaging protocols and scanners. We evaluate the registration performance by assessing the ability to align anatomically corresponding brain structures and ensure fiber spatial agreement between different subjects after registration. Experimental results show that DDMReg obtains significantly improved registration performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Importantly, we demonstrate successful generalization of DDMReg to dMRI data from different populations with varying ages and acquired using different acquisition protocols and different scanners.",

The resultant evidential models can quantify fine-grained uncertainty using the learned evidence. To ensure theoretically sound evidential models, the evidence needs to be non-negative, which requires special activation functions for model training and inference. This constraint often leads to inferior predictive performance compared to standard softmax models, making it challenging to extend them to many large-scale datasets. To unveil the real cause of this undesired behavior, we theoretically investigate evidential models and identify a fundamental limitation that explains the inferior performance: existing evidential activation functions create zero evidence regions, which prevent the model to learn from training samples falling into such regions. A deeper analysis of evidential activation functions based on our theoretical underpinning inspires the design of a novel regularizer that effectively alleviates this fundamental limitation. Extensive experiments over many challenging real-world datasets and settings confirm our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.",

By a judicious combination of theoretical arguments and empirical observations, we find suitable network architectures and training hyperparameters that result in robust and efficient neural network approximations of the parameters to observable map. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate low prediction errors for the trained network networks, even when the network has been trained with a few samples, at a computational cost which is several orders of magnitude lower than the underlying PDE solver.   Moreover, we combine the proposed deep learning algorithm with Monte Carlo (MC) and Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods to efficiently compute uncertainty propagation for nonlinear PDEs. Under the assumption that the underlying neural networks generalize well, we prove that the deep learning MC and QMC algorithms are guaranteed to be faster than the baseline (quasi-) Monte Carlo methods.

Recent work, however, has shown that deep learning models can be used to automatically learn feature representations directly from the raw, unstructured bytes of the binaries themselves. In this paper, we explore what these models are learning about malware. To do so, we examine the learned features at multiple levels of resolution, from individual byte embeddings to end-to-end analysis of the model. At each step, we connect these byte-oriented activations to their original semantics through parsing and disassembly of the binary to arrive at human-understandable features. Through our results, we identify several interesting features learned by the model and their connection to manually-derived features typically used by traditional machine learning models. Additionally, we explore the impact of training data volume and regularization on the quality of the learned features and the efficacy of the classifiers, revealing the somewhat paradoxical insight that better generalization does not necessarily result in better performance for byte-based malware classifiers.",

An estimation of the likelihood of successful recanalization can support treatment decision-making. In this study, we proposed a fully automated prediction of a patient's recanalization score using pre-treatment CT and CTA imaging. We designed a spatial cross attention network (SCANet) that utilizes vision transformers to localize to pertinent slices and brain regions.

In this work, we proposed a new training data-independent framework, called Deep Contextual Features Learning (DeepCFL), to perform image synthesis and image restoration based on the semantics of the input image. The contextual features are simply the high dimensional vectors representing the semantics of the given image. DeepCFL is a single image GAN framework that learns the distribution of the context vectors from the input image.

      "abstract": "The recent advances in deep learning (DL) have been accelerated by access to large-scale data and compute. These large-scale resources have been used to train progressively larger models which are resource intensive in terms of compute, data, energy, and carbon emissions. These costs are becoming a new type of entry barrier to researchers and practitioners with limited access to resources at such scale, particularly in the Global South. In this work, we take a comprehensive look at the landscape of existing DL models for medical image analysis tasks and demonstrate their usefulness in settings where resources are limited. To account for the resource consumption of DL models, we introduce a novel measure to estimate the performance per resource unit, which we call the PePR score. Using a diverse family of 131 unique DL architectures (spanning 1M to 130M trainable parameters) and three medical image datasets, we capture trends about the performance-resource trade-offs. In applications like medical image analysis, we argue that small-scale, specialized models are better than striving for large-scale models. Furthermore, we show that using existing pretrained models that are fine-tuned on new data can significantly reduce the computational resources and data required compared to training models from scratch. We hope this work will encourage the community to focus on improving AI equity by developing methods and models with smaller resource footprints.",

      "abstract": "Gastrointestinal Tuberculosis (GITB) and Crohn's disease (CD) are both chronic granulomatous diseases with a predilection to involve primarily the terminal ileum. GITB is often considered a disease of the developing world, while CD and inflammatory bowel disease are considered a disease of the developed world. But in recent times, the epidemiology of both diseases has changed. Differentiating GITB from CD is of immense clinical importance as the management of both diseases differs. While GITB needs anti-tubercular therapy (ATT), CD needs immunosuppressive therapy. Misdiagnosis or a delay in diagnosis can lead to catastrophic consequences. Most of the clinical features, endoscopic findings, and imaging features are not pathognomonic for either of these two conditions. The definitive diagnosis of GITB can be clinched only in a fraction of cases with microbiological positivity (acid-fast bacilli, mycobacterial culture, or PCR-based tests). In most cases, the diagnosis is often based on consistent clinical, endoscopic, imaging, and histological findings. Similarly, no single finding can conclusively diagnose CD. Multiparametric-based predictive models incorporating clinical, endoscopy findings, histology, radiology, and serology have been used to differentiate GITB from CD with varied results. However, it is limited by the lack of validation studies for most such models. Many patients, especially in TB endemic regions, are initiated on a trial of ATT to see for an objective response to therapy. Early mucosal response assessed at two months is an objective marker of response to ATT. Prolonged ATT in CD is recognized to have a fibrotic effect. Therefore, early discrimination may be vital in preventing the delay in the diagnosis of CD and avoiding a complicated course.",

However, the additional burden of perianal fistula on patients with only Crohn’s disease remains to be addressed. This patient-reported survey considered outcomes of two domains: “diagnosis” (eg, symptoms) and “living with the disease” (eg, quality of life, well-being, and relationships). Methods Patients with perianal fistula and Crohn’s disease completed an online, self-selective, anonymous, 46-item survey available in 11 languages hosted on the European Federation of Crohn’s & Ulcerative Colitis Associations and national patient association websites. The survey was conducted between July and December 2019 in Europe and other regions. Likert scales and closed questions were used to assess outcomes. Results Of the 820 respondents with Crohn’s disease (67.2% women; median age, 40.0 years), 532 (64.9%) reported the presence of perianal fistula. Patients with perianal fistula reported a greater impact on overall quality of life (P < .001), well-being (P < .001), relationships (P < .001), social life (P = .001), and work life (P = .012) than patients with only Crohn’s disease. Conclusions Perianal fistulas impact several domains of the life of patients with Crohn’s disease. These results may help healthcare practitioners plan therapeutic strategies that address the symptomatic and psychological burden experienced by patients with perianal fistulizing Crohn’s disease.",

      "abstract": "Background Treating complex perianal fistulas in Crohn’s disease patients remains a challenge. Classical surgical treatments for Crohn’s disease fistulas have been extrapolated from cryptoglandular fistulas treatment, which have different etiology, and this might interfere with its effectiveness, in addition, they increase fecal incontinence risk. Recently, new surgical techniques with support from biological approaches, like stem cells, have been developed to preserve the function of the sphincter. We have performed a systematic literature review to compare the results of these different techniques in the treatment of Crohn’s or Cryptoglandular fistula. Methods PubMed, EMBASE, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched systematically for relevant articles. We included randomized controlled trials and observational studies that referred to humans, were written in English, included adults 18+ years old, and were published during the 10-year period from 2/01/2010 to 2/29/2020. Evidence level was assigned as designated by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. Results Of the 577 citations screened, a total of 79 were ultimately included in our review. In Crohn’s disease patients, classical techniques such as primarily seton, Ligation of Intersphincteric Fistula Tracks, or lay open, healing rates were approximately 50–60%, while in cryptoglandular fistula were around, 70–80% for setons or flaps. In Crohn’s disease patients, new surgical techniques using derivatives of adipose tissue reported healing rates exceeding 70%, stem cells-treated patients achieved higher combined remission versus controls (56.3% vs 38.6%, p = 0.010), mesenchymal cells reported a healing rate of 80% at week 12. In patients with cryptoglandular fistulas, a healing rate of 70% using derivatives of adipose tissue or platelets was achieved, and a healing rate of 80% was achieved using laser technology. Fecal incontinence was improved after the use of autologous platelet growth factors and Nitinol Clips. Conclusion New surgical techniques showed better healing rates in Crohn’s disease patients than classical techniques, which have better results in cryptoglandular fistula than in Crohn’s disease. Healing rates for complex cryptoglandular fistulas were similar between the classic and new techniques, being the new techniques less invasive; the incontinence rate improved with the current techniques.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Accurately predicting the risk of clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula after pancreatoduodenectomy before surgery may assist surgeons in making more informed treatment decisions and improved patient counselling. The aim was to evaluate the predictive accuracy of a radiomics-based preoperative-Fistula Risk Score (RAD-FRS) for clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula. Methods Radiomic features were derived from preoperative CT scans from adult patients after pancreatoduodenectomy at a single centre in the Netherlands (Amsterdam, 2013–2018) to develop the radiomics-based preoperative-Fistula Risk Score. Extracted radiomic features were analysed with four machine learning classifiers. The model was externally validated in a single centre in Italy (Verona, 2020–2021). The radiomics-based preoperative-Fistula Risk Score was compared with the Fistula Risk Score and the updated alternative Fistula Risk Score. Results Overall, 359 patients underwent a pancreatoduodenectomy, of whom 89 (25 per cent) developed a clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula. The radiomics-based preoperative-Fistula Risk Score model was developed using CT scans of 118 patients, of which three radiomic features were included in the random forest model, and externally validated in 57 patients. The model performed well with an area under the curve of 0.90 (95 per cent c.i. 0.71 to 0.99) and 0.81 (95 per cent c.i. 0.69 to 0.92) in the Amsterdam test set and Verona data set respectively. The radiomics-based preoperative-Fistula Risk Score performed similarly to the Fistula Risk Score (area under the curve 0.79) and updated alternative Fistula Risk Score (area under the curve 0.79). Conclusion The radiomics-based preoperative-Fistula Risk Score, which uses only preoperative CT features, is a new and promising radiomics-based score that has the potential to be integrated with hospital CT report systems and improve patient counselling before surgery.

Perianal abscesses and anal fistulas are two sequential phases of the same anorectal infectious process. We experienced a case of FAMC which developed 3 years after the treatment of a perianal abscess. Case presentation A 68-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of progressive anal pain and a palpable tumor. She had a history of undergoing a drainage operation for a perianal abscess 3 years previously. A 15 × 15-mm tumor at the former drainage site was identified; transanal ultrasonography showed an intersphincteric fistula connecting to the tumor. A biopsy taken from the tumor demonstrated mucinous adenocarcinoma; the tumor was diagnosed as FAMC. Laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection was performed. Histopathology showed highly dysplastic cells lining the lumen of the anal fistula and poorly differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma proliferating in the dermis and epidermis in the distal aspect of the fistula. Conclusions FAMC can develop within fewer than 3 years after the development of a perianal abscess and anal fistula.",

In previous phase 2/3 studies, ustekinumab (UST) showed some evidence of efficacy on fistula resolution, with no clear dose-response relationship. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the role of UST in perianal fistula treatment. Here, we report fistula data from two recent studies of UST in CD, SEAVUE and STARDUST.\n \n \n \n In SEAVUE, biologic-naïve pts with moderate-to-severe CD were randomized to receive blinded UST (⁓6mg/kg IV at baseline then 90mg SC q8w) or adalimumab (ADA; 160/80mg SC at baseline/W2, then 40mg SC q2w). In STARDUST, biologic-naïve and biologic-failure pts with moderate-to-severe CD received open-label UST ⁓6mg/kg IV at baseline and UST 90mg SC at W8. At W16, pts were randomized to maintenance treatment under standard of care (90mg SC q12w or q8w) or treat-to-target (90mg SC q12w or q8w with potential adjustment to q4w) regimens. In both trials, the number of open and draining perianal fistulas was evaluated at baseline and the end of maintenance (SEAVUE W52, STARDUST W48). Fistula resolution was defined as closure of all fistulas. Pts with missing data at W52/W48 were considered to not have been in fistula resolution. In SEAVUE, pts who had a prohibited CD-related surgery, discontinued for lack of efficacy or an adverse event of worsening CD, or had prohibited concomitant medication changes before W52 were considered not to be in fistula resolution.\n \n \n \n In SEAVUE, 7 of 13 pts (53.8%) with active perianal fistulas at baseline in the UST group had complete fistula resolution at W52, and 6 of 16 patients (37.5%) in the ADA group had fistula resolution. In STARDUST, 9 of 19 pts (47.4%) with active perianal fistulas at baseline had complete fistula resolution at W48. Of the 9 pts in fistula resolution, 2 were receiving q12w at W48, 6 were receiving q8w, and 1 was receiving q4w. Of the 10 pts without fistula resolution, 2 were receiving q12w at W48, 3 were receiving q8w, 1 was receiving q4w and 4 discontinued before W48. In both studies, among pts with evaluable samples for pharmacokinetic analysis, fistula closure at W52/48 was not associated with higher serum drug concentrations at either the early time point of W16 or at the end of maintenance (Figure). This result was consistent for UST in both studies as well as ADA in SEAVUE.\n \n \n \n \n \n Of pts with perianal fistulas at baseline in SEAVUE and STARDUST who received UST (32 pts in total), half were in fistula resolution after ~1 year of maintenance treatment. No relationship was observed between fistula resolution and serum drug concentrations, but no definite conclusions can be drawn given the relatively small sample size.\n",

      "abstract": "Background Perianal fistula is a considered as chronic recurrent inflammatory condition that requires proper surgical treatment and may require repeated intervention. Therefore, adequate pre-operative radiological diagnosis plays a critical role. In this study, we aimed at comparing the role of endoanal ultrasonography with MRI fistulography in evaluating the primary fistula's tract, internal opening, secondary extensions, and complications of the perianal fistula. Results The study was carried over 108 males (90%) and 12 females (10%) presenting with clinically diagnosed perianal fistula. Ultrasound was found superior to MRI in the localization of the internal opening with estimated K value (0.44), P value (0.001). Regarding the type of fistula, ultrasound was found in agreement with MRI in 112 cases (93.3%) with estimated K value of about (0.7). Ultrasound was found equally effective as MRI in the detection of complication with estimated agreement K value of about 1. Regarding assessment of the secondary extensions, the agreement between the two modalities was about 50% with estimated k value of about 0.65. Conversely, MRI was found superior to ultrasound in the characterization of the fibrotic tracts. Conclusions Both EAUS and MRI have a crucial role in the evaluation and detection of perianal fistulas. EAUS was preferable to MRI in the localization of the internal opening; ,conversely, in the evaluation of extra-sphincteric fistulas and fibrotic tracts characterization MRI was preferable to EAUS.",

A fistula is typically defined as a pathological communication between two epithelialized surfaces. More specifically, perianal fistula manifests as an abnormal tract between the anorectal canal and the perianal skin. Perianal fistulas are often characterized by significantly decreased patient quality of life. The cryptoglandular theory of perianal fistulas suggests their development from the proctodeal glands, which originate from the intersphincteric plane and perforate the internal sphincter with their ducts. Involvement of proctodeal glands in the inflammatory process could play a primary role in the formation of cryptoglandular perianal fistula. The objective of this narrative review was to investigate the current knowledge of the pathogenesis of cryptoglandular perianal fistula with the specific aims of characterizing the potential role of proinflammatory factors responsible for the development of chronic inflammation.

      "abstract": "Background Perianal fistulas are a challenging manifestation of Crohn’s disease. Best medical and surgical therapy results in only about a third of patients remaining in remission at one year on maintenance treatment and sustained healing is often elusive. There is little published data on patient perspective of living with the condition or coping strategies in the face of non-curative/non-definitive treatment. We aimed to understand the experience of living with perianal fistula(s) and their impact on quality of life and routine functioning. Methods This exploratory qualitative study used purposive sampling to recruit participants with current / previous diagnosis of Crohn’s anal fistulas, from national IBD / bowel disease charities. The “standards for reporting qualitative research” (SRQR) recommendations were followed. Unstructured individual face-to-face interviews were audio recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically. Early themes were reviewed by the study team including patient advocates, clinicians and qualitative researchers. Results Twelve interviews were conducted, achieving apparent data saturation. Three broad themes were uncovered: Burden of symptoms ; Burden of treatment ; and Impact on emotional, physical and social well-being . Each included several sub-themes, with considerable interplay between these. The impact of perianal fistula(s) on patients with CD is intense and wide reaching, negatively affecting intimate, close and social relationships. Fistulas cause losses in life and work-related opportunities, and treatments can be difficult to tolerate. Conclusion Crohn’s perianal fistulas exert a heavy negative physical and emotional impact on patients. These findings will inform development of a patient reported outcome measure to assess treatment effectiveness and quality of life for patients living with this challenging condition.",

      "abstract": "Multiparametric radiological imaging is vital for detection, characterization and diagnosis of many different diseases. The use of radiomics for quantitative extraction of textural features from radiological imaging is increasing moving towards clinical decision support. However, current methods in radiomics are limited to using single images for the extraction of these textural features and may limit the applicable scope of radiomics in different clinical settings. Thus, in the current form, they are not capable of capturing the true underlying tissue characteristics in high dimensional multiparametric imaging space. To overcome this challenge, we have developed a multiparametric imaging radiomic framework termed MPRAD for extraction of radiomic features from high dimensional datasets. MPRAD was tested on two different organs and diseases; breast cancer and cerebrovascular accidents in brain, commonly referred to as stroke. The MPRAD framework classified malignant from benign breast lesions with excellent sensitivity and specificity of 87% and 80.5% respectively with an AUC of 0.88 providing a 9%-28% increase in AUC over single radiomic parameters. More importantly, in breast, the glandular tissue MPRAD were similar between each group with no significance differences. Similarly, the MPRAD features in brain stroke demonstrated increased performance in distinguishing the perfusion-diffusion mismatch compared to single parameter radiomics and there were no differences within the white and gray matter tissue. In conclusion, we have introduced the use of multiparametric radiomics into a clinical setting",

      "abstract": "While lung cancer is the second most diagnosed form of cancer in men and women, a sufficiently early diagnosis can be pivotal in patient survival rates. Imaging-based, or radiomics-driven, detection methods have been developed to aid diagnosticians, but largely rely on hand-crafted features which may not fully encapsulate the differences between cancerous and healthy tissue. Recently, the concept of discovery radiomics was introduced, where custom abstract features are discovered from readily available imaging data. We propose a novel evolutionary deep radiomic sequencer discovery approach based on evolutionary deep intelligence. Motivated by patient privacy concerns and the idea of operational artificial intelligence, the evolutionary deep radiomic sequencer discovery approach organically evolves increasingly more efficient deep radiomic sequencers that produce significantly more compact yet similarly descriptive radiomic sequences over multiple generations. As a result, this framework improves operational efficiency and enables diagnosis to be run locally at the radiologist's computer while maintaining detection accuracy. We evaluated the evolved deep radiomic sequencer (EDRS) discovered via the proposed evolutionary deep radiomic sequencer discovery framework against state-of-the-art radiomics-driven and discovery radiomics methods using clinical lung CT data with pathologically-proven diagnostic data from the LIDC-IDRI dataset. The evolved deep radiomic sequencer shows improved sensitivity (93.42%), specificity (82.39%), and diagnostic accuracy (88.78%) relative to previous radiomics approaches.",

      "abstract": "Treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) represents, in the majority of cases, a real challenge to the gastroenterologist's abilities and skills as well as a clinical test concerning his/her levels of medical knowledge and experience. During the last two decades, our pharmaceutical arsenal was significantly strengthened, especially after the introduction of the so-called biological agents, drugs which to a large extent not only improved the results of conservative treatment but also changed the natural history of the disease. However, colectomy is still necessary for some patients with severe UC although smaller compared to the past, precisely because of the improvements achieved in the available conservative treatment. Nevertheless, surgeries to treat colon dysplasia and cancer are increasing to some extent. At the same time, satisfactory improvements in surgical techniques, the pre-and post-operative care of patients, as well as the selection of the appropriate time for performing the surgery have been noticed. Regarding patients with CD, the improvement of conservative treatment did not significantly change the need for surgical treatment since two-thirds of patients need to undergo surgery at some point in the course of their disease. On the other hand, the outcome of the operation has improved through good preoperative care as well as the wide application of more conservative surgical techniques aimed at keeping as much of the bowel <i>in situ</i> as possible. This article discusses the indications for surgical management of UC patients from the gastroenterologist's point of view, the results of the emerging new techniques such as transanal surgery and robotics, as well as alternative operations to the classic ileo-anal-pouch anastomosis. The author also discusses the basic principles of surgical management of patients with CD based on the results of the relevant literature. The self-evident is emphasized, that is, to achieve an excellent therapeutic result in patients with severe inflammatory bowel disease in today's era; the close cooperation of gastroenterologists with surgeons, pathologists, imaging, and nutritionists is of paramount importance.",

Similarly, imaging via Doppler ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging provide valuable insights but suffer from operator dependence, inconsistent sensitivity, and accessibility constraints. This narrative review summarizes the current state of the art with regard to leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to diagnose and predict outcomes in patients with cirrhosis or portal hypertension as well as to optimize outcomes in patients undergoing TIPS placement for the treatment of these conditions.

      "abstract": "Accurate myocardial scar reconstruction is crucial for understanding arrhythmical risk and guiding treatment strategies in cardiac electrophysiology. Beyond providing anatomical insight, these reconstructions also serve as a foundational input for constructing patient-specific 3D computational models, which are increasingly used to simulate electrical activity and predict therapeutic outcomes. However, traditional interpolation methods struggle with the low inter-slice resolution (typically 8-10 mm) of late gadolinium-enhanced cardiac MRI (LGE-CMR) data, despite the high in-plane resolution (1-2 mm), leading to inaccuracies in the representation of scar morphology. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based interpolation framework that utilizes coordinate-based learning and Monte Carlo Dropout uncertainty estimation to reconstruct myocardial scar regions from sparse LGE-CMR slices. While the underlying methods are established, their application to myocardial scar reconstruction for use in personalized cardiac modeling represents a novel contribution. We evaluate our method on two different left ventricular (LV) models: a pre-clinical pig LV high-resolution (1.2 mm) gold-standard MRI, and a clinical LV with a more complex scar morphology. Our DL framework is trained using 3D anatomical coordinates as input, with a neural network architecture consisting of two hidden layers and dropout layers for uncertainty modeling. To improve consistency between 2D MRI data and 3D LV models, we introduce a custom loss function that enforces spatial and anatomical constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that the DL-based approach significantly outperforms the Log-Odds method in terms of scar segmentation accuracy, volumetric difference, and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). The DL model trained with uncertainty estimation achieves the best performance, with MSE reduced to 0.094, DSC improved to 0.83, and volumetric error minimized to -2.72%. Additionally, uncertainty-aware training enhances the prediction of border zones between healthy and scarred myocardium, where traditional methods exhibit high errors. These findings highlight the effectiveness of deep learning-based interpolation for low-resolution LGE-CMR scar reconstruction, demonstrating its potential for improving patient-specific computational cardiac modeling. By incorporating uncertainty estimation and anatomical constraints, our approach provides a more accurate and clinically meaningful representation of myocardial scar morphology, paving the way for enhanced risk stratification and treatment planning in cardiac electrophysiology.",

      "abstract": "Renal fibrosis is a critical pathological process driving chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Early diagnosis is essential for timely intervention, yet traditional methods like renal biopsy are invasive and present significant limitations. Consequently, noninvasive techniques are gaining attention for renal fibrosis assessment. Biomarkers such as transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) and platelet-derived growth factor D (PDGF-D) have been explored for monitoring fibrosis progression, though their specificity and reliability challenges persist. Emerging imaging techniques, including molecular and functional imaging, offer valuable structural and functional insights but remain limited in detecting early-stage fibrosis. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool to enhance diagnostic accuracy by integrating imaging and biomarker data. Machine learning algorithms applied to ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging have demonstrated improved predictive capabilities for renal fibrosis detection. Furthermore, AI-driven multimodal approaches, combining clinical, imaging, and biomarker data, provide new opportunities for accurate, noninvasive diagnosis and monitoring. Despite these advancements, challenges such as small sample sizes, lack of standardization, and AI model interpretability must be addressed. Future research should focus on refining noninvasive biomarkers, improving imaging techniques, and developing AI-driven models to enhance diagnostic accuracy and clinical applicability in renal fibrosis assessment.

      "abstract": "Sudden cardiac death (SCD) from ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Traditional risk stratification, primarily based on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and other coarse metrics, often fails to identify a large subset of patients at risk and frequently leads to unnecessary device implantations. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer new strategies to improve both long-term SCD risk prediction and near-term VAs forecasting. In this review, we discuss how AI algorithms applied to the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) can identify subtle risk markers in conditions such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), and coronary artery disease (CAD), often outperforming conventional risk models. We also explore the integration of AI with cardiac imaging, such as scar quantification on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and fibrosis mapping, to enhance the identification of the arrhythmogenic substrate. Furthermore, we investigate the application of data from implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) and wearable devices to predict ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) events before they occur, thereby advancing care toward real-time prevention. Amid these innovations, we address the medicolegal and ethical implications of AI-driven automated alerts in arrhythmia care, highlighting when clinicians can trust AI predictions. Future directions include multimodal AI fusion to personalize SCD risk assessment, as well as AI-guided VT ablation planning through imaging-based digital heart models.

Automated two-dimensional and three-dimensional (3D) analysis allows rapid, reproducible assessments of ventricular volumes and EF. In valvular heart disease, AI assists in measurement, procedural planning, and integration with 3D printing. CCT benefits from AI at every workflow stage, from image acquisition to disease assessment.

Algorithms enable rapid segmentation and functional assessment, while ongoing studies support its utility in risk prediction and plaque characterization. In CMR, AI accelerates acquisition, reduces artifacts, and automates segmentation and tissue characterization. Deep learning (DL) models accurately detect fibrosis, scar, and functional parameters, positively influencing prognosis prediction in every cardiac disease. AI-driven tools also streamline report generation, enhance Telemedicine workflow, and guide less experienced users in image acquisition. Despite these advances, challenges remain.

      "abstract": "Cardiovascular ageing is a progressive loss of physiological reserve, modified by environmental and genetic risk factors, that contributes to multi-morbidity due to accumulated damage across diverse cell types, tissues, and organs. Obesity is implicated in premature ageing, but the effect of body fat distribution in humans is unknown. This study determined the influence of sex-dependent fat phenotypes on human cardiovascular ageing. Data from 21 241 participants in the UK Biobank were analysed. Machine learning was used to predict cardiovascular age from 126 image-derived traits of vascular function, cardiac motion, and myocardial fibrosis. An age-delta was calculated as the difference between predicted age and chronological age. The volume and distribution of body fat was assessed from whole-body imaging. The association between fat phenotypes and cardiovascular age-delta was assessed using multivariable linear regression with age and sex as co-covariates, reporting β coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Two-sample Mendelian randomization was used to assess causal associations. Visceral adipose tissue volume [β = 0.656, (95% CI, .537-.775), P < .0001], muscle adipose tissue infiltration [β = 0.183, (95% CI, .122-.244), P = .0003], and liver fat fraction [β = 1.066, (95% CI .835-1.298), P < .0001] were the strongest predictors of increased cardiovascular age-delta for both sexes. Abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue volume [β = 0.432, (95% CI, .269-.596), P < .0001] and android fat mass [β = 0.983, (95% CI, .64-1.326), P < .0001] were each associated with increased age-delta only in males. Genetically predicted gynoid fat showed an association with decreased age-delta. Shared and sex-specific patterns of body fat are associated with both protective and harmful changes in cardiovascular ageing, highlighting adipose tissue distribution and function as a key target for interventions to extend healthy lifespan.",

The SMART system demonstrates LV speckle tracking based on motion vector estimation, refined by structural information using endocardial and epicardial segmentation throughout the cardiac cycle. This approach enables automated measurement of LVM<sub>SMART</sub> and LVGLS<sub>SMART</sub>. The feasibility of SMART is validated in 111 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients (median age: 58 years, 69% male) who underwent TTE and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR). LVGLS<sub>SMART</sub> showed a strong correlation with conventional manual LVGLS measurements (Pearson's correlation coefficient [PCC] 0.851; mean difference 0 [-2-0]). When compared to CMR as the reference standard for LVM, the conventional dimension-based TTE method overestimated LVM (PCC 0.652; mean difference: 106 [90-123]), whereas LVM<sub>SMART</sub> demonstrated excellent agreement with CMR (PCC 0.843; mean difference: 1 [-11-13]). For predicting extensive myocardial fibrosis, LVGLS<sub>SMART</sub> and LVM<sub>SMART</sub> exhibited performance comparable to conventional LVGLS and CMR (AUC: 0.72 and 0.66, respectively). Patients identified as high risk for extensive fibrosis by LVGLS<sub>SMART</sub> and LVM<sub>SMART</sub> had significantly higher rates of adverse outcomes, including heart failure hospitalization, new-onset atrial fibrillation, and defibrillator implantation. The SMART technique provides a comparable LVGLS evaluation and a more accurate LVM assessment than conventional TTE, with predictive values for myocardial fibrosis and adverse outcomes.

      "abstract": "Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) represents a significant, often silently progressing, valvular heart disease with historically suboptimal management due to perceived high surgical risks. Transcatheter tricuspid valve interventions (TTVI) offer a promising, less invasive therapeutic avenue. Central to the success of TTVI is Right Ventricular Reverse Remodelling (RVRR), defined as an improvement in RV structure and function, which strongly correlates with enhanced patient survival. The right ventricle (RV) undergoes complex multi-scale biomechanical maladaptations, progressing from adaptive concentric to maladaptive eccentric hypertrophy, coupled with increased stiffness and fibrosis. Molecular drivers of this pathology include early failure of antioxidant defenses, metabolic shifts towards glycolysis, and dysregulation of microRNAs. Accurate RV function assessment necessitates advanced imaging modalities like 3D echocardiography, Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMR), and Computed Tomography (CT), along with strain analysis. Following TTVI, RVRR typically manifests as a biphasic reduction in RV volume overload, improved myocardial strain, and enhanced RV-pulmonary arterial coupling. Emerging molecular biomarkers alongside advanced imaging-derived biomechanical markers like CT-based 3D-TAPSE and RV longitudinal strain, are proving valuable. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are transforming prognostication by integrating diverse clinical, laboratory, and multi-modal imaging data, enabling unprecedented precision in risk stratification and optimizing TTVI strategies.",

We applied causal tree learning to the DECAAF II trial data as an example of real applications, identifying subgroups that may be superior when subject to one of the treatments over the other through an easily interpretable process. For each subgroup identified, the characteristics were summarized, and the relationship between treatment arms and risk for recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmia (aTA) among subjects was assessed. Causal tree learning demonstrated that, among all the preablation predictors, dividing subgroups according to age, with a cutoff of 58 years, provides the most heterogeneous subgroups in response to fibrosis-guided ablation in addition to pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) compared with PVI alone. The difference in the risk of recurrence of aTA between 2 treatments was nonsignificant in older patients (hazard ratio [HR] 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77-1.47; P = .72). However, among the younger patients, the risk of aTA recurrence was significantly lower in the fibrosis-guided ablation group compared with PVI-only (HR 0.50; 95% CI 0.28-0.90); P = .02).

      "abstract": "Simple Summary Early characterization of the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDHIDH) gene mutation status of glioma is crucial for personalized decision making and prognosis in clinical neurooncological treatment. Based on the known differences in energy metabolism between IDHIDH-mutated and IDHIDH-wildtype gliomas, we assessed physio-metabolic magnetic resonance imaging-based measures along with machine learning for potential reliable presurgical characterization of IDHIDH gene status. Traditional machine learning algorithms and simple deep learning models trained in analyzing physio-metabolic parameters demonstrated the best performance in classifying the IDHIDH gene status of gliomas in independent internal testing. In contrast, external testing revealed that traditional machine learning models trained on clinical MRI data had higher accuracy compared to physio-metabolic algorithms, reflecting differences in data acquisition methodology between the two sites. Our results outline the necessity of independent internal and external testing, thus calling for standardized and robust protocols for clinical MRI-driven AI applications. Abstract The mutational status of the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene plays a key role in the treatment of glioma patients because it is known to affect energy metabolism pathways relevant to glioma. Physio-metabolic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables the non-invasive analysis of oxygen metabolism and tissue hypoxia as well as associated neovascularization and microvascular architecture. However, evaluating such complex neuroimaging data requires computational support. Traditional machine learning algorithms and simple deep learning models were trained with radiomic features from clinical MRI (cMRI) or physio-metabolic MRI data. A total of 215 patients (first center: 166 participants + 16 participants for independent internal testing of the algorithms versus second site: 33 participants for independent external testing) were enrolled using two different physio-metabolic MRI protocols. The algorithms trained with physio-metabolic data demonstrated the best classification performance in independent internal testing: precision, 91.7%; accuracy, 87.5%; area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC), 0.979. In external testing, traditional machine learning models trained with cMRI data exhibited the best IDH classification results: precision, 84.9%; accuracy, 81.8%; and AUROC, 0.879. The poor performance for the physio-metabolic MRI approach appears to be explainable by site-dependent differences in data acquisition methodologies. The physio-metabolic MRI approach potentially supports reliable classification of IDH gene status in the presurgical stage of glioma patients. However, non-standardized protocols limit the level of evidence and underlie the need for a reproducible framework of data acquisition techniques.",

      "abstract": "The liver, a life-sustaining organ, plays a substantial role in many body functions. Liver diseases have become an important world health problem in terms of prevalence, incidences, and mortalities. Liver fibrosis/cirrhosis is great of importance, because if not treated in time liver cancer could be occurred and spread to other parts of the body. For this reason, early diagnosis of liver fibrosis/cirrhosis gives significance. Accordingly, this study investigated the performances of different machine learning algorithms for prediction of liver fibrosis/cirrhosis based on demographic and blood values. In this context, random forest, k nearest neighbour and C4.5 decision tree algorithms were used and these algorithms were implemented on WEKA data mining tool. The obtained results revealed out that random forest algorithm outperformed in term of all evaluation metrics (90.91% accuracy, 90% specificity, 90% precision, 91.8% recall, 0.909 F-measure and 0.962 ROC) as compared with other algorithms.",

      "doi": "10.33140/amlai.02.01.03",
      "abstract": "Software defect prediction is a significant activity in every software firm. It helps in producing quality software by reliable defect prediction, defect elimination, and prediction of modules that are susceptible to defect. Several researchers have proposed different software prediction approaches in the past. However, these conventional software defect predictions are prone to low classification accuracy, time-consuming, and tasking. This paper aims to develop a novel multi-model ensemble machine-learning for software defect prediction. The ensemble technique can reduce inconsistency among training and test datasets and eliminate bias in the training and testing phase of the model, thereby overcoming the downsides that have characterized the existing techniques used for the prediction of a software defect. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes a new ensemble machine-learning model for software defect prediction using k Nearest Neighbour (kNN), Generalized Linear Model with Elastic Net Regularization (GLMNet), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) with Random Forest as base learner. Experiments were conducted using the proposed model on CM1, JM1, KC3, and PC3 datasets from the NASA PROMISE repository using the RStudio simulation tool. The ensemble technique achieved 87.69% for CM1 dataset, 81.11% for JM1 dataset, 90.70% for PC3 dataset, and 94.74% for KC3 dataset. The performance of the proposed system was compared with that of other existing techniques in literature in terms of AUC. The ensemble technique achieved 87%, which is better than the other seven state-of-the-art techniques under consideration. On average, the proposed model achieved an overall prediction accuracy of 88.56% for all datasets used for experiments. The results demonstrated that the ensemble model succeeded in effectively predicting the defects in PROMISE datasets that are notorious for their noisy features and high dimensions. This shows that ensemble machine learning is promising and the future of software defect prediction.",

      "abstract": "Data science has become increasingly essential for the production of official statistics, as it enables the automated collection, processing, and analysis of large amounts of data. With such data science practices in place, it enables more timely, more insightful and more flexible reporting. However, the quality and integrity of data-science-driven statistics rely on the accuracy and reliability of the data sources and the machine learning techniques that support them. In particular, changes in data sources are inevitable to occur and pose significant risks that are crucial to address in the context of machine learning for official statistics.   This paper gives an overview of the main risks, liabilities, and uncertainties associated with changing data sources in the context of machine learning for official statistics. We provide a checklist of the most prevalent origins and causes of changing data sources; not only on a technical level but also regarding ownership, ethics, regulation, and public perception. Next, we highlight the repercussions of changing data sources on statistical reporting. These include technical effects such as concept drift, bias, availability, validity, accuracy and completeness, but also the neutrality and potential discontinuation of the statistical offering. We offer a few important precautionary measures, such as enhancing robustness in both data sourcing and statistical techniques, and thorough monitoring. In doing so, machine learning-based official statistics can maintain integrity, reliability, consistency, and relevance in policy-making, decision-making, and public discourse.",

      "abstract": "Learning curves are a concept from social sciences that has been adopted in the context of machine learning to assess the performance of a learning algorithm with respect to a certain resource, e.g., the number of training examples or the number of training iterations. Learning curves have important applications in several machine learning contexts, most notably in data acquisition, early stopping of model training, and model selection. For instance, learning curves can be used to model the performance of the combination of an algorithm and its hyperparameter configuration, providing insights into their potential suitability at an early stage and often expediting the algorithm selection process. Various learning curve models have been proposed to use learning curves for decision making. Some of these models answer the binary decision question of whether a given algorithm at a certain budget will outperform a certain reference performance, whereas more complex models predict the entire learning curve of an algorithm. We contribute a framework that categorises learning curve approaches using three criteria: the decision-making situation they address, the intrinsic learning curve question they answer and the type of resources they use. We survey papers from the literature and classify them into this framework.",

      "abstract": "Online active learning is a paradigm in machine learning that aims to select the most informative data points to label from a data stream. The problem of minimizing the cost associated with collecting labeled observations has gained a lot of attention in recent years, particularly in real-world applications where data is only available in an unlabeled form. Annotating each observation can be time-consuming and costly, making it difficult to obtain large amounts of labeled data. To overcome this issue, many active learning strategies have been proposed in the last decades, aiming to select the most informative observations for labeling in order to improve the performance of machine learning models. These approaches can be broadly divided into two categories: static pool-based and stream-based active learning. Pool-based active learning involves selecting a subset of observations from a closed pool of unlabeled data, and it has been the focus of many surveys and literature reviews. However, the growing availability of data streams has led to an increase in the number of approaches that focus on online active learning, which involves continuously selecting and labeling observations as they arrive in a stream. This work aims to provide an overview of the most recently proposed approaches for selecting the most informative observations from data streams in real time. We review the various techniques that have been proposed and discuss their strengths and limitations, as well as the challenges and opportunities that exist in this area of research.",

In this contribution, we propose a novel approach to identify relevant features of the input data, inspired by methods from the energy landscapes field, developed in the physical sciences. By identifying conserved weights within groups of minima of the loss landscapes, we can identify the drivers of model decision making. Analogues to this idea exist in the molecular sciences, where coordinate invariants or order parameters are employed to identify critical features of a molecule. However, no such approach exists for machine learning loss landscapes. We will demonstrate the applicability of energy landscape methods to machine learning models and give examples, both synthetic and from the real world, for how these methods can help to make models more interpretable.",

In this research, we conducted a benchmark study to assess the performance of different applicable machine learning approaches on three different datasets where we accumulated the largest and most diversified one. We explored a number of advanced pre-trained language models for fake news detection along with the traditional and deep learning ones and compared their performances from different aspects for the first time to the best of our knowledge. We find that BERT and similar pre-trained models perform the best for fake news detection, especially with very small dataset. Hence, these models are significantly better option for languages with limited electronic contents, i.e., training data. We also carried out several analysis based on the models' performance, article's topic, article's length, and discussed different lessons learned from them.

      "abstract": "This article provides the first survey of computational models of emotion in reinforcement learning (RL) agents. The survey focuses on agent/robot emotions, and mostly ignores human user emotions. Emotions are recognized as functional in decision-making by influencing motivation and action selection. Therefore, computational emotion models are usually grounded in the agent's decision making architecture, of which RL is an important subclass. Studying emotions in RL-based agents is useful for three research fields. For machine learning (ML) researchers, emotion models may improve learning efficiency. For the interactive ML and human-robot interaction (HRI) community, emotions can communicate state and enhance user investment. Lastly, it allows affective modelling (AM) researchers to investigate their emotion theories in a successful AI agent class. This survey provides background on emotion theory and RL. It systematically addresses 1) from what underlying dimensions (e.g., homeostasis, appraisal) emotions can be derived and how these can be modelled in RL-agents, 2) what types of emotions have been derived from these dimensions, and 3) how these emotions may either influence the learning efficiency of the agent or be useful as social signals. We also systematically compare evaluation criteria, and draw connections to important RL sub-domains like (intrinsic) motivation and model-based RL. In short, this survey provides both a practical overview for engineers wanting to implement emotions in their RL agents, and identifies challenges and directions for future emotion-RL research.",

Methods: This paper presents the first complete method for automatically explaining results for any machine learning predictive model without degrading accuracy. We did a computer coding implementation of the method. Using the electronic medical record data set from the Practice Fusion diabetes classification competition containing patient records from all 50 states in the United States, we demonstrated the method on predicting type 2 diabetes diagnosis within the next year. Results: For the champion machine learning model of the competition, our method explained prediction results for 87.4% of patients who were correctly predicted by the model to have type 2 diabetes diagnosis within the next year.

This review provides a critical synthesis of recent evidence in AI-driven imaging, digital histopathology, predictive modeling using electronic health records (EHR), and wearable-based phenotyping. We compare and analyze the strengths and limitations of landmark AI models, highlight real-world implementation barriers such as algorithmic bias and data privacy, and explore emerging paradigms such as federated learning and multimodal integration. While AI tools consistently outperform conventional scores (e.g., Model for End-Stage Liver Disease [MELD]) in predictive accuracy, their clinical adoption remains limited by regulatory, ethical, and validation challenges.

The global epidemiological situation of liver diseases is grave, posing a substantial threat to human health and quality of life. Characterized by high incidence and mortality rates, liver diseases have emerged as a prominent global public health concern. In recent years, the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning, and radiomics has transformed medical research and clinical practice, demonstrating considerable potential in hepatology. AI is capable of automatically detecting abnormal cells in liver tissue sections, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of pathological diagnosis. Deep learning models are able to extract features from computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging images to facilitate liver disease classification.

This review aims to explore the current progress in integrating radiomics with multi-omics data-genomics and transcriptomics-to establish biologically grounded, multidimensional models for precision management of breast cancer. We will review recent advances in integrative radiomics and radiogenomics, highlight the synergy between imaging and molecular profiling, and discuss emerging machine learning methodologies that facilitate the integration of high-dimensional data. Applications of radiogenomics, including breast cancer subtype and molecular mutation prediction, radiogenomic mapping of the tumour immune microenvironment, and response forecasting to immunotherapy and targeted therapies, as well as lymph nodes involvement, will be evaluated.

However, interpreting IUS images is challenging for physicians due to the time-intensive process of identifying markers indicative of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study aims for fully automating the analysis of pediatric IBD to distinguish between abnormal and normal cases. We used data set of 260 pediatric patients, consisting of 4565 IUS images with 1478 abnormal and 3087 normal cases. Meticulous annotation of the region between the lumen/mucosa and the muscularis/serosa interfaces in a subset of 612 images were performed. An artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm was trained to delineate the region between these interfaces. The boundaries of these regions were extracted, and the average bowel wall thickness (BWT) was calculated and analyzed using cutoff values ranging between 1.5 and 3 mm. This study showed promising segmentation performance in accurately identifying the lumen/mucosa and muscularis/serosa interfaces. In a separate test set of 3953 images, the classification performance at the 2mm BWT cutoff showed the highest sensitivity of 90.29% and a specificity of 93.70%. The AI method showed strong agreement, with an interclass correlation of 0.942 (95% CI: 0.938-0.946), compared to manual clinical measurements. This study demonstrates an AI approach to automate the analysis of pediatric IBD IUS images, providing a reliable tool for early detection, precise characterization, and monitoring of the disease.",

Emerging indications include noninvasive assessment for mucosal healing (both in the small bowel and the colon) and detection of postoperative recurrence in patients with CD. Given the increasing adoption, several CE scoring systems have been specifically developed for IBD. The greatest concern with performing CE, particularly in CD, is capsule retention, but this can be overcome by performing cross-sectional imaging such as magnetic resonance enterography and using patency capsules before performing the procedure.

One hundred and five Crohn's disease patients (52 male, 53 female, 16-68 years old, mean age 34 years old) recruited from two sites underwent MRE, including a 20 second breath-hold cine motility sequence. Each subject completed a Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) symptom questionnaire. Five features within normally appearing bowel were scored visually by two experienced radiologists, and then quantified using automated analysis software, including (1) mean motility, (2) spatial motility variation, (3) temporal motility variation, (4) area of motile bowel, (5) intestinal distension. Multivariable linear regression derived the combination of features with the highest association with HBI score. The best automated metric combination was temporal variation (p<0.05) plus area of motile bowel (p<0.05), achieving an R<sup>2 adjusted</sup> value of 0.036. Spatial variation was also associated with symptoms (p<0.05, R<sup>2 adjusted</sup> = 0.034); however, when visually assessed by radiologists, none of the features had a significant relationship with the HBI score. Software quantified temporal and spatial variability in bowel motility are associated with abdominal symptoms in Crohn's disease. Subjective radiologist assessment of bowel motility is insufficient to detect aberrant motility. Automated analysis of motility patterns holds promise as an objective biomarker for aberrant physiology underlying symptoms in enteric disorders.",

We propose to use nonrigid image registration for automated motility analysis. Registration is particularly difficult when localized intensity changes occur (e.g., due to intraluminal flow or through-plane motion). Therefore, displacements were extracted using a joint registration and modeling of intensity changes. Results were analyzed in 10 patients with known or suspected Crohn's disease. Bowel wall displacements were assessed by tracking bowel cross-sectional markers over time. Automated tracking with the proposed technique was in good agreement with manual tracking (similar bias, improved standard deviations). The ability to quantify different grades of bowel motility was investigated by comparing direct motion measures (i.e., changes in bowel cross-sectional diameter or area) and various parametric maps, e.g., based on the Jacobian of the measured displacements with expert grading. Among these measures, the standard deviation over time of the Jacobian was the best at predicting grades from 1 (moving normally) to 4 (not moving at all) in 50 bowel regions with normal and pathologically reduced motility, yielding 93% correct classification with a 1-class tolerance (i.e., same score as the expert ± 1).",

      "pmid": null,
      "abstract": "The emergence of clinical data warehouses (CDWs), which contain the medical data of millions of patients, has paved the way for vast data sharing for research. The quality of MRIs gathered in CDWs differs greatly from what is observed in research settings and reflects a certain clinical reality. Consequently, a significant proportion of these images turns out to be unusable due to their poor quality. Given the massive volume of MRIs contained in CDWs, the manual rating of image quality is impossible. Thus, it is necessary to develop an automated solution capable of effectively identifying corrupted images in CDWs. This study presents an innovative transfer learning method for automated quality con- trol of 3D gradient echo T1-weighted brain MRIs within a CDW, leveraging artefact sim- ulation. We first intentionally corrupt images from research datasets by inducing poorer contrast, adding noise and introducing motion artefacts. Subsequently, three artefact- specific models are pre-trained using these corrupted images to detect distinct types of artefacts. Finally, the models are generalised to routine clinical data through a transfer learning technique, utilising 3660 manually annotated images. The overall image quality is inferred from the results of the three models, each designed to detect a specific type of artefact. Our method was validated on an independent test set of 385 3D gradient echo T1-weighted MRIs. Our proposed approach achieved excellent results for the detection of bad quality MRIs, with a balanced accuracy of over 87%, surpassing our previous approach by 3.5 percent points. Additionally, we achieved a satisfactory balanced accuracy of 79% for the detection of moderate quality MRIs, outperforming our previous performance by 5 percent points. Our framework provides a valuable tool for exploiting the potential of MRIs in CDWs.",

      "abstract": "Online Automated Privacy Policy Generators (APPGs) are tools used by app developers to quickly create app privacy policies which are required by privacy regulations to be incorporated to each mobile app. The creation of these tools brings convenience to app developers; however, the quality of these tools puts developers and stakeholders at legal risk. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to assess the quality of online APPGs. We analyze the completeness of privacy policies, determine what categories and items should be covered in a complete privacy policy, and conduct APPG assessment with boilerplate apps. The results of assessment show that due to the lack of static or dynamic analysis of app's behavior, developers may encounter two types of issues caused by APPGs. First, the generated policies could be incomplete because they do not cover all the essential items required by a privacy policy. Second, some generated privacy policies contain unnecessary personal information collection or arbitrary commitments inconsistent with user input. Ultimately, the defects of APPGs may potentially lead to serious legal issues. We hope that the results and insights developed in this paper can motivate the healthy and ethical development of APPGs towards generating a more complete, accurate, and robust privacy policy.",

      "abstract": "Important decisions that impact human lives, livelihoods, and the natural environment are increasingly being automated. Delegating tasks to so-called automated decision-making systems (ADMS) can improve efficiency and enable new solutions. However, these benefits are coupled with ethical challenges. For example, ADMS may produce discriminatory outcomes, violate individual privacy, and undermine human self-determination. New governance mechanisms are thus needed that help organisations design and deploy ADMS in ways that are ethical, while enabling society to reap the full economic and social benefits of automation. In this article, we consider the feasibility and efficacy of ethics-based auditing (EBA) as a governance mechanism that allows organisations to validate claims made about their ADMS. Building on previous work, we define EBA as a structured process whereby an entity's present or past behaviour is assessed for consistency with relevant principles or norms. We then offer three contributions to the existing literature. First, we provide a theoretical explanation of how EBA can contribute to good governance by promoting procedural regularity and transparency. Second, we propose seven criteria for how to design and implement EBA procedures successfully. Third, we identify and discuss the conceptual, technical, social, economic, organisational, and institutional constraints associated with EBA. We conclude that EBA should be considered an integral component of multifaced approaches to managing the ethical risks posed by ADMS.",

Fecal calprotectin (FC) and magnetic resonance (MR) enterography are prominent non-invasive methods for assessing disease activity. However, while MR enterography is a valuable diagnostic tool, its high cost and limited accessibility present challenges for widespread use. In contrast, FC is a more affordable and accessible biomarker. To perform a systematic review (SR) examining the correlation between FC levels and MR enterography findings in patients with ileal CD.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic literature search was conducted across the following databases: PubMed, PubMed PMC, BVS-BIREME, SCOPUS, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library, and it was completed in October 2024.<h4>Results</h4>Eight studies were included in this SR. Seven demonstrated a positive correlation between FC levels and MR enterography findings. Additionally, two studies reported significantly lower FC levels in ileal CD than in exclusive colonic or ileocolonic CD cases. The FC cutoff values ranged from >100 to >430 µg/g of feces to determine the activity of the disease.<h4>Conclusions</h4>FC proved to be a reliable biomarker for diagnosing and monitoring CD, demonstrating a positive correlation with findings from MR enterography.",

In this study, we evaluated the value of the parallel encoder network (PE-NET) method for the automated measurement of mesenteric vascular and portal vein parameters and explored the performance of PE-NET combined with support vector machine (SVM) classifier in CD diagnosis.<h4>Methods</h4>The automatic vascular segmentation model was trained using computed tomography enterography (CTE) imaging data from our hospital based on PE-NET. The segmentation performance of the trained model was evaluated using the sensitivity (SEN), the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), and the Average Hausdorff Distance (AHD). Then, the model was used for the automatic measurement of vascular parameters in the classification set, and machine learning classifier SVM was applied based on selected vessel features. The diagnosis performance of the PE-NET + SVM model was evaluated and compared with that of human radiologists and the clinical biomarkers [C-reactive protein (CRP) and fecal calprotectin (FCP)]. The impact of PE-NET + SVM on the reading time of radiologists was also evaluated.<h4>Results</h4>The segmentation dataset included the CTE data from 54 CD patients and 20 healthy controls. The classification dataset included the CTE data from 40 CD patients and 45 healthy controls. We found that PE-NET performed well in the vascular segmentation of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), portal vein (PV), and abdominal aorta (AA) in both validation sets and the testing set. Vascular parameters were automatically extracted by PE-NET. We found that the mesenteric artery, portal vein, abdominal aorta, and the ratio of portal vein to superior mesenteric artery or abdominal aorta were increased in the testing set, with no statistical difference between the automatic measurement obtained using PE-NET and the manual evaluation of CTE. Moreover, an support vector machine (SVM) classifier was applied for CD diagnosis based on the vascular parameters. The F1 scores indicated the comparable diagnostic ability of PE-NET + SVM to senior radiologists with over 10 years of experience, and the receiver operating curves (ROCs) revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) of PE-NET + SVM was 0.934, which was higher than those of clinical biomarkers such as FCP (AUC of 0.913) and CRP (AUC of 0.893), suggesting the great potential of PE-NET in aiding CD diagnosis. Additionally, the reading time of a junior radiologist on CTE images was significantly reduced and comparable to that of a senior radiologist with the help of PE-NET.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The PE-NET enables the automated measurement of mesenteric vascular and portal vein parameters and potentially assists the efficient diagnosis of CD.",

By alleviating the workload of medical staff, AI addresses challenges such as increasing diagnostic demands, workforce shortages, and reliance on subjective interpretation. This review examines the role of AI in reducing diagnostic workload and enhancing efficiency across medical fields from January 2019 to February 2024, identifying limitations and areas for improvement. A comprehensive PubMed search using the keywords \"artificial intelligence\" or \"AI,\" \"efficiency\" or \"workload,\" and \"patient\" or \"clinical\" identified 2587 articles, of which 51 were reviewed. These studies analyzed the impact of AI on radiology, pathology, and other specialties, focusing on efficiency, accuracy, and workload reduction. The final 51 articles were categorized into 4 groups based on diagnostic efficiency, where category A included studies with supporting material provided, category B consisted of those with reduced data volume, category C focused on independent AI diagnosis, and category D included studies that reported data reduction without changes in diagnostic time. In radiology and pathology, which require skilled techniques and large-scale data processing, AI improved accuracy and reduced diagnostic time by approximately 90% or more. Radiology, in particular, showed a high proportion of category C studies, as digitized data and standardized protocols facilitated independent AI diagnoses. AI has significant potential to optimize workload management, improve diagnostic efficiency, and enhance accuracy. However, challenges remain in standardizing applications and addressing ethical concerns. Integrating AI into healthcare workforce planning is essential for fostering collaboration between technology and clinicians, ultimately improving patient care.",

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown differences in brain function between patients with CD and healthy controls (HC). This study aimed to compare the neural correlates of anxiety inindividuals with CD relative to HC, using resting-state fMRI data.<h4>Methods</h4>Participants filled in the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), a validated tool for measuring anxiety, and underwent an MRI acquisition, including both structural and functional sequences, to identify brain regions associated with anxiety scores.<h4>Results</h4>Seventeen patients with CD and eighteen HC matched for age, education, and sex participated in the study. No significant group differences emerged in the STAI scores. However, resting-state fMRI analysis revealed distinct patterns of functional connectivity associated with anxiety scores for the two study groups. Among CD group, greater STAI scores correlated with increased functional connectivity, whereas, in HC, they correlated with decreased functional connectivity. Significant clusters were found in brain regions belonging to specific resting-state networks (RSNs): (a) Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC, within the Default Mode Network), (b) left Middle Frontal Gyrus (within the Left Fronto-Parietal Network), and (c) PCC and right Superior Temporal Gyrus (within the Dorsal Attention Network).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The differential association between functional connectivity and STAI scores observed for CD and HC participants was located in areas within self-referential (Default Mode Network) and cognitive (Left Fronto-Parietal Network and Dorsal Attention Network) RSNs.

This study quantified body composition and physical function alongside proton magnetic resonance imaging (1H MRI) and spectroscopy (31P MRS) measures of organ structure and function in quiescent Crohn's disease patients (CD) and healthy volunteers (HVs), to identify a physiological basis for IBD fatigue.<h4>Methods</h4>Body composition was determined using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and 1H MRI. Knee extensor isometric strength and isokinetic fatigue were measured using dynamometry. 1H MRI was used to quantify cardiac output, cerebral blood flow (gmCBF), and brain oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) at rest, and during supine, steady-state exercise, and recovery. 31P MRS was used to quantify post-exercise muscle phosphocreatine (PCr) resynthesis.<h4>Results</h4>Sixteen CD and 12 HV (age, sex, and BMI matched) were recruited. Fatigue perception was greater (13.9 ± 1 vs 8.3 ± 0.9, P = .001), and daily step count was less (5482 ± 684 vs 8168 ± 1123, P = .04) in CD. During steady-state exercise, gmCBF was less in CD (653 ± 30 vs 823 ± 40 mL/min, P = .003). Cardiac output and brain OEF were no different. Post-exercise PCr resynthesis was less in CD (17.2 ± 2.0 vs 25.3 ± 2.4 mM·min-1, P = .02). Body composition, isometric strength, and isokinetic fatigability were no different.<h4>Conclusions</h4>CD self-reported increased fatigue perception and exhibited a slower rate of post-exercise PCr resynthesis compared to HV. This occurred independently of changes in body composition, muscle strength, and fatigability. IBD fatigue may be linked to peripheral muscle deconditioning and lower gmCBF during submaximal exercise.",

      "abstract": "Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the spine and sacroiliac joints. This review discusses recent advances across multiple scientific fields that promise to transform axSpA management. Traditionally, axSpA was considered an immune-mediated disease driven by human leukocyte antigen B27 (HLA-B27), interleukin (IL)-23/IL-17 signaling, biomechanics, and dysbiosis. Diagnosis relies on clinical features, laboratory tests, and imaging, particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) nowadays. Management includes exercise, lifestyle changes, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and if this is not sufficient to achieve disease control also biological and targeted-synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. Beyond long-recognized genetic risks like HLA-B27, high-throughput sequencing has revealed intricate gene-environment interactions influencing dysbiosis, immune dysfunction, and aberrant bone remodeling. Elucidating these mechanisms promises screening approaches to enable early intervention. Advanced imaging is revolutionizing the assessment of axSpA's hallmark: sacroiliac bone-marrow edema indicating inflammation. Novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques sensitively quantify disease activity, while machine learning automates complex analysis to improve diagnostic accuracy and monitoring. Hybrid imaging like synthetic MRI/computed tomography (CT) visualizes structural damage with new clarity. Meanwhile, microbiome analysis has uncovered gut ecosystem alterations that may initiate joint inflammation through HLA-B27 misfolding or immune subversion. Correcting dysbiosis represents an enticing treatment target. Moving forward, emerging techniques must augment patient care. Incorporating patient perspectives will be key to ensure innovations like genetics, microbiome, and imaging biomarkers translate into improved mobility, reduced pain, and increased quality of life. By integrating cutting-edge, multidisciplinary science with patients' lived experience, researchers can unlock the full potential of new technologies to deliver transformative outcomes. The future is bright for precision diagnosis, tightly controlled treatment, and even prevention of axSpA.",

      "abstract": "Nitric oxide, synthesised by three isoforms of Nitric Oxide synthases viz., nNOS by neurons, eNOS by endothelial cells and iNOS by phagocytes, performs a wide variety of biological functions in neurons, vascular endothelial cells and immune cells. Interaction between inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and Nitric oxide synthase interacting protein (NOSIP) was observed both in human monocytes and mouse macrophages and in cell free systems by biophysical methods. A novel mutation in nitric oxide synthase interacting protein (NOSIP) determined NO levels produced by human monocytes and was associated with disease severity in Sepsis patients. The study reveals NOSIP as an important regulator of inflammation by virtue of its ability to influence nitric oxide production both in mice and in humans and opens up novel avenues for therapeutic strategies against acute inflammation. While the influence of this novel NOSIP polymorphism in cardio-vascular and neuronal functions could be a subject of future investigations, its role in determining disease severity and mortality of the ongoing Covid 19 pandemic will be of immediate relevance.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundNumerous successful therapies developed for human medicine involve animal experimentation. Animal studies that are focused solely on translational potential, may not sufficiently document unexpected outcomes. Considerable amounts of data from such studies could be used to advance veterinary science. For example, sheep are increasingly being used as models of intensive care and therefore, data arising from such models must be published. In this study, the hypothesis is that there is little information describing cardiorespiratory physiological data from sheep models of intensive care and the author aimed to analyse such data to provide biological information that is currently not available for sheep that received extracorporeal life support (ECLS) following acute smoke-induced lung injury.\n\nMethodsNineteen mechanically ventilated adult ewes undergoing intensive care during evaluation of a form of ECLS (treatment) for acute lung injury were used to collate clinical observations. Eight sheep were injured by acute smoke inhalation prior to treatment (injured/treated), while another eight were not injured but treated (uninjured/treated). Two sheep were injured but not treated (injured/untreated), while one received room air instead of smoke as the injury and was not treated (placebo/untreated). The data were then analysed for 11 physiological categories and compared between the two treated groups.\n\nResultsCompared with the baseline, treatment contributed to and exacerbated the deterioration of pulmonary pathology by reducing lung compliance and the arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio. The oxygen extraction index changes mirrored those of the PaO2/FiO2 ratio. Decreasing coronary perfusion pressure predicted the severity of cardiopulmonary injury.\n\nConclusionsThese novel observations could help in understanding similar pathology such as that which occurs in animal victims of smoke inhalation from house or bush fires, aspiration pneumonia secondary to tick paralysis and in the management of the severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans.",

      "doi": "10.1101/062083",
      "abstract": "Alternative reproductive tactics and strategies (ARTS) refer to polymorphic reproductive behaviours in which in addition to the usual two sexes, there are one or more alternative morphs, usually male, that have evolved the ability to circumvent direct intra-sexual competition. Each morph has its own morphological, ecological, developmental, behavioural, life-history, and physiological profile that shifts the balance between reproduction and self-maintenance, one aspect being immunity. Immunoecological work on species with ARTS, which is the topic of this review, is particularly interesting because the alternative morphs make it possible to separate the effects of sex, per se, from other factors that in other species are inextricably linked with sex. We first summarize the evolution, development and maintenance of ARTS. We then review immunoecological hypotheses relevant to species with ARTS, dividing them into physiological, life-history, and ecological hypotheses. In context of these hypotheses, we critically review in detail all immunoecological studies we could find on species with ARTS. Several interesting patterns emerge. Oddly, there is a paucity of studies on insects, despite the many benefits that arise from working with insects: larger sample sizes, simple immune systems, and countless forms of alternative reproductive strategies and tactics. Of all the hypotheses considered, the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis has generated the greatest amount of work, but not necessarily the greatest level of understanding. Unfortunately, it is often used as a general guiding principle rather than a source of explicitly articulated predictions. Other hypotheses are usually considered a posteriori, but it is perhaps time that they take centre stage. Whereas blanket concepts such as \"immunocompetence\" and \"androgens\" might useful to develop a rationale, predictions need to be far more explicitly articulated. Integration so far has been a one-way street, with ecologists delving deeper into physiology, seemingly at the cost of ignoring their organisms evolutionary history and ecology. One possible useful framework is to divide ecological and evolutionary factors affecting immunity into those that stimulate the immune system, and those that depress it. Finally, the contributions of genomics to ecology are being increasingly recognized, including in species with ARTS, but we must ensure that evolutionary and ecological hypotheses drive the effort, as there is no grandeur in the strict reductionist view of life.",

Pathogens experience selection on traits at multiple scales, including replication rates within host individuals and transmissibility between hosts. We analyze a stochastic model linking pathogen growth and competition within individuals to transmission between individuals. Our analysis reveals a new factor, the cross-scale reproductive number of a mutant virion, that quantifies how quickly mutant strains increase in frequency when they initially appear in the infected host population. This cross-scale reproductive number combines with viral mutation rates, single-strain reproductive numbers, and transmission bottleneck width to determine the likelihood of evolutionary emergence, and whether evolution occurs swiftly or gradually within chains of transmission. We find that wider transmission bottlenecks facilitate emergence of pathogens with short-term infections, but hinder emergence of pathogens exhibiting cross-scale selective conflict and long-term infections. Our results provide a framework to advance the integration of laboratory, clinical and field data in the context of evolutionary theory, laying the foundation for a new generation of evidence-based risk assessment of emergence threats.",

      "abstract": "Functional Connectivity (FC) during resting-state or task conditions is not fixed but inherently dynamic. Yet, there is no consensus on whether fluctuations in FC may resemble isolated transitions between discrete FC states rather than continuous changes. This quarrel hampers advancing the study of dynamic FC. This is unfortunate as the structure of fluctuations in FC can certainly provide more information about developmental changes, aging, and progression of pathologies. We merge the two perspectives and consider dynamic FC as an ongoing network reconfiguration, including a stochastic exploration of the space of possible steady FC states. The statistical properties of this random walk deviate both from a purely \"order-driven\" dynamics, in which the mean FC is preserved, and from a purely \"randomness-driven\" scenario, in which fluctuations of FC remain uncorrelated over time. Instead, dynamic FC has a complex structure endowed with long-range sequential correlations that give rise to transient slowing and acceleration epochs in the continuous flow of reconfiguration. Our analysis for fMRI data in healthy elderly revealed that dynamic FC tends to slow down and becomes less complex as well as more random with increasing age. These effects appear to be strongly associated with age-related changes in behavioural and cognitive performance.\n\nHighlightsO_LIDynamic Functional Connectivity (dFC) at rest and during cognitive task performs a \"complex\" (anomalous) random walk.\nC_LIO_LISpeed of dFC slows down with aging.\nC_LIO_LIResting dFC replaces complexity by randomness with aging.\nC_LIO_LITask performance correlates with the speed and complexity of dFC.\nC_LI",

Although automation and other high-throughput techniques have led to an abundance of data enabling data-driven quantitative modeling and parameter estimation, the intense amount of simulation needed for these methods still frequently results in a computational bottleneck. Here we present bioscrape (Bio-circuit Stochastic Single-cell Reaction Analysis and Parameter Estimation) - a Python package for fast and flexible modeling and simulation of highly customizable chemical reaction networks. Specifically, bioscrape supports deterministic and stochastic simulations, which can incorporate delay, cell growth, and cell division. All functionalities - reaction models, simulation algorithms, cell growth models, partioning models, and Bayesian inference - are implemented as interfaces in an easily extensible and modular object-oriented framework. Models can be constructed via Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) or specified programmatically via a Python API. Simulation run times obtained with the package are comparable to those obtained using C code - this is particularly advantageous for computationally expensive applications such as Bayesian inference or simulation of cell lineages. We first show the packages simulation capabilities on a variety of example simulations of stochastic gene expression. We then further demonstrate the package by using it to do parameter inference on a model of integrase enzyme-mediated DNA recombination dynamics with experimental data.

      "doi": "10.1101/092619",
      "abstract": "Part 1Development and calibration of suitably accurate functional assays for BRCA1 RING domain and BRCT domain missense substitutions could dramatically accelerate clinical classification of rare missense substitutions observed in that gene. Leveraging data from 68,000 full sequence tests of BRCA1 and BRCA2, plus data from the limited number of already classified BRCA1 RING domain missense substitutions, we used logistic regression and related techniques to evaluate three BRCA1 RING domain assays. These were recently described high throughput yeast 2-hybrid and E3 ubiquitin ligase assays, plus a newly developed mammalian 2-hybrid assay. While there were concerns about the accuracy of the yeast 2-hybrid assay and the indirect nature of the ubiquitin ligase assay, the mammalian 2-hybrid assay had excellent correlation with existing missense substitution classifications. After calibration, this assay contributed to classification of one newly reported BRCA1 missense substitution. In principal, the mammalian 2-hybrid assay could be converted to a high-throughput format that would likely retain suitable accuracy.\n\nPart 2How does one achieve clinically applicable classification of the vast majority of all possible sequence variants in disease susceptibility genes? BRCA1 is a high-risk susceptibility gene for breast and ovarian cancer. Pathogenic protein truncating variants are scattered across the open reading frame, but all known missense substitutions that are pathogenic because of missense dysfunction are located in either the amino-terminal RING domain or the carboxy-terminal BRCT domain. Heterodimerization of the BRCA1 and BARD1 RING domains is a molecularly defined obligate activity. Hence, we tested every BRCA1 RING domain missense substitution that can be created by a single nucleotide change for heterodimerization with BARD1 in a Mammalian 2-hybrid (M2H) assay. Downstream of the M2H laboratory assay, we addressed three additional challenges: assay calibration, validation thereof, and integration of the calibrated results with other available data such as computational evidence and patient/population observational data to achieve clinically applicable classification. Overall, we found that about 20% of BRCA1 RING domain missense substitutions are pathogenic. Using a Bayesian point system for data integration and variant classification, we achieved clinical classification of about 89% of observed missense substitutions. Moreover, among missense substitutions not present in the human observational data used here, we find an additional 47 with concordant computational and functional assay evidence in favor of pathogenicity; these are particularly likely to be classified as Likely Pathogenic once human observational data become available.",

      "abstract": "Individual-based models (IBMs) informing public health policy should be calibrated to data and provide estimates of uncertainty. Two main components of model-calibration methods are the parameter-search strategy and the goodness-of-fit (GOF) measure; many options exist for each of these. This review provides an overview of calibration methods used in IBMs modelling infectious disease spread.\n\nWe identified articles on PubMed employing simulation-based methods to calibrate IBMs informing public health policy in HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria epidemiology published between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2018. Articles were included if models stored individual-specific information, and calibration involved comparing model output to population-level targets. We extracted information on parameter-search strategies, GOF measures, and model validation.\n\nThe PubMed search identified 653 candidate articles, of which 84 met the review criteria. Of the included articles, 40 (48%) combined a quantitative GOF measure with an algorithmic parameter-search strategy - either an optimisation algorithm (14/40) or a sampling algorithm (26/40). These 40 articles varied widely in their choices of parameter-search strategies and GOF measures. For the remaining 44 (52%) articles, the parameter-search strategy could either not be identified (32/44) or was described as an informal, non-reproducible method (12/44). Of these 44 articles, the majority (25/44) were unclear about the GOF measure used; of the rest, only five quantitatively evaluated GOF. Only a minority of the included articles, 14 (17%) provided a rationale for their choice of model-calibration method. Model validation was reported in 31 (37%) articles.\n\nReporting on calibration methods is far from optimal in epidemiological modelling studies of HIV, malaria and TB transmission dynamics. The adoption of better documented, algorithmic calibration methods could improve both reproducibility and the quality of inference in model-based epidemiology. There is a need for research comparing the performance of calibration methods to inform decisions about the parameter-search strategies and GOF measures.\n\nAuthor summaryCalibration - that is, \"fitting\" the model to data - is a crucial part of using mathematical models to better forecast and control the population-level spread of infectious diseases. Evidence that the mathematical model is well-calibrated improves confidence that the model provides a realistic picture of the consequences of health policy decisions. To make informed decisions, Policymakers need information about uncertainty: i.e., what is the range of likely outcomes (rather than just a single prediction). Thus, modellers should also strive to provide accurate measurements of uncertainty, both for their model parameters and for their predictions. This systematic review provides an overview of the methods used to calibrate individual-based models (IBMs) of the spread of HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis. We found that less than half of the reviewed articles used reproducible, non-subjective calibration methods. For the remaining articles, the method could either not be identified or was described as an informal, non-reproducible method. Only one-third of the articles obtained estimates of parameter uncertainty. We conclude that the adoption of better-documented, algorithmic calibration methods could improve both reproducibility and the quality of inference in model-based epidemiology.",

In our clinical analysis of 2678 patients, splicing factor mutations showed inferior relapse-free and overall survival, however, these mutations did not represent independent prognostic markers. RNA-sequencing of 246 and independent validation in 177 patients revealed an isoform expression profile highly characteristic for each individual mutation, with several isoforms showing a strong dysregulation. By establishing a custom differential splice junction usage pipeline we accurately detected aberrant splicing in splicing factor mutated samples. Mutated samples were characterized predominantly by decreased junction usage. A large proportion of differentially used junctions were novel. Targets of splicing dysregulation included several genes with a known role in leukaemia. In SRSF2(P95H) mutants we further explored the possibility of a cascading effect through the dysregulation of the splicing pathway. We conclude that splicing factor mutations do not represent independent prognostic markers. However, they do have genome-wide consequences on gene splicing leading to dysregulated isoform expression of several genes.",

Previous studies investigated specific pathways moderated by glucocorticoids, for example, visual-temporal pathways; however, these analyses were limited to a-priori selected regions. Here, we performed whole-brain pattern analysis to localize phobic stimulus decoding related to the fear-reducing effect of glucocorticoids. We reanalyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from a previously published study with spider-phobic patients and healthy controls. The patients received either glucocorticoids or a placebo treatment before the exposure to spider images. There was moderate evidence that patients with phobia had higher decoding of phobic content in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the left and right anterior insula compared to controls. Decoding in the ACC and the right insula showed strong evidence for correlation with experienced fear. Patients with cortisol reported a reduction of fear by 10-13%; however, there was only weak evidence for changes in neural decoding compared to placebo which was found in the precuneus, the opercular cortex, and the left cerebellum.",

In addition to distinguishing one nucleobase from another, some transcription factors can distinguish between unmodified and modified bases. Current models of transcription factor binding tend not take DNA modifications into account, while the recent few that do often have limitations. This makes a comprehensive and accurate profiling of transcription factor affinities difficult.\n\nHere, we developed methods to identify transcription factor binding sites in modified DNA. Our models expand the standard A/C/G/T DNA alphabet to include cytosine modifications. We developed Cytomod to create modified genomic sequences and enhanced the Multiple EM for Motif Elicitation (MEME) Suite by adding the capacity to handle custom alphabets. We adapted the well-established position weight matrix (PWM) model of transcription factor binding affinity to this expanded DNA alphabet.\n\nUsing these methods, we identified modification-sensitive transcription factor binding motifs. We confirmed established binding preferences, such as the preference of ZFP57 and C/EBP{beta} for methylated motifs and the preference of c-Myc for unmethylated E-box motifs. Using known binding preferences to tune model parameters, we discovered novel modified motifs for a wide array of transcription factors. Finally, we validated predicted binding preferences of OCT4 using cleavage under targets and release using nuclease (CUT&RUN) experiments across conventional, methylation-, and hydroxymethylation-enriched sequences. Our approach readily extends to other DNA modifications.

      "abstract": "Protein-RNA interactions (PRIs) are essential for many biological processes, so understanding aspects of the sequences and structures involved in PRIs is important for unraveling such processes. Because of the expensive and time-consuming techniques required for experimental determination of complex protein-RNA structures, various computational methods have been developed to predict PRIs. However, most of these methods focus on predicting only RNA-binding regions in proteins or only protein-binding motifs in RNA. Methods for predicting entire residue-base contacts in PRIs have not yet achieved sufficient accuracy. Furthermore, some of these methods require the identification of 3D structures or homologous sequences, which are not available for all protein and RNA sequences. Here, we propose a prediction method for predicting residue-base contacts between proteins and RNAs using only sequence information and structural information predicted from sequences. The method can be applied to any protein-RNA pair, even when rich information such as its 3D structure, is not available. In this method, residue-base contact prediction is formalized as an integer programming problem. We predict a residue-base contact map that maximizes a scoring function based on sequence-based features such as k-mers of sequences and the predicted secondary structure. The scoring function is trained using a max-margin framework from known PRIs with 3D structures. To verify our method, we conducted several computational experiments. The results suggest that our method, which is based on only sequence information, is comparable with RNA-binding residue prediction methods based on known binding data.",

      "abstract": "In response to recent advancements in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) management, the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) Clinical Services and Standards Committee (CSSC) has commissioned the BSG IBD section to update its guidelines, last revised in 2019. These updated guidelines aim to complement the IBD standards and promote the use of the national primary care diagnostic pathway for lower gastrointestinal symptoms to enhance diagnostic accuracy and timeliness. Formulated through a systematic and transparent process, this document reflects a consensus of best practices based on current evidence. The guideline, while developed primarily for the UK, is structured to support IBD management internationally. It is endorsed by the BSG executive board and CSSC without external commercial funding, with involvement primarily supported through professional roles in public institutions and the National Health Service (NHS). Methodological revisions since the prior guidelines have enhanced rigor in technical review and development, with methodology details published independently following peer review. In developing the recommendations, 89 clinical experts and stakeholders participated in an online survey, identifying primary outcomes, such as clinical and endoscopic remission, as well as adverse event metrics, all stratified by clinically relevant effect sizes. These guidelines are intended to support clinical decision-making but are not prescriptive, recognizing that individual clinical scenarios may warrant tailored approaches. Further research may inform future revisions as new evidence emerges.",

      "abstract": "Anal fistula is a common disease with recurrent inflammation and accumulated exudate. Traditional treatments often fail to effectively eliminate inflammation and ensure adequate drainage, leading to prolonged healing time and a high recurrence rate. Herein, a new class of quaternized molecular brush‐grafted injectable microgel (denoted as GAA@CNT‐g‐PVBTMA) is developed through thermal polymerization and mechanical fragmentation to promote the healing process of anal fistula. Benefiting from the fragmented morphology with a porous structure, the microgel can effectively fill the fistula and facilitate the drainage of exudate. Owing to the electrostatic interactions between the positively charged quaternized carbon nanotube molecular brush (CNT‐g‐PVBTMA) and the negatively charged inflammatory cytokines, GAA@CNT‐g‐PVBTMA microgel exhibits excellent anti‐inflammatory properties with scavenging rates of 92.6% for tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α) and 92.5% for interleukin‐1β (IL‐1β). Rat inflammatory anal fistula model demonstrates that the microgel can effectively reduce inflammation and epithelialization of the fistula, thereby promoting the healing of the anal fistula. By integrating effective filling, adequate drainage, and excellent anti‐inflammatory properties, GAA@CNT‐g‐PVBTMA microgel provides a promising new direction for the treatment of anal fistula.",

      "abstract": "Complex perianal fistulas, challenging to treat and prone to recurrence, often require surgical intervention that may cause fecal incontinence and lower quality of life due to large surgical wounds and potential sphincter damage. Human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (hUC-MSCs) and their exosomes (hUCMSCs-Exo) may promote wound healing. This study assessed the efficacy, mechanisms, and safety of these exosomes in treating complex perianal fistulas in SD rats. We established a rat model, divided rats with fistulas into the control and the exosome groups. We assessed treatment efficacy through ultrasound, clinical observations, and histopathological analysis. We also evaluated the activation of the HIF-1α/TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway via PCR and Western blot and assessed serological markers for HIF-1α and inflammatory indices through ELISA. We analyzed gut microbiota and the systemic metabolic environment via untargeted metabolomics. The hUCMSCs-Exo effectively promoted healing of wound, regulated the immune balance enhanced collagen synthesis and angiogenesis in the perianal fistulas model of rats, and regulated the gut microbiota and metabolomic profiles. Results of PCR and Western blot analyses indicated that the exosomes activated HIF-1α/TGF-β/Smad signaling pathways. To the dosages tested, the 10ug/100ul concentration (medium dose) was found to be the most effective to the treatment of complex perianal fistulas. The hUCMSCs-Exo significantly promoted the healing of wound in perianal fistulas of rats and demonstrated higher safety. The underlying mechanism facilitating the healing process was likely associated with the activation of the HIF-1α/TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway.",

      "abstract": "Perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease (CD) represents a severe phenotype of CD that is associated with significant morbidity and reduction in quality of life. Perianal fistulizing CD is caused by a complex interplay of genetic predisposition, immune dysregulation, gut dysbiosis, and various unknown physiological and mechanical factors. A multidisciplinary approach is hence required for optimal management . A detailed anatomical description and classification of perianal fistula, including comprehensive clinical, endoscopic, and radiological diagnostic workup, is an important prerequisite to treatment. For simple perianal fistulas, use of antibiotics and immunomodulators, with or without fistulotomy, are appropriate measures. The medical management of complex perianal fistula, on the other hand, requires adequate control of infection before initiation of therapy with immunomodulators. In active complex perianal fistula, anti-tumor necrosis factors remain the most accepted therapy, with concomitant use of antibiotics or immunomodulators enhancing the efficacy. For patients refractory to anti-tumor necrosis factors, treatment with anti-integrins, anti-interleukins, and small molecules is being evaluated. Mesenchymal stem cells, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and exclusive enteral nutrition have also been investigated as adjunct therapies. Despite the expansion of the medical armamentarium, a large proportion of the patients require surgical interventions. In this review, we provide an up-to-date overview of the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and medical management of perianal fistulizing CD. A brief overview of the surgical management of perianal fistulizing CD is also provided.",

Vor diesem Hintergrund zeigen Ergebnisse der Stammzelltherapie eine vielversprechende, sphinkterschonende Therapieoption. Insbesondere die allogene mesenchymale Stammzelltherapie (Darvadstrocel) konnte im Rahmen der randomisierten ADMIRE-CD-Studie eine hohe Wirksamkeit bei komplexen Crohn-Fisteln zeigen, die auch in limitierten „Real-World“-Daten reproduziert werden konnte. Die aktuelle Evidenz der allogenen mesenchymalen Stammzellen hat hierbei auch Einzug in internationale Leitlinien erhalten.

      "abstract": "There are a range of sphincter-preserving procedures available to treat anorectal fistula, some of which can be precluded, or rendered more optimal by specific features of fistula anatomy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard modality for assessing anorectal fistula. To maximise clinical utility, the MRI report should accurately describe these clinically relevant features. We aimed to develop a minimum dataset for reporting MRI of anorectal fistula, in order to improve the assessment and management of these patients. A longlist of 70 potential items for the minimum dataset was generated through systematic review of the literature. This longlist was presented to radiologists, surgeons and gastroenterologists in an online survey to understand the features that shape current clinical practice. The longlist and survey results were then presented to an expert consensus panel to generate the final minimum dataset through discussion and anonymous voting. The final minimum dataset details the general characteristics, features of the internal and external openings, path of the fistula through the sphincters and any associated extensions and collections that should be described in all MRI reports for anal fistula. Additional surgical and perianal Crohn’s disease subsets were developed to indicate the features that aid decision-making for these patients, in addition to a minimum dataset for the clinical request. This study represents a multi-disciplinary approach to developing a minimum dataset for MRI reporting of anal fistula, highlighting the most important features to report that can assist in clinical decision-making. • This paper recommends the minimum features that should be included in all MRI reports for the assessment of anal fistula, including Parks classification, number of tracts, features of the internal and external opening, path of the tract through the sphincters, the presence and features of extensions and collections. • Additional features that aid decision-making for surgery or in the presence of Crohn’s disease have been identified. • The items that should be included when requesting an MRI are specified.",
