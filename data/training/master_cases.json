Its internal opening pierces the anal canal anteriorly near 1 o\u2019clock where a fairly defined restricted collection / abscess formation is seen. The collection measures 1.8 x 1.5 cm. It shows restricted diffusion. Then the thick track protrudes and proceeds to make a hook down anteriorly along the ischioanal fossa for a length of about 9.7 cm. Its external opening being near 3 o'clock. The track has a thick enhanced wall and high signal intensity enhanced content. Case Discussion The description of this fistula is matching with a trans-sphincteric type that represents 25% of perianal fistula . The track of the fistula crosses from the intersphincteric space, through the external sphincter, and then passes into the ischiorectal fossa . It is complicated by abscess formation, resulting in a classification of grade 4 trans-sphincteric fistula.

It runs caudally between the internal and external anal sphincters towards the ischioanal fossa, without the presence of a collection. There is a wrap-around artefact on the \"axial T2 HASTE fat sat\" and \"axial T1 VIBE\" sequences. Case Discussion Perianal fistulas are abnormal communications between the anal canal and the perirectal spaces, which may or may not be associated with a collection. MRI is the preferred study for patients with complex fistulas or to assess and identify anatomical aspects prior to surgical intervention. In this case, we observe a simple grade 3 transsphincteric fistula according to the classification of St James's University Hospital, which crosses two layers of the sphincter complex, meaning it crosses the external anal sphincter and reaches the ischioanal fossa.

Case Discussion Fistulography is a traditional radiological technique used to define the anatomy of perianal fistulas . In fistulography, the external opening is catheterized with a fine cannula, and a water-soluble contrast agent is injected to determine the fistulous tract. Nowadays, MRI is the imaging modality of choice for evaluating the perianal fistula. When MRI is contraindicated, fistulography could be performed, although it is an unreliable technique and is difficult to interpret.

Case presentation A 27-year-old female was admitted to the Third People\u2019s Hospital of Longgang District, Shenzhen, on January 16, 2024, with worsening buttock swelling, pain, and purulent discharge for 6 months, intensifying over the past 2 days. Initially experiencing anal pain 6 months prior, she self-medicated with an unspecified drug for 1 month without relief. Three months ago, the pain extended from the anus to the buttocks, leading to significant swelling and pus discharge, prompting hospital admission. She had not received any surgical treatment before admission. Her body mass index was 20 kg/m\u00b2, and she reported a 2-year history of constipation and hard stools, with bowel movements twice weekly. There was no history of coronary heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, trauma, blood transfusions, or surgeries. She denied smoking, alcohol use, or harmful habits, and there was no family history of genetic diseases. Physical examination upon admission: Body temperature 36.4\u2103; pulse 105 beats per minute; respiration 20 breaths per minute; blood pressure 129/78 mm Hg. The patient was conscious, with a tired mental state, lack of strength and reluctance to speak, and a soft voice. No obvious abnormalities were found in the physical examination of the heart, lungs, and abdomen. Neither the liver nor the spleen was palpable under the costal margin. The hepatic dullness boundary was normal, there was no shifting dullness, and there was no tenderness on percussion of the renal area. Special examination findings: Extensive skin pigmentation, bridged scars, and multiple ulcer openings were observed in the perianal and perineal areas and both buttocks (the lesion area on the left thigh was larger than that on the right). The subcutaneous fistulas were fused and interconnected, and there were a total of 22 ulcer openings. Palpation of the lesions revealed an obvious fluctuating sensation and significant tenderness. When pressed, grayish-red purulent and bloody fluid flowed out from the ulcer openings. The pus was thick and foul-smelling. A cord-like structure extending towards the anus could be felt in the left buttock lesion. The infected area of the entire buttock accounted for approximately 3% of the body surface area. Digital rectal examination: A hard nodule and a cord-like structure leading to and connected with the left buttock lesion area could be felt at the rectal segment at the 3 o\u2019clock position in the lithotomy position, about 5 cm from the anus. There was no tenderness in the anal sinus area at the 3 o\u2019clock position. A cord-like structure could be felt at the 6 o\u2019clock position leading to the anal sinus area at the 9 o\u2019clock position and extending along the skin to the subcutaneous tissue of the right buttock at the 9 o\u2019clock position as shown in Figure 1 A and B.

Associated primary ulcerated lesions of the anal canal were observed in 21 patients (63.6% of cases) and tertiary fibro\u2010stenotic involvement was observed in 7 patients (21.2% of cases). The patients had undergone a mean of 5.3 \u00b1 3.4 proctological surgery procedures and 15 patients (45.6%) had already undergone at least one surgical procedure to close a fistula. Luminal disease location was as follows: 7 patients had ileal lesions (21.2%), 11 had colonic lesions (33.4%), 8 had ileocolonic lesions (24.2%) and 7 (21.2%) had isolated anoperineal lesions. Eight patients (24.2%) had undergone surgery to treat their luminal lesions, including two who had undergone total coloproctectomy with ileoanal anastomosis. None of the patients had a stoma. In terms of luminal disease profile ( n = 26), 9 patients (34.6%) had a non\u2010stricturing, non\u2010penetrating inflammatory profile, 12 (46.2%) had a stricturing profile and 5 (19.2%) had a penetrating profile. Hidradenitis suppurativa was found in 7 patients (21.2%) and extra\u2010intestinal manifestations in 17 patients (51.5%). The most frequent extra\u2010intestinal manifestation was articular signs in 70.6% of cases, followed by skin lesions in 52.9% of cases, hepatic involvement in 11.8% of cases and ocular involvement in 5.9% of cases. All these conditions were confirmed and monitored by specialist physicians. Regarding rheumatological manifestations ( n = 12): 10 patients had peripheral joint involvement 2 patients had axial involvement Regarding dermatological manifestations ( n = 9): 5 patients had psoriasis 1 patient had genital involvement (vulvar erosion and labial oedema) 1 patient had oral aphthosis 1 patient had erythema nodosum 1 patient had pyoderma gangrenosum Regarding hepatic manifestations ( n = 2), both cases were primary sclerosing cholangitis. Regarding ocular manifestations ( n = 1), the patient had uveitis.

The patient presents with persistent perianal symptoms including pain, discharge, and difficulty sitting. Previous surgical history includes examination under anesthesia with seton placement in 2020. The patient has been followed by gastroenterology and colorectal surgery. Current medications include mesalamine, prednisone taper, and ustekinumab 90mg q8 weeks. Allergies include penicillin. Family history significant for IBD in mother.\n\nTECHNIQUE: MRI of the pelvis was performed on a 3T scanner using dedicated phased-array surface coil. Protocol includes axial and coronal T2-weighted sequences, axial T1-weighted pre and post gadolinium sequences, and STIR sequences. Contrast: 15ml of Gadavist was administered intravenously.\n\nCOMPARISON: Prior MRI pelvis dated 2024-06-15.\n\nFINDINGS:\nAnal Canal and Sphincter Complex: The internal and external anal sphincter muscles are identified and show asymmetric signal abnormality. There is focal disruption of the external anal sphincter at the 6 o'clock position.\n\nFistula Assessment: A single transsphincteric fistula tract is identified. The tract originates at the 6 o'clock position at the level of the dentate line, traverses both the internal and external anal sphincter, and extends into the left ischioanal fossa before reaching the perianal skin. The tract measures approximately 4.5 cm in total length. There is moderate T2 hyperintensity within the tract consistent with active inflammation. A seton suture is noted within the tract, appearing as a linear signal void.\n\nCollections: A small rim-enhancing collection measuring 1.2 x 0.8 cm is noted at the external opening in the left perianal region. No other collections are identified.\n\nExtension Assessment: The fistula extends into the ischioanal fossa but there is no supralevator extension. No horseshoe component is identified. No extension to the contralateral side.\n\nRectal Wall: The rectal wall thickness is within normal limits. No mucosal enhancement abnormality. No stricture or mass.\n\nAdditional Findings: Mild prostatic enlargement, benign-appearing. Small amount of physiologic free fluid in the pelvis. No concerning lymphadenopathy. Visualized portions of the bowel appear unremarkable.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Known transsphincteric perianal fistula at 6 o'clock with seton in place. Moderate T2 hyperintensity suggests ongoing active inflammation.\n2. Small perianal collection at external opening, decreased in size compared to prior.\n3. No new fistula tracts.

      "title": "Evidence outside the box: Minimally invasive treatment for anal fistula",
      "clinical_history": "",
      "findings_text": "\n Minimally invasive treatment for anal fistulae represents a paradigm shift in the bid to balance both recurrence prevention and continence preservation. Modern techniques demonstrate high clinical efficacy while preserving function. This is pertinent especially in managing complex fistulae, which typically involve over 30% of the sphincter complex, possess side branches, or contain more than one internal and/or external openings[ Fistula laser closure (FiLaC), video-assisted fistula treatment (VAAFT), and over-the-scope clip (OTSC) are novel surgical approaches that emerged in the last decade at a time when the older, more invasive ligation of inter-sphincteric fistula tract (LIFT) was being increasingly adopted in surgical armamentarium. Grounded in core principles of conventional management, these distinguish themselves by employing modern tools to reduce invasiveness and enable intra-fistula surgery. For instance, VAAFT involves usage of a fistuloscope to directly visualize the fistula in ano (FIA) interior, allowing for endoscopic visualization and closure of the internal fistula opening, in addition to destruction of the pathway. FiLaC and OTSC reinterpret excisional elimination of the tract through usage of radial laser energy for ablation and mechanical sealing of the internal opening, respectively. Regenerative methods are the newest breakthrough in minimally invasive methods, going beyond the surgical principles of traditional fistula management and targeting various pathogeneses of the fistula itself. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), originating from bone marrow or adipose tissue, possess the ability to regenerate themselves and differentiate into multiple lineages. Fistula plugs with acellular extracellular matrices (AEMs) are regenerative biomaterials that include the myriad matrix (often derived from porcine small intestinal submucosa) and ovine forestomach matrix (OFM). Conversely, the GORE BioA Yet, despite the burgeoning plethora of techniques all lauded for minimal invasiveness, clinical consensus regarding which modalities reliably provide the most efficacious and safe outcomes is still evolving. With many newer modalities like stem cell therapy now in later phases of clinical trials and soon entering broader clinical use, it is crucial to make sense of the latest evidence. This present article hence aims to consolidate and review pertinent literature, weigh the pros and cons, and succinctly summarise minimally invasive treatment for anal fistulae. \n The procedure generally has the following principles[ The initial pilot study with 11 patients with cryptoglandular fistulae had an overall success of 81% at 7 months of follow-up[ A retrospective comparative study in 2024 by Uzun  In literature, FiLaC has only been compared to a limited number of alternative procedures, such as fistulotomy with primary sphincteroplasty (FIPS)[ Mainly lauded for continence maintenance and modest detriment to sphincters, FiLaC\u2019s main advantage lies i",

      "findings_text": "\n Fecal incontinence (FI) is a debilitating disorder that significantly affects both physical function and psychological well-being, with a global prevalence of 2%-21% among adults[ In this article, we conducted a comprehensive minireview on the epidemiology, pathophysiological mechanisms, diagnosis, and therapeutic advancements in FI, with a focus on the application and progress of anal sphincter reconstruction. We summarize the efficacy and limitations of traditional surgical approaches and consolidate research progress on emerging treatment options. Through this systematic and integrated strategy, we aim to provide more precise and effective solutions for FI management. FI is clinically defined as the involuntary loss of bowel control, including uncontrolled passage of solid/Liquid stool or flatus[ FI generally arises from the combined influence of multiple pathogenic elements as opposed to a single etiological factor. These factors jointly compromise the structural integrity and functional capacity of the anal sphincter complex. Among women, obstetric trauma represents the predominant etiological factor, with vaginal delivery posing a particular risk. Forceps-assisted deliveries, for example, double the risk of sphincter dysfunction compared with spontaneous vaginal birth due to excessive mechanical stress on the perineal muscles[ In addition to obstetric causes, surgical interventions in the pelvic region, particularly for colorectal, gynecologic, or urologic procedures, may inadvertently cause iatrogenic injury to the anal sphincter. In many cases, these injuries might not be recognized intraoperatively, leading to suboptimal repair and subsequent clinical deterioration[ Local infections, ionizing radiation exposure, and age-associated degenerative alterations independently contribute to progressive sphincter damage. Pelvic infections localized to perineal tissues may trigger gradual inflammatory responses, leading to abscess development and subsequent myonecrosis, with eventual tissue loss or fibrotic scar formation[ The anatomical basis of continence involves precisely coordinated actions of several key structures: The internal anal sphincters (IAS) and external anal sphincters (EAS), the puborectalis muscle, and the intact pelvic floor musculature[ Accurate diagnosis and quantification of anal sphincter injury are critical for devising an effective management plan for patients suffering from FI. Endoanal ultrasound (EAUS) has emerged as the gold standard for the detailed evaluation of anal sphincter integrity[ Comprehensive clinical evaluation forms the cornerstone of diagnostic assessment for FI. Initial patient assessment requires detailed historical analysis to elucidate potential causative factors, encompassing previous obstetric trauma, surgical interventions, and episodes of infection or radiation exposure potentially affecting sphincter integrity.

She also reported severe dysmenorrhea and chronic pelvic pain that had persisted since menarche at age 15. Her menstrual cycles were regular, but intensely painful, and associated with increased perianal bleeding and discomfort. The patient had previously undergone multiple imaging investigations, including ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT), which revealed left renal agenesis and a thick-walled tubular structure in the left adnexa. A provisional diagnosis of a megaureter with ectopic, dysplastic or absent left kidney was made at that time. Four years earlier, she underwent laparoscopic pelvic surgery at a different hospital, but no medical records or operative notes were available. Notably, her perianal symptoms began approximately 2\u20133 months postsurgery and were managed empirically by local practitioners, with no documented work-up or resolution.

The patient was born full-term with normal birth weight and initially appeared healthy. At around 6\u20137 months of life, the patient was referred to the pediatric gastroenterology service due to persistent diarrhea (often with blood), hepatitis, along with poor weight gain and severe perianal dermatitis ( Summary of clinical milestones. On examination at 8 months of life, the infant was determined to be underweight. Initial laboratory tests showed mild anemia and hypoalbuminemia. Inflammatory markers were only modestly elevated despite obvious clinical inflammation. A diagnostic endoscopy was performed at 9.5 months of age that revealed diffuse gastritis, and colonoscopy showed severe pan-colitis with deep ulcerations throughout the colon. Histopathology of the biopsies demonstrated chronic active colitis consistent with IBD. No pathogens were identified on special stains or cultures. A diagnosis of infantile-onset IBD was made (initially categorized as IBD-unclassified due to overlapping Crohn/colitis features). The patient was started on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) as well as corticosteroids to control the acute inflammation. Several courses of high-dose steroids were required during infancy to manage flares of colitis. Once the patient\u2019s condition stabilized, they were transitioned to sulfasalazine (5-aminosalicylic acid) as a maintenance therapy at around 1 year of age. In the United States, sulfasalazine is routinely used as front-line therapy for VEO-IBD to limit steroid exposure even in the absence of extra-intestinal manifestations. However, disease activity remained high: the patient continued to have frequent diarrhea, poor growth, and persistent perianal fistula drainage. Over the course of the next twelve months, the patient experienced multiple colitis flares requiring steroid treatment despite being on sulfasalazine. A repeat endoscopy performed around 2.5y of life confirmed ongoing pancolitis with new inflammation observed in the terminal ileum, indicating the disease had extended. During this time, surgical intervention was required for perianal disease including abscess formation. Given the refractory nature of the patient\u2019s IBD, biologic therapy was attempted. The patient was started on infliximab (anti-TNF monoclonal antibody), initially at standard dosing (5 mg/kg). Due to lack of a clinical response, the dose was quickly escalated to 10 mg/kg and the dosing interval shortened. Despite these adjustments, the patient\u2019s gastrointestinal symptoms did not improve; in fact, the condition worsened, and infliximab was discontinued after two infusions. The patient was then switched to adalimumab (subcutaneous anti-TNF). Similarly, adalimumab failed to induce any remission of their colitis, and it was discontinued after about 6 weeks.

In 2020, he had undergone small bowel resection for \u2013lymphoma. Over a decade earlier, he had anal fistula surgery at an external hospital, where postoperative pathology revealed no abnormalities, and the wound healed well. In 2023, he presented with perianal swelling and pain and was diagnosed with an anal fistula. In 2024, he underwent another surgical procedure at the same hospital; the postoperative wound healed well, and pathology revealed no specific changes. One month prior, the patient developed a mass at the original surgical site, accompanied by pain, discomfort, and minimal fluid discharge. Bowel movements occurred every other day, one to two times each day, with occasional bright red hematochezia. On physical examination, the anal region appeared uneven, with an old surgical scar visible at the 3 o\u2019clock position in the lithotomy position. A firm, irregularly surfaced mass measuring approximately 1 \u00d7 1 cm was located 2 cm from the anal margin at the 3 o\u2019clock position, with local redness, swelling, and minimal discharge. Digital rectal examination revealed a mass at the same position, with slight blood staining on the glove upon withdrawal. No other abnormalities were detected.

      "findings_text": "Stem cells have recently gained prominence as a promising therapeutic approach. These unspecialized cells possess the remarkable ability to differentiate into any specific cell type within an organism. This characteristic enables them to self-renew and be utilized in the treatment of various diseases. Stem cells are present throughout all stages of life, including adulthood, with a high concentration in embryos. However, their differentiation potential diminishes over time, limiting their ability to transform into specific cell types within certain organs. Despite this temporal reduction in differentiation potential, each developmental stage at which stem cells undergo differentiation presents distinct advantages and limitations that vary according to the specific disease context [ The study selection process involved a comprehensive search of PubMed and Web of Science databases for literature published between 1990 and 2025. The search strategy utilized the terms \u201cstem cell\u201d and \u201cstem cell therapy\u201d in conjunction with discipline-specific terminology corresponding to each relevant medical specialty, including dermatology, nephrology, aesthetic medicine, endocrinology, neurology, cardiology, hematology, gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal diseases, infertility and oncology. Stem cells are categorized based on their differentiation potential, ranging from highest to lowest potency, as totipotent, pluripotent, multipotent, oligopotent, and unipotent [ Totipotent cells represent the stem cells with the highest differentiation potential, capable of giving rise to both the embryo and extra-embryonic structures. A prime example of a totipotent cell is the zygote, which forms immediately following fertilization [ During the blastocyst stage, two distinct cell groups are present: the trophectoderm and the inner cell mass. The trophectoderm develops into the placenta, while the stem cells within the inner cell mass, which are pluripotent, form the fetus. Pluripotent stem cells have the ability to differentiate into endoderm, ectoderm and mesoderm cells. Unlike totipotent stem cells, these pluripotent cells do not give rise to extraembryonic structures. Embryonic stem cells are derived from the pluripotent cells of the inner cell mass [ Pluripotent cells differentiate into multipotent stem cells following the formation of germ layers. The differentiation capacity of multipotent stem cells is more restricted compared to pluripotent stem cells, as they can only generate cell types within their specific germ layer. Hematopoietic stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells serve as examples of multipotent stem cells [ Multipotent cells further differentiate into oligopotent cells. As the name implies, oligopotent cells have a more restricted differentiation capacity, capable of developing into only a few cell types. Myeloid progenitor cells are an example of oligopotent cells [ Unipotent stem cells can differentiate into a single specific cell type, possessing the m",

The patient had a history of hypertension and intermittently took medication for treatment. He had previously undergone a subtotal gastrectomy due to a gastric ulcer. Three months ago, the patient developed perianal swelling and pain after consuming spicy food. A palpable mass was noted, but there was no significant pain. After applying ointment externally, the mass subsided. Two weeks ago, following another episode of consuming spicy food, the patient experienced perianal discharge, accompanied by yellowish-white secretion, with significant swelling and pain. The patient subsequently sought medical attention at the hospital. Upon conducting an anal examination, the doctor found a 0.5 cm\u2005\u00d7\u20050.5\u2009cm fistula opening approximately 3\u2009cm from the anal margin at the 4 o\u2019clock and 7 o\u2019clock positions. A cord-like structure could be palpated at the 3 o\u2019clock position along the fistula tract, with notable tenderness on palpation. Coagulation tests showed an Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) of 58.10 seconds. The blood routine analysis revealed a mean platelet volume of 9.30 fL and a Platelet-Larger Cell Ratio (P-LCR) of 19.10 %. No significant abnormalities were observed in the infection disease quantitative tests or blood biochemistry. MRI of the anal canal, including plain scan, diffusion, and dynamic enhancement, showed abnormal signals at the 5 o\u2019clock position in the anal sphincter (internal opening), approximately 3.6\u2009cm from the anal margin. Two fistula tracts (at 5 o\u2019clock and 7 o\u2019clock) were visualized, extending downward through the intersphincteric branches, with the external opening at the gluteal skin.

      "findings_text": "A 21-year-old man presented with CD in the small intestine diagnosed 10 months previously, complicated by anemia and osteopenia. He had been previously treated with mesalazine and steroids for 3 months. However, he did not return for follow-up care. Six months later, he was admitted to emergency department complaining of general weakness and right buttock and lower back pain for a duration of 3 months. No abdominal pain, fever, or weight loss was observed. Due to his lack of follow-up, he was not on any other long-term medication. On physical examination, his right buttock was swollen with focal tenderness. His laboratory test results were as following: hemoglobin of 10.6 g/dL, white blood cell (WBC) count of 11,500/mm A recommendation was made for admission, but the patient refused and was started on antibiotic treatment through outpatient visit. During outpatient care begun since March 2021, he was treated with cefixime (200 mg/day) and metronidazole (1,500 mg/day) for 2 weeks and maintained on mesalazine (4,000 mg/day). The patient reported improvement in buttock and lower back pain in response to medication, but when the antibiotic drugs were stopped, the pain recurred. As the pain gradually worsened, he was admitted. Antibiotic treatment was started with Piperacillin/Tazobactam (4.5 g t.i.d/day) on the first day of hospitalization. On the 3rd day, the patient had elevated temperature up to 38.3\u2103. Blood culture was performed to differentiate infection, and acetaminophen was prescribed to control temperature. On abdominopelvic CT, the abscess pocket extent remained unchanged. Despite the antibiotic treatment, there was no improvement in abscess extent and the patient complained of diarrhea and fever. Therefore, we determined that antibiotic treatment was unsuccessful, so surgical incision and drainage were done for abscesses on the 5th day. After initial drainage of purulence, massive irrigation was performed and 4 Penrose drains were inserted at surgical site ( Following surgery, infliximab induction therapy was considered for the remaining complex fistulas in pelvic cavity. The first induction infliximab (230 mg, 5 mg/kg) was administered on the 12th day and the CDAI was moderate (220.72). About 2 weeks after the surgery, on the 18th day of hospitalization, the laboratory test results improved to near normal: hemoglobin of 12.1 g/dL, WBC of 4,400/mm Postoperatively, buttock and lower back abscess resolved. The amount of secretion at the surgical site was also decreased, and 2 Penrose drains were removed. The patient was discharged with controlled symptoms following initial infliximab injection, and week 2 and 6 injections were done through the outpatient care. After three doses in the induction regimen (on week 0, 2, and 6), abdominopelvic CT after 3 months showed that the extent of multiple abscess pockets in right gluteal muscle and presacral space was decreased and remaining multiple fistula tracts and multifocal enhancing wall thickening",

We deemed surgical resection, including the area of skin invasion, to be appropriate and performed RAPR with lymph node dissection using the da Vinci Xi system (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The patient cart was docked on the patient\u2019s right side, and the 4 robotic ports were placed in a straight line from the left lower quadrant to the right upper quadrant, opposite to the usual configuration to accommodate the organ positioning of SIT. We made a midline incision and inserted an EZ Access port (Hakko, Nagano, Japan).

Because of the patient\u2019s SIT anatomy, we performed the standard surgical procedure in a mirrored fashion. We initiated surgery with a peritoneal incision posterior to the IMA and performed ligation of the IMA with lymphadenectomy and mobilization of the colon using a medial-to-lateral approach. Initially, we used monopolar curved scissors with the right robotic arm (port number 4) and fenestrated bipolar forceps with the left arm (port number 2). However, manipulation with the right arm was restricted when working proximally near the IMA root ( IMA, inferior mesenteric artery The operative time was 334 min, excluding the cutaneous reconstruction, with an estimated blood loss of 15 mL.

A four-port laparoscopic technique was employed, consisting of a 5-mm optical trocar, a 3-mm working port in the left lower quadrant, and two additional 3-mm ports at the right anterior superior iliac spine and McBurney\u2019s point. CO Laparoscopic dissection proceeded from the peritoneal reflection to the RUF, with careful separation of the fistula at its urethral entry point. The secondary vascular arch of the sigmoid colon was mobilized to ensure tension-free straightening of the distal rectum. The surgical team then addressed the perineal phase. Electrical stimulation was used to locate the contraction center of the anal sphincter before incising the overlying skin. Using curved forceps, preserves sphincter muscles by creating a passage through the center without division, until pelvic entry was achieved. The rectal fistula was ligated and divided. The distal rectum was exteriorized through the perineal incision, trimmed, and reconstructed via interrupted 4-0 absorbable sutures to complete the anoplasty. After separating the fistula along the perirectal area distally at the point where the fistula entered the urethra. The operator turned to the perineum, using curved forceps, thread a silk through the tunnel established at the center of the sp",

Seventeen patients dropped out of the study; thus, 63 were included in the final follow-up protocol. Their average age was 51.98\u00a0years (18\u201380\u00a0years), and 20 patients were female. Each participant had a complex perianal fistula. The fistulas were primary (49 patients) or recurring (14 patients), and all involved at least 30% external anal sphincter fibres. Seven patients had two fistula tracts originating from a single internal orifice. Of these, two had horseshoe fistulas. Four patients had Crohn\u2019s disease and were being treated with mesalazine and corticosteroids but not biologic therapy at the time of the study. In 22 patients, a drainage loop was positioned in the fistula tract before surgery to ensure correct drainage and prevent abscess formation. Fifty-three patients underwent surgery under general anaesthesia, and 10 underwent surgery under spinal anaesthesia. All the patients\u2019 baseline characteristics are presented in Table\u00a0 Sociodemographic features, fistula characteristics and previous drainage loop positioning of the study population Data are expressed as the number of patients and percentage The mean volume of material that was purified and then injected was 24\u00a0ml (range 5\u201340\u00a0ml). No intraoperative difficulties related to lipoaspiration or the use of the Lipogems system were encountered. Among patients treated only with MSCs, clinical success was achieved in 43 patients (68.25%), while 20 patients either did not achieve immediate clinical success (9/20) or experienced recurrence (11/20).

Despite advances in biologic therapy and a range of operative interventions, durable healing remains elusive in many cases\u00a0[ MSCs are multipotent stromal cells harvested from adipose tissue or bone marrow, expanded ex\u00a0vivo under clinical\u2010grade conditions, and injected locally into fistula tracts. Rather than integrating into tissue, they act through paracrine signaling, modulating local immune responses, suppressing pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines, and promoting epithelial repair. These properties have led to increasing interest in their use for PFCD, particularly in patients who have failed conventional therapies. MSCs suppress pro\u2010inflammatory mediators including TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u201012, and IFN\u2010\u03b3, while enhancing regulatory cytokines such as IL\u201010 and TGF\u2010\u03b2 [ ADMIRE\u2010CD was the first Phase 3, double\u2010blind randomized control trial (RCT) evaluating allogeneic adipose\u2010derived MSCs in 212 patients with complex PFCD [ ADMIRE\u2010CD II, a subsequent Phase 3 trial of 568 patients, sought to replicate ADMIRE\u2010CD outcomes [ Subsequent trials have explored whether MSCs may offer greater benefit in patients with more anatomically complex or biologically refractory disease. Lightner et\u00a0al. [ A recent meta\u2010analysis [ Beyond patient phenotype and surgical technique, variability in outcomes may also reflect differences in cell origin and manufacturing. Factors such as donor characteristics, use of pooled versus single donors, autologous compared to allogeneic sources, and the tissue of origin (e.g., adipose versus bone marrow) may influence potency. Adipose\u2010derived MSCs may offer immunomodulatory advantages, while bone marrow\u2010derived MSCs are affected by donor age. Dosing strategy, frequency of injection, and ex\u00a0vivo pre\u2010conditioning with cytokines such as TNF\u2010\u03b1 and IFN\u2010\u03b3 are additional variables that may modulate therapeutic efficacy. The collective evidence likely points to a broader issue: the variability in outcomes possibly reflects differences in patient selection, delivery techniques, and disease complexity rather than solely failure of MSC therapy itself. MSCs may offer limited benefit in surgically optimized, low\u2010risk tracts, but could hold value in anatomically complex or biologically active disease. Defining the appropriate clinical phenotype remains a key unmet need in trial design and real\u2010world application. An alternative hypothesis is that earlier application of MSCs may enhance therapeutic success. Delivering cell\u2010based therapies before extensive fibrosis, chronic tract maturation, and multiple surgical interventions occur may allow better cellular engraftment, immunomodulation, and tissue regeneration. Most current trials enroll refractory, heavily pre\u2010treated patients, where fibrotic changes may limit MSC efficacy. Earlier intervention, when the fistula remains biologically active but structurally less disrupted, may represent an important direction",

The dam was reared in Estonia and imported to Germany for superovulation and embryo transfer. Artificial insemination with Aberdeen Angus semen imported from the USA was done in Germany. An experienced veterinarian transferred the embryos to six different crossbreed heifers following the German Cattle Breeders Association protocol [ This case was examined by clinical signs, neurological tests, blood analysis, radiography and magnetic resonance imaging, and postmortem examination. Additionally, the blood specimen was obtained for cytogenetic analysing and whole genome sequencing. At admission to the clinic, the calf was alert and in sternal recumbency with the hind limbs extended to one side and the head positioned normally. The calf could not stand even with assistance, or fully extend both carpal joints, although both front limbs could be extended passively. The calf showed motivation to stand up but could only move the front limbs and was not able to rise on its own. A 6 cm wide, circular, pink excrescence with several wrinkles near to its border, which was well demarcated from the normal skin, was present over the caudal sacral region. In the centre of the hairless area, a raised papillary lesion with a central indentation, approximately 0.8 cm in diameter, was visible (Fig.  A one-day-old Aberdeen Angus calf with a raised hairless area and epidermal ulceration in the dorsal midline of the sacrum Neurological examination revealed normal spinal reflexes in the front limbs. The calf could move the front limbs but could not fully extent both carpal joints. In the hind limbs, paraparesis with decreased muscle tone and severe muscle atrophy was found. The patellar reflex was normal bilaterally, and the flexor reflex response was reduced to absent. The calf remained unable to stand despite daily assistance. The cutaneous trunci reflex was normal bilaterally up to the caudal lumbar area, where no response was elicited. General cutaneous sensitivity was normal in all limbs. Nevertheless, muscle fasciculations were observed in the dorsal skin regions when the hind limbs were stimulated. The tail was flaccid with no active movement. The anal sphincter and tonus were normal. The pupillary light reflex, facial nerve function, palate reflex, and lip tone were normal. The auricular reflex appeared delayed bilaterally; hearing was normal. On the first day postnatum, the calf did not react to visual stimuli. However, in the following days it was noted that visus was not sustained. The animal showed a ventral strabismus in the left eye, ventrolateral strabismus in the right eye, and mild bilateral exophthalmos.

The average age at diagnosis was 35.90 years, ranging from 15 to 70 years, reflecting the bimodal distribution typically observed in IBD onset (15\u201330 years and over 60 years). The mean disease duration was 5.98 years, with the modal disease duration being two years. Most patients (n = 49, 84.5%) resided in urban areas, and 25 patients (43.1%) had completed higher education. Analysis of smoking status indicated that most patients were non-smokers (n = 31, 53.4%) or had quit smoking over one year prior (n = 17, 29.3%). The mean body mass index (BMI) was 23.78 kg/m Regarding disease types, of the 58 enrolled patients, 33 (56.9%) had CD, 24 (41.4%) had UC, and 1 patient was initially diagnosed with IC, but for statistical reasons, we included that patient in UC group. In CD patients, ileocolonic localization was the most frequent, observed in 21 patients (36.2%). The predominant phenotypes of CD included inflammatory (13 patients, 22.4%), stricturing (10 patients, 17.2%), penetrating (7 patients, 12.1%) forms and 3 patients presented overlapping forms. Specifically, 1 patient (1.72%) had both stricturing and perianal disease and 2 (3.45%) patients exhibited penetrating and perianal phenotypes. Among UC patients, most had pancolonic involvement (13 patients, 22.4%), followed by left-sided colitis (9 patients, 15.5%) and proctitis (3 patients, 5.2%). Treatment analysis showed that the majority of patients (n = 26, 44.82%) received biological therapies (Ustekinumab and Vedolizumab), 39.65% of patients received anti-TNF therapy, 19% were treated with aminosalicylates, 10% with corticosteroids, and only 2% with immunosuppressants. Surgical resection of gastrointestinal tract segments was performed in 10 out of the 58 patients (17.2%). To identify risk factors potentially influencing MASLD development among patients diagnosed with IBD, statistical associations between IBD type, HBI, Mayo Score, CRP levels, fecal calprotectin, and the presence of hepatic steatosis/fibrosis were examined. Concerning steatosis distribution by IBD type, most CD patients (n = 26, 78.8%) and UC patients (n = 22, 91.7%) had no steatosis (grade S0, Controlled Attenuation Parameter (CAP) < 294 dB/m).

      "clinical_history": "",
      "findings_text": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely regarded as the reference standard for perianal Crohn\u2019s disease, owing to its multiplanar capabilities, excellent soft tissue contrast, and ability to assess the entire pelvic floor, including supralevator and extrapelvic extensions [ By contrast, endoanal ultrasound (EAUS) offers a readily available, low-cost, and radiation-free alternative that can be performed at the bedside, intraoperatively for seton management, or in outpatient clinics. Modern three-dimensional probes offer high-resolution imaging of the anal sphincter complex and intersphincteric space, allowing for the precise identification of internal openings, delineation of primary and secondary tracts, and detection of associated abscesses. EAUS is particularly useful for classifying fistulas in relation to the sphincters and for guiding intraoperative seton placement [ However, EAUS has intrinsic limitations: very lateral or supralevator tracts and complex secondary extensions are often beyond the field of view, and anal stenosis or severe pain may preclude probe insertion. Buchanan et al. reported that MRI-guided surgical planning was associated with a 75% reduction in postoperative recurrence compared with surgery without MRI guidance [ Comparative studies report variable results. Schwartz et al. Schwartz et al. found EAUS and examination under anesthesia (EUA) to be more accurate than MRI in some cases, with >90% concordance to surgical findings [ Orsoni et al. similarly showed EAUS to be the most sensitive modality among 22 patients with perianal Crohn\u2019s disease [ From a practical perspective, EAUS offers unique organizational advantages: it can be used as a first-line tool for rapid triage, repeated at short intervals to monitor therapeutic response, and used intraoperatively for peri-seton management. MRI, on the other hand, remains indispensable for assessing supralevator disease, deep pelvic sepsis, and fibrosis, and is the only modality with validated scoring indices for clinical trials. Rather than competing, the two techniques are complementary. EAUS ensures bedside accessibility and dynamic follow-up, while MRI provides comprehensive mapping and standardized endpoints. Optimal management, therefore, often requires a tailored approach, and in selected cases, the integration of both modalities ensures the most accurate assessment and guidance for therapy in perianal Crohn\u2019s disease.

Although she did not take any more laxatives thereafter, she started to have severe diarrhea that continued until she presented to our ED 14 days later. The diarrhea occurred more than 10 times per day, was watery and sometimes had bloody streaks but no mucous contents. This was associated with generalized severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting 2 times, as well as low oral intake and fever. She was feeling lethargic and had a headache, but had no visual or other neurological symptoms. She denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitation, cough, flu symptoms, or sore throat. She did not have joint or skin concerns. She denied any oral ulceration, perianal pain, or ulcers. This was the first such episode in her life.

Chronicity can be improved by extending wire retention to 6\u20138 weeks to mimic human fibrotic progression, a recommendation grounded in the pathological characteristics of human complex perianal fistulas, where fibrosis typically develops over weeks to months. Current rodent models (e.g., rats), which rely on acute injury protocols, primarily simulate short-term inflammatory responses and fail to replicate chronic fibrotic stages. This limitation is exemplified by Buchanan et al. [ To augment chronic inflammation and prevent spontaneous healing, we recommend biweekly intraluminal E. coli injections into the fistula tract. This approach addresses limitations of simpler models, as demonstrated by Li et al. [ For longitudinal tracking, contrast-enhanced MRI (e.g., gadolinium-labeled fibrin glue) provides objective monitoring of structural healing. Conventional ultrasound, while non-invasive, faces limitations in differentiating sphincter defects, scar tissue, and active fistulas. Compression during imaging may collapse tracts, leading to underestimation of severity. Hydrogen peroxide-enhanced ultrasound (HPEUS), involving microbubble generation via hydrogen peroxide injection through the external opening, converts hypoechoic signals to hyperechoic ones, improving diagnostic precision [ Non-human primates and dogs are currently regarded as ideal animal models for anal fistula research. However, porcine models are prioritized due to ethical and practical considerations. To address cost challenges, cost-effective alternatives include using minipigs (smaller size, reduced operational expenses) and collaborative shared-resource facilities. Furthermore, the rubber band ligation method optimized by A Ba-Bai-Ke-Re MMTJ et al. [ We respectfully suggest that the incorporation of these refinements in subsequent studies could further enhance the translational value of this promising approach. By integrating pathophysiologically representative models with advanced imaging modalities, the evidence base supporting hUCMSCs-Exo therapy may be strengthened. We anticipate with interest future work that builds upon these foundational insights to explore clinical translation. ",

Our local pelvic MRI protocol for assessing perianal fistulas remained unchanged with no significant changes throughout the study period and included sagittal, coronal, and axial T2\u2010weighted sequences, axial T2\u2010weighted sequences with fat suppression, T1\u2010weighted axial sequences with fat suppression pre\u2010contrast followed by T1\u2010weighted axial, and coronal with fat suppression postcontrast sequences after intravenous administration of gadolinium. Supplementary Table\u00a0 A single radiologist (JR), with more than 15\u00a0years of experience in IBD imaging, evaluated all pelvic MRI at baseline and follow up and their characteristics and calculated the fistula volumetry in all assessments. The radiologist was blinded to clinical assessments and outcomes. The information obtained from the interpretation of this radiologist was used for the statistical analysis of this study. To determine the inter\u2010observer agreement of the fistula volumetry, a second radiologist (MS) with 4\u00a0years (after having finished residency) of experience in abdominal radiology calculated the volumetry of 10 pairs of pelvic MRIs randomly selected. Perianal fistulas were defined as tracts connecting the anus or rectum and the perianal skin or other organs according to the ECCO\u2010ESGAR recommendations [ Fistula volume was calculated using dedicated software (Entrolytics, Motilent, UK) after manual segmentation of the fistula tract. This software enabled the calculation of the volume of both the active and fibrotic components within each tract of the perianal fistulas. The active component was defined as the sections presenting hypersignal in the T2\u2010weighted sequences with fat suppression, interpreted as either fluid or granulation tissue, while the fibrotic component was defined as the area presenting hypo signal in T2\u2010weighted sequences with and without fat suppression. To determine the volume of the active component, we utilized T2\u2010weighted sequences with fat suppression in the axial plane. For the volume of the fibrotic component, we employed T2\u2010weighted sequences without fat suppression in the axial plane. Following the manual segmentation of each component separately (active and fibrotic), the software automatically generates a three\u2010dimensional model. This enables the user to ascertain whether any overlaps or gaps have been generated between the two components during the segmentation process and to correct them if necessary (Figure\u00a0 Example of manual segmentation of a perianal fistula for volume evaluation using dedicated software (Entrolytics). Figure A displays an axial T2\u2010weighted image with fat suppression revealing a complex fistula. The active component of the fistula is highlighted in red.

Thereafter, the diagnosis of CD was made based on histopathological findings. Infliximab therapy was initiated (5 mg/kg IV at weeks 0, 2, and 6, followed by every 8 weeks). Eight years later, the patient developed a complex perianal fistula, marking the beginning of a prolonged course of perianal CD. Since then, the patient underwent surgical interventions on nine occasions due to recurrent CD-related complications. Because of inadequate disease control, a loop colostomy was performed approximately 18 months prior to admission. The patient was a heavy smoker with several unsuccessful attempts to quit. Upon admission, the patient reported low back pain and intermittent drainage from a perianal fistula. Notably, two months prior to admission, the patient experienced similar painful symptoms, which at that time were attributed to an interpolar right renal calculus, confirmed by ultrasonography in the local city hospital. Upon hospital admission, the patient presented with the following signs: heart rate of 110 beats per minute, without abnormal lung sounds, oxygen saturation of 97%, and was afebrile.

Pelvic MRI was performed prior to the operative procedure using a 1.5T system with a four-channel phased array coil. Field of view consisted of the lower pelvis, perineum, and skin area with a full display of the anus and lower-mid rectum. The MRI protocol consisted of T2w sequences with and without fat saturation in three planes: axial, sagittal, and coronal. Fistulas were identified based on hyperintens (white) signal. The pre- and post-operative MRIs were in random order. The modified van Assche index was used to assess the radiologic severity of pCD and included the following items: fistula extension, hyperintensity on T2w images, rectal wall involvement, presence of inflammatory mass, and the dominant feature of the fistula tract.

      "clinical_history": "",
      "findings_text": "Demographic and clinical characteristics This prospective randomized controlled trial enrolled 100 patients with fistula-in-ano, equally allocated into two groups: laser surgery (n\u202f=\u202f50, 50%) and open surgery (n\u202f=\u202f50, 50%), using an even-odd randomization method at enrollment. The mean age of participants was 42.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f10.2 years. Most patients were aged 35-50 years (n\u202f=\u202f55, 55%), followed by 51-65 years (n\u202f=\u202f25, 25%) and 18-34 years (n\u202f=\u202f20, 20%). A male predominance was observed with 78 males (n\u202f=\u202f78, 78%) and 22 females (n\u202f=\u202f22, 22%), consistent with global epidemiological trends. Occupationally, 40 patients (n\u202f=\u202f40, 40%) were manual laborers, 35 (n\u202f=\u202f35, 35%) were office workers, and 25 (n\u202f=\u202f25, 25%) were unemployed or engaged in domestic duties. Socioeconomic assessment revealed that individuals from lower-income backgrounds often experienced delayed access to care. A majority (n\u202f=\u202f60, 60%) resided in rural areas, while 40 (n\u202f=\u202f40, 40%) lived in urban settings, suggesting geographical disparities in healthcare access.

MRI and clinical evaluation identified 55 intersphincteric (n\u202f=\u202f55, 55%) and 45 transsphincteric (n\u202f=\u202f45, 45%) fistulas. The most common external opening was at the 6 o\u2019clock position (n\u202f=\u202f50, 50%), followed by 3 o\u2019clock and 9 o\u2019clock (n\u202f=\u202f30, 30%) and 12 o\u2019clock (n\u202f=\u202f20, 20%). Most patients (n\u202f=\u202f80, 80%) had single-tract fistulas, while 20 (n\u202f=\u202f20, 20%) had multiple tracts, including 15 with secondary extensions (n\u202f=\u202f15, 15%) and 10 with associated abscess cavities (n\u202f=\u202f10, 10%), adding to the complexity of management. All patients underwent either endoscopic radial-emitting diode laser ablation or open surgery, which included fistulectomy (n\u202f=\u202f30, 30%), fistulotomy (n\u202f=\u202f10, 10%), and the LIFT procedure (n\u202f=\u202f10, 10%).

The initial phase, involving six rats, served as a pilot study to clarify doubts and refine the surgical process. Following this pilot phase, the remaining 20 rats were operated on in the second phase. Two fistulas were produced in each animal, resulting in a total of 52 fistulas. The average weight of the animals at the beginning of the experiment was 311 grams, and at the end of the first 30 days of the experiment, an average of 376 grams was weighed. An average weight gain of 64.3 grams was observed after thirty days. Daily monitoring of all animals in their cages throughout the experiment indicated absence of suffering. Specifically, mouse grimace scale scores were consistently 0 (not present) for all assessed facial action units (orbital tightening, nose bulge, cheek bulge, ear position, and whisker change). Moreover, no behavioral changes, wounds, or bleeding were noted, even in the four rats that subsequently developed abscesses or those that lost their seton. At the end of the experiment, eight setons were lost, leaving a total of 44 fistulas to be studied. Only one rat lost both setons and was excluded from the study, resulting in a 96% utilization rate of the animals. There were no animal deaths. All 44 remaining fistulas could be identified by observing the scar of the external orifice two and four weeks after the removal of the metal wire. Four fistulas (4/44) presented external signs of local infection, indicated by the formation of non-drained abscesses, one in the two-week group (1/22) and three in the four-week group (3/22).

A superficial linear transducer of 7.5 MHz, Mindray DC30 ultrasound machine was used to assess the perianal region in all the patients, and a deep curved probe of 3.5 MHz was used to follow the long tracts of some fistulas. Scanning was performed in the knee-chest position or in left lateral decubitus position. The ultrasound probe was wrapped with a latex cover after applying a contact gel to its surface. TCUS scanning of the perianal region was performed in the sagittal, coronal, and axial planes. The probe was placed over the anal canal and the EO of the tract in all patients and ultrasound images was obtained in different planes as necessary. The distance of the IO of the fistula from the anal verge was described, the length of the tract was evaluated to the EO, and any ramifications in the tract was described In the ultrasound images, the fistular tract appears as a tubular hypoechoic structure starting from the anal canal and extended to the perianal skin.

This adjustment was made at the radiologist's discretion, based on real-time evaluation and specific diagnostic needs. For the purpose of this study, all 3D-EAUS cubes and MRI examinations were evaluated retrospectively in consensus. The 3D-EAUS images were reviewed jointly by a surgeon and a radiologist, while the MRI studies were assessed by 2 radiologists, each with over 10 years of experience in pelvic imaging. Fistulas were classified as non-anorectal if the imaging showed no morphological connection to the anorectal musculature and subepithelial tissue. The anatomical characteristics of the fistulas were examined as follows, based on previous studies [ (1) Internal orifice: The number and location on a clock-face dial, with the patient in the lithotomy position. (2) Primary tract: The number, location on a clock-face dial, and classification according to the Parks classification, based on the relationship with the anal sphincters (intersphincteric, transsphincteric, suprasphincteric, or extrasphincteric) [ (3) Possible secondary extensions: The number and location of branches and/or abscesses in relation to perianal spaces, which include the submucosal, superficial/perianal, postanal, intersphincteric, ischioanal, supraelevator, retrorectal, and intramural rectal spaces. The intramural rectal space is defined as the area between the rectal muscular layers, continuing into the space between the conjoint longitudinal muscle and the internal anal sphincter. The \"outersphincteric\" space is defined as the area between the external anal sphincter and the surrounding lateral fascia [ Based on these imaging analyses, all included examinations were evaluated according to the described anatomical characteristics of the fistulas and categorized using a new classification system ( According to this classification, fistulas classified as grades 0 to 2 were categorized as simple and amenable to fistulotomy, whereas those classified as grades 3 to 5 were categorized as complex, not amenable to fistulotomy, and requiring sphincter-saving procedures. Additionally, all fistulas were retrospectively categorized according to the Garg classification ( During the study period, 625 patients referred for treatment of perianal sepsis were evaluated for enrollment. Of these, 85 patients (13.6%) were excluded due to reasons including isolated abscesses, prior radiation therapy, cancer, contraindications to imaging investigations, or the absence of imaging confirmation of an anorectal origin of the sepsis.

      "clinical_history": "",
      "findings_text": "On MRI, the primary opening was categorized to be at three levels - at the dentate line, above the dentate line, and below the dentate line. The length of the surgical anal canal [distance between the anal verge and the anorectal sling (lower border of the levator ani muscle)] was calculated on MRI by the method described below. The primary internal opening was categorized on MRI as When the primary internal opening was located >33% of the total length of the surgical anal canal from the anal verge (upper 2/3 of the\u00a0surgical anal canal) When the primary internal opening was located <25% of the total length of the surgical anal canal from the anal verge (below the lower 1/4 of the\u00a0surgical anal canal) When the primary internal opening was located between 25 to 33% of the total length of the surgical anal canal from the anal verge (between lower 1/4 and upper 2/3 of the\u00a0surgical anal canal) There is no paper or study in the literature which attempted to find the level of the internal opening and correlate it with the dentate line. So, based on our experience and a pilot study, we defined the level of the dentate line on the MRI. The dentate line is an anatomical landmark present on rectal mucosa. It can be seen intraoperatively on visual inspection but is not visible on MRI. So, before initiating the study, we analysed a cohort of 50 patients of anal fistula who were never operated before for the fistula and in whom the internal opening was present at the dentate line (these patients were not included in the study). Then, in these patients, we correlated the level of the internal opening with relation to the boundaries/ landmarks of the surgical anal canal on the MRI scan. This demonstrated that the level of the internal opening (hence the dentate line) was present between 25 to 33% of the total length of the surgical anal canal from the anal verge (between lower 1/4 and upper 2/3 of the\u00a0surgical anal canal). This led to further deduction of the level of the internal opening above or below the dentate line as mentioned above. This categorization of the primary internal opening in relation to the dentate line was apart from the location of the primary opening, the amount of external anal sphincter (EAS) by the fistula was also noted and tabulated. This parameter, \u201cheight of penetration of external sphincter (HOPE)\u201d, is considered important to classify fistulas. The approval was taken from the Ethics Committee of Indus International Hospital via reference No EC/IIH-IEC/SP6. The patients were informed about the purpose of the study, written informed consent was obtained, and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The two important landmarks to be identified on an MRI are the \u2018anorectal sling\u2019 and the \u2018anal verge\u2019 as the distance between these two is the length of the \u2018surgical anal canal\u2019.

However, 537 did not meet the inclusion criteria ( During an emergency proctology visit, incisional drainage under local anesthesia was performed on 155 patients (56.2%), with or without concurrent antibiotic therapy. Before their emergency visit, 68 patients (24.6%) had been treated with antibiotics for a median duration of 6 days (IQR, 2.5\u20136.5 days). The management of oral antibiotic therapy varied, with 49 cases where it was stopped, 19 where it continued, and 56 where it was newly prescribed. Consequently, a total of 124 patients (44.9%) received antibiotics, of whom 102 (82.3%) were treated for at least 3 days. The primary antibiotics administered were amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in 56.5% of cases, metronidazole in 21.0%, and pristinamycin in 17.7%. Subsequently, 178 patients (64.5%) underwent surgery within an average of 21.0 days (IQR, 10.0\u201346.5 days) following their emergency visit, with fistulas identified in 169 patients (94.9%). At the 1-year mark, 44 patients (17.8%) had no recorded follow-up, including 37 (13.4%) who had no further follow-up after their initial emergency visit and were therefore presumed not to have a fistula. At the 1-year follow-up, fistulas were detected in 181 of 276 patients (65.6%) through EAUS, MRI, and/or intraoperative physical examination. Of these cases, surgical drainage was performed in 169 (93.4%). Notably, 12 patients either declined surgery or were lost to follow-up despite having a scheduled operation. Univariate analysis indicated that patients who had received prior antibiotic therapy were less likely to have a surgical indication established during their first emergency visit compared to patients not receiving prior antibiotic therapy (50.0% vs. 63.8%, P=0.027). Similarly, at EAUS, fistulas were found less frequently in patients who had received prior antibiotic therapy (43.8% vs. 74.0%, P=0.010). The 1-year fistula rate was significantly lower in patients who had received antibiotics, regardless of whether a local incision had been made ( Propensity analysis, employing either 1:1 matching or inverse probability of treatment weighting, corroborated these findings: antibiotics significantly reduced the incidence of fistulas at 1 year ( ",

The system employs excitation wavelengths of 785\u2009\u00b1\u20095 nm and detects fluorescence emission in the 830\u2013900 nm range. Advanced image enhancement based on a generative adversarial network facilitated multiscale detail amplification.

A total of 533 patients undergoing low anterior resection were included in the study, with 402 patients in the non-FL group and 131 patients in the FL group before propensity score matching (PSM). After PSM with 1:2 ratio, 262 patients were successfully matched in the non-FL group to the 131 patients in the FL group. The demographic and clinical characteristics before and after PSM are summarized in Table\u00a0 Patient demographic characteristics and surgical procedures before and after the PSM Values in parentheses are percentages unless indicated otherwise; value in *mean (standard deviation) Prior to matching, significant differences were observed between the groups, particularly in surgical strategy. The FL group had a markedly higher rate of left colic artery (LCA) preservation compared with the non-FL group (77.1% versus 48.0%,  Following PSM, baseline characteristics between the two cohorts were well balanced across all measured variables, with standardized mean differences (SMDs) falling below the conventional threshold of 0.20, indicating adequate covariate balance.

      "findings_text": "A 78-year-old man with advanced rectal cancer received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and subsequently underwent a low anterior resection with side-to-end anastomosis in January 2011. The postoperative course was uneventful, and histopathological examination confirmed a good response to neoadjuvant therapy. In the following years, the patient developed severe LARS, for which TAI was initiated twice weekly. One year post-surgery, the patient developed anastomotic stenosis and perianal irritation. Sigmoidoscopy revealed purulent discharge from the blind end of the rectal stump. TAI continued to effectively control LARS symptoms for years, but in 2018, sacral and perianal pain developed. Inflammatory markers in 2019 suggested inflammation, but no malignancy was detected, and the pain was attributed to musculoskeletal causes. Thirteen years after resection, worsening left buttock pain, swelling, and purulent rectal discharge prompted further investigation, which revealed a new complication. A computed tomography scan of the pelvis revealed a significant presacral fluid collection. A fistulous tract extended through the levator ani muscle to the left gluteal region, where a distinct subcutaneous abscess was identified in the gluteal cleft. Endoscopic examination showed that the functional limb of the anastomosis was intact, whereas the blind-ended limb was stenosed and discharging pus, clearly communicating with the presacral collection. Perianal examination revealed significant inflammation with central fluctuance, consistent with an abscess ( Endoscopic view of the colo-anal anastomosis. The blind-closed portion on the right ( arrow) represents the stapled end of the side-end anastomosis. Following the diagnosis of a likely bowel perforation with abscess and fistula, the patient underwent urgent surgery. An initial incision and drainage of the gluteal abscess were performed, followed by sigmoidoscopy, which confirmed a communication with a blind-ended anastomotic limb. Due to the severity and the patient\u2019s prior LARS, a definitive abdominoperineal excision (APE) was performed 1 week later. Intraoperative adhesions complicated neorectal mobilization, which was halted at the pelvic floor. A diverting sigmoidostomy with mesh reinforcement was created. The perineal portion involved anal closure and excision of the anal canal, remaining neorectum, and fistula. The perineal wound was irrigated, and a vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) system was applied. Histopathological examination of the resected specimen revealed no evidence of recurrent malignancy. The findings were consistent with chronic inflammation and the presence of a fistulous tract. Postoperatively, the patient\u2019s perineal wound was managed with a VAC system, requiring three dressing changes: the first to remove fecal contamination and subsequent changes to stimulate granulation tissue. After this phase, the infection was controlled, and the perineal wound was closed and dressed with a Prevena dress",

He had a history of smoking (approximately 20 pack-years) and lived in a rural area with limited access to healthcare services. There was no relevant personal or family history of colorectal or perianal disease. Written informed consent for emergency treatment was obtained from the patient, and the patient\u2019s family provided written consent for the use of anonymized data in this report. The patient presented to the emergency department with diffuse abdominal pain lasting for three days, accompanied by high-grade fever, chills, and marked deterioration of his general condition. On physical examination, the abdomen was moderately distended with diffuse tenderness and generalized guarding, consistent with signs of peritoneal irritation. Digital rectal examination was unremarkable, with normal findings of the ischiorectal fossae and overlying skin. Initial vital signs revealed hypotension (blood pressure: 95/60 mmHg), tachycardia (heart rate: 118 beats per minute), tachypnea (respiratory rate: 24 breaths per minute), hyperthermia (temperature: 39.2 \u00b0C), and an oxygen saturation of 92% on room air.

      "clinical_history": "",
      "findings_text": "MRI images are acquired in 3 orthogonal planes: axial (transverse), coronal, and sagittal. However, most MRI analysis applications also provide biplanar (2 sections) or multiplanar (3 sections) viewing modes ( This capability can also be used to identify the coronal slice at the exact midpoint of the anal canal. In biplanar mode, with both coronal and axial views displayed, clicking on the coronal section will project its position as a horizontal line on the axial view. Then, the coronal section can be slid anteriorly or posteriorly until that horizontal line bisects the anal canal into anterior and posterior halves ( On MRI, 2 key landmarks must be identified: the anorectal sling and the anal verge. The distance between these points defines the length of the surgical anal canal [ The anorectal sling appears on MRI as the inferior border of the levator ani muscle ( After identifying the anorectal sling and the anal verge, the distance between these landmarks on MRI can be measured using the scale tool in RadiAnt DICOM Viewer (Medixant) ( In biplanar mode, an axial section should be displayed on one side ( The intersection of the horizontal yellow line (marking the level of the internal opening) and the vertical red axis of the surgical anal canal precisely locates the primary internal opening in relation to the surgical anal canal. The distance from the intersection to the anal verge (the lower red horizontal line) represents the height of the opening above the verge. Dividing this value by the total length of the surgical anal canal (the red vertical line) yields the relative position of the primary opening within the canal ( Once the opening\u2019s position has been determined, it can be reported either in relation to the length of the surgical anal canal or relative to the dentate line. To express its relation to the dentate line, the following method is employed. The dentate line is an anatomical landmark on the mucosal surface. Although visible intraoperatively, it cannot be seen on MRI. Anatomically, it lies approximately 25% to 33% up the surgical anal canal\u2014that is, at the junction of the lower one-third and upper two-thirds [ If the measurement falls between 25% and 33% of the surgical anal canal length, the primary internal opening is considered to be at the level of the dentate line. If it is less than 25%, the primary opening lies below the dentate line. If it is greater than 33%, the primary opening lies above the dentate line. The sphincter is shorter in the anterior direction, especially in women. Therefore, in addition to the above calculation, the sagittal view is also helpful for determining the height of the internal opening and the point at which the fistula tract penetrates the external sphincter. Similarly, in patients with previous surgery, resultant fibrosis should be considered when calculating the opening\u2019s height.

      "clinical_history": "",
      "findings_text": "A 36-year-old male patient presented with persistent discharge, pruritus, and pain. The patient had experienced multiple episodes of recurrent perianal abscesses, which were managed with incision and drainage. Over the past year, he developed continuous purulent discharge from a newly formed external opening in the right gluteal region, lateral to the ischial tuberosity. His symptoms progressively worsened, leading to a marked decline in quality of life. MRI revealed a complex fistula with more than three secondary tracts, the longest of which extended approximately 20 cm and opened into the right gluteal region. The primary tract was located at the 7-8 o\u2019clock position in relation to the rectum. VAAFT\u00a0was undertaken with the primary aim of accurately localizing the internal opening and comprehensively mapping the fistulous tract architecture. The procedure was conducted under general anesthesia with the patient positioned in the prone jackknife posture to optimize perineal access. Following standard antiseptic preparation, the fistuloscope was carefully introduced through the external opening, allowing real-time endoluminal visualization of the primary tract and any secondary extensions. Continuous irrigation facilitated clear visualization of the epithelialized tract; the internal opening was clearly identified and confirmed by both visual inspection and concurrent transillumination. Thorough curettage and unroofing of the secondary tracts were performed to disrupt the fistulous epithelium and promote healing. A loose draining seton was inserted to maintain adequate drainage and prevent premature closure, thereby minimizing the risk of abscess formation or recurrence. Importantly, the procedure ensured complete preservation of the sphincter mechanism. All surgical steps are demonstrated in Video  At the four-month follow-up, all secondary tracts had successfully closed. However, due to the development of false tracts from prior surgical attempts, the primary tract had progressed to a suprasphincteric course. Consequently, only the main fistulous tract remains, and the patient continues to be followed with a draining seton in place. ",

The patient\u2019s condition showed improvement. Considering the 15-year history of a fistula, the patient was investigated with an MRI fistulogram which revealed a complex fistulous tract extended superiorly to a collection in the ischiorectal space, then into the presacral retroperitoneal space up to the third lumbar vertebra, and tracked along the pelvis and prevesical space beneath the abdominal wall (Figures  MRI: magnetic resonance imaging; T2WI: T2-weighted image; STIR: short tau inversion recovery The pigtail actively drained the intra-abdominal and the retroperitoneal collection which was dependent on the drain whereas the non-dependent area was not approachable by minimally invasive techniques. Hence, surgery was planned, during which the fistulous tract was removed, and the localized collection was drained from the supralevator space using a fair incision in the perianal region exposing the sphincters and draining the supralevator abscess. A Foley catheter was left in situ to flush the wound during regular dressings (Figures  Following surgery, the patient\u2019s condition showed significant improvement, and he was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Culture-specific antibiotics were identified and administered accordingly. The wound received local care under aseptic precautions for one month, and the pigtail catheter in the abdomen was removed after a repeat ultrasound confirmed no residual collection. The patient\u2019s general condition improved, and he was discharged with instructions for regular dressings and follow-up appointments. ",

He was diagnosed with CD at 14 years old and first developed perianal fistulae at the age of 19 years. Since then, he has had multiple hospitalizations for recurrent perianal abscesses requiring both percutaneous and surgical drainage with seton insertion. He underwent two lines of biological treatment, which did not achieve fistula healing. First, he received infliximab but developed antibodies to infliximab after one year, with a secondary loss of response. Next, he received adalimumab but showed no improvement in inflammation and fistula discharge, suggesting primary non-response. At this time, he was clinically malnourished with a body mass index (BMI) of 16.8. Laboratory results showed a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 9.5 g/dL, serum albumin level of 30 g/L, and C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 113.3 mg/L (normal: <3 mg/L). The perianal disease activity index (PDAI) score was 12. Magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis showed a complex intersphincteric fistula with multiple internal openings (Figure  A (left): Appearance at first\u00a0presentation.\u00a0B (middle): Two months post treatment.\u00a0C (right): Five months post treatment. In view of the refractory and debilitating disease with prior failure of two biologics, various options, including switching biologic therapy to ustekinumab (an interleukin-12/23 inhibitor), surgical treatment such as a diverting colostomy, and adjunctive treatment with HBOT, were considered. After discussion, a shared decision was made for ustekinumab with HBOT. He was started on ustekinumab with adjunctive HBOT concurrently (60 sessions, two-hour duration, 2.0 ATA) over a period of three months. He tolerated the HBOT well with no adverse events. On review at 16 weeks after HBOT, clinical examination revealed complete fistula healing with the resolution of perineum swelling, closure of the external orifice, the absence of active perianal discharge, and\u00a0radiological improvement\u00a0(Figure  HBOT:\u00a0hyperbaric oxygen therapy. However, at nine months post-completion of HBOT, he presented with a recurrence of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and active perianal discharge. Repeat imaging showed active intestinal inflammation and recrudescence of a complex perianal fistula with abscess formation. This occurred despite compliance with maintenance therapy with ustekinumab. He was started on antibiotics and subsequently underwent percutaneous drainage of the abscess. While HBOT successfully induced fistula healing initially, the clinical response in this patient was not sustained. ",

She had an ectopic pregnancy and in vitro fertilization around 11 yr ago. Her past medical history indicated that she had a mass on the left labia majora 10 yr ago and was diagnosed with a Bartholin cyst, for which she was treated conservatively. Due to the growth of the mass, computed tomography and MRI were done, and she underwent surgical removal of the mass through the perineum. The pathology of the lesion was AA. Then she underwent another surgery one year later, and the tumor was resected entirely since it had recurred. Considering the high recurrence rate, close follow-up was recommended, but after 2 yr, she voluntarily withdrew from the follow-up sessions. She has had symptoms of gluteal asymmetry and a mass in her left area for the past 2 yr. In addition, she complained of severe vulvar discharge, constipation, and polyuria. On examination, a 5\u201310 cm mass was found in the left gluteal region, causing gluteal asymmetry. On palpation, the mass was soft without tenderness. On inspection, no ulcer or visible discharge were observed. Rectal examination revealed an extra luminal pressure effect that was mobile. On vaginal examination, the effect of mass pressure was detected on the left lateral side of the vagina, but there was no lesion in the vagina or rectum. In routine laboratory investigations, severe anemia (Hb = 7.6 mg/dL) was detected, and a blood transfusion was administered. Abdominal and pelvic CT scans and a chest CT scan reported no abnormality or distant metastasis. Both the colonoscopy and the upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were normal. MRI revealed a gluteal mass with irregular, lobulated, and heterogenous borders situated posterior to the uterus, with the invasion of the soft tissue of the left perirectal and ischio-anal fossae. After injection, the mass had a heterogeneous enhancement and involved parts of the cervix and vagina. It was measured at approximately 65 mm  Recurrent AA was the most suspected in the differential diagnosis of this mass, so she underwent extensive excision of the giant cystic tumor through the perineum. The tumor was located anterior and posterior to the sacrum, with severe adhesion to the surrounding tissue of the vagina and rectum. Therefore, resection with a safe margin was performed (Figure 2). Histopathological examination reported a mesenchymal neoplasm with extensive myxoid background and cellularity, consisting of bland cells and hyaline thick-walled vessels, consistent with AA (Figure 3). 4 days later, she developed a fever and a foul-smelling discharge from the wound. This caused her to return to the operating room again for a possible rectum injury. On reoperation, a rectal wall defect was observed where the mass had been removed.

The study included 69 patients, of whom 59 were males and 10 were females. A total of 80 perianal fistulae were detected in these 69 patients. Out of these patients, 9 (13.00%) had more than one fistula. According to the St. James\u2019s University Hospital classification, most of the perianal fistulas were Grade 1 (42.5%), followed by Grades 2 and 4 (both 21.3%), then Grade 3 (11.3%), and the least common being Grade V (3.8%) fistula and abscess (Tables  Conventional MR imaging parameters Based on active clinical pus discharge, 54 (67.5%) of the fistulas were active, and 26 (32.5%) were inactive.

One hemipelvis was excluded due to the formation of scar tissue (potentially as sequalae of abscess formation) affecting the topography at the transition zone between gluteus maximus and the ischioanal fossa. The ischioanal fossa was completely taken up by the scar tissue which made assessing the various potential connections for this hemipelvis unfeasible. The dissections yielded a series of connective tissue connections originating from gluteus maximus, attaching it to obturator internus, levator ani and the urogenital diaphragm. These connections could further be verified using the plastinated body slices. At the posteromedial border and in the area of the entrance to the ischioanal fossa, the fascia of gluteus maximus yielded attachments to the subcutis via multiple small septa-like fascia extensions. These extensions invested lobules of adipose tissue and were similarly structured as the adipose tissues found in the ischioanal fossa (Fig.\u00a0 Ischioanal fossa on the left side of a body donor in a supine position.

Finally, 475 patients were included in the final analysis (Fig.\u00a0 Flowchart showing the patient inclusion flow in the cohort In total, 322 of the patients were males (67.8%), median age at surgery was 45\u00a0years (IQR 33\u201358\u00a0years) and median BMI was 26.1\u00a0kg/m Patient demographics Figure\u00a0 The anatomical definitions of anal abscesses:  EAUS was performed perioperatively in 137 patients (28.8%). Both centres performed EAUS sporadically when competences were available. The distribution of abscesses in these patients was as follows: perianal, 33.6% (46 of 137); ischioanal, 15.3% (21 of 137); low intersphincteric, 26.2% (36 of 137); high intersphincteric, 9.5% (13 of 137); and supralevator, 1.5% (2 of 137). Horseshoe formation was described in 12.4% (17 of 137), intersphincteric in 10.9% (15 of 137), ischioanal in 0.7% (1 of 137), and one supralevator in 0.7% (1 of 137). Most abscesses (93.3%, 443 of 475) were surgically drained to the skin. However, 6.5% (31 of 475) were drained endoluminally. Of these, 13 were classified as high intersphincteric, 10 as intersphincteric horseshoe and two supralevator. Only one classified as perianal and two as low intersphincteric were described as drained endoluminally according to electronic patient records. The anatomical localisation of the remaining three abscesses was not stated. A fistula was identified during the primary surgery in 84 of 475 (18.4%) patients. Of these, 47.6% (40 of 84) were treated with a seton and 13.1% (3 of 84) with acute fistulotomy, leaving 41 (48.8%) patients treated solely with abscess drainage. At follow-up, 66 of the 81 (81.5%) fistulas persisted (of these 40 were the ones treated with seton at primary surgery). Thus, 18.5% spontaneously healed. During surgery, an underlying fistula was suspected but was not identified by the surgeon in 75 of the 475 patients (15.4%). Of these, only 39 (52.0%) had fistulas at follow-up. Finally, no fistula was suspected in 328 of the 475 patients with acute abscesses. At follow-up of this group, 59 patients (18.0%) had fistulas. A C-reactive protein (CRP) level\u2009>\u2009100\u00a0mg/L was found in 64 of the 475 patients. Of these, the majority of the abscesses were classified as high intersphincteric, ischioanal, horseshoe or supralevator (40 of 64, 62.5%). Almost all abscesses were drained to the skin (92.2%) and only six patients were treated with a seton. Repeat surgery was performed in 16.9% (82 of 475) of the patients.

He denied any fatigue, constipation, bloody stools, or melena. The patient also stated that he had never had a colonoscopy and had no family history of cancer. Reportedly, the mass had been biopsied previously in Mexico with benign results. The patient was hypothermic, with a temperature of 35.0 degrees Celsius, bradycardic (53 beats/min),\u00a0and hypertensive (181/81 mmHg).

The patient reported 5-6 bowel movements per day and denied substantial abdominal pain, fever, or chills. His medical history was significant for recurrent anal fistulas and benign prostatic hyperplasia with chronic outlet obstruction and associated urinary frequency. His surgical history included numerous examinations under anesthesia, endorectal advancement flaps, ligation of an intersphincteric fistula tract (LIFT) procedure, hemorrhoidectomy with anal fistula plug placement, incision and drainage of a perirectal abscess, laparoscopic sigmoid colostomy, and colostomy take-down. His physical exam revealed a soft, nontender, nondistended abdomen. The previous colostomy site and surgical incisions were well-healed. On anorectal exam, there were perianal inflammatory changes consistent with pCD and small tags with minimal induration on the left aspect of the anal canal. There were no abscesses or active sites of drainage. Pertinent labs were within normal limits including a normal C-reactive protein, a normal genotype for thiopurine S-methyltransferase, and a negative intestinal tuberculosis workup. Initial management consisted of switching from Ustekinumab to Infliximab.

Small field-of-view T2 turbo spin echo axial (A and B) and coronal (C and D) MR acquisitions through the anal canal showing a left perineal hernia (dashed white arrow in A and D) containing a segment of low rectum. There is dense scarring in the left ischioanal and perineal fat (solid black arrow in B) from healed fistula tracts; there was no patent perianal fistula. This left perineal hernia distorts the anatomy of the internal sphincter (dashed white outline in A, B, and C) and external sphincter (dashed blue outline in A, B, and C). The loop of the low rectum herniates between the puborectalis (solid white arrow in D) and the external sphincter complex.

Ustekinumab (UST) is in off-label use for refractory CD in children especially those who don\u2019t show a response to anti-TNF. However, data on safety and efficacy in children is limited. Our patient is 15-year-old girl, started to have a recurrent perianal and labial abscess at age of 11 yr. Despite having a normal upper and lower colonoscopy in the first place, pathology examination showed mild regenerative glandular alterations in the rectum. However, she continued to have recurrent peri-anal and vulval abscesses, in November 2016, April 2017, June 2017, and February 2018, which required multiple incision, drainage, fistulotomy as well as antibiotics therapy. Further evaluation revealed an isolated perianal Crohn\u2019s disease for which she was commenced to Adalimumab, and despite optimal dosing, she continued to have an active disease with partial response evidenced by biochemical and radiological findings. The decision was made to shift from Adalimumab to weight-based UST doses based on the promising results in adult CD. Our patient was followed frequently to ensure good therapeutic drug level, inflammatory markers improved from the maximum during her active disease till the last readings (56 weeks after starting UST), ESR (2-34 mm/hr) of 46 to 15 and CRP (1.0-1.7) of 21 to 0.2.

      "findings_text": "The skin is an important organ that covers the human body and interacts directly with the outside world. It plays a key role in immunity, feeling, and protection. In recent years, silica nanoparticles (SNPs) and their multifunctional carriers have gained considerable attention due to their significant advantages in drug delivery. Applications of polymer-coated MSNs in various therapeutic fields, including photodynamic therapy (PDT), photothermal therapy (PTT), chemotherapy, RNA delivery, wound healing, tissue engineering, food packaging, and the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Reprinted from Nair A, Chandrashekhar H R, Day CM, et al. Polymeric functionalization of mesoporous silica nanoparticles: biomedical insights.  Over the past few decades, advancements in nanotechnology have led to the emergence of various nanomaterials and nanomaterial-based drug delivery systems, which have been applied to wound repair and regeneration. Skin wounds are defined as disruptions or damage to the structure and function of the skin caused by various factors, including trauma, burns, and physiological or medical conditions. Following injury, damaged skin initiates a complex repair process involving the interplay of various cell types, cytokines, and biological mediators. Under normal conditions, this process progresses through distinct stages, including hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling ( Damaged skin initiates a complex repair process involving the interaction of multiple cell types, cytokines, and biological mediators. Under normal conditions, this process undergoes a series of stages, including hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. Adapted from from Cioce A, Cavani A, Cattani C, Scopelliti F. Role of the Skin Immune System in Wound Healing.  Immediately after injury, the body triggers hemostatic responses to minimize blood loss. Local blood vessels constrict via smooth muscle contraction to limit blood flow, and both intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways are activated. The inflammatory phase typically occurs from day 2 to day 5 post-injury. During this phase, platelets activated by thrombin release various growth factors, including epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and transforming growth factors (TGF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b2). From 3 days to 2\u00a0weeks post-injury, the wound enters the proliferative phase, characterized by cell proliferation and migration. The remodeling phase involves structural reorganization and cellular reduction. Type III collagen in the granulation tissue is gradually replaced by type I collagen, the primary matrix component of the dermis. The rearrangement, cross-linking, and alignment of collagen fibers involve the dynamic synthesis of collagen and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), leading to ECM strengthening and contraction, and ultimately the formation of mature scar tissue.

      "clinical_history": "",
      "findings_text": "Crohn disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) characterized by transmural inflammation that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus. Clinical manifestations include diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, fatigue, and extraintestinal features such as arthritis and skin lesions. Perianal involvement\u2014particularly anal fistulas and fissures\u2014is frequently associated with more severe disease. Management typically involves immunosuppressive therapy and biologic agents, including antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) medications to control inflammation and prevent complications. Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis (IRF) is a rare, often underdiagnosed condition characterized by inflammation and fibrosis in the retroperitoneal space, which can obstruct surrounding structures such as the ureters, iliac vessels, and abdominal aorta. The estimated incidence of IRF ranges from 0.1 to 1.3 cases per 100,000 individuals annually, highlighting its rarity. The co-occurrence of CD and IRF is exceedingly rare, and only a handful of cases have been reported in the literature. Although associations between ulcerative colitis and IRF have also been documented, the connection between CD and IRF seems to be more commonly observed. This association likely stems from the immune dysregulation and chronic inflammation seen in CD, which can contribute to fibrotic changes in the retroperitoneum. The transmural inflammation in CD, which affects all layers of the bowel wall, including the serosa, likely interacts with the intra-abdominal cavity, increasing the risk of retroperitoneal involvement. Although the precise pathophysiology of this relationship remains unclear, CD with a fistulizing phenotype, characterized by severe transmural inflammation and recurrent tissue damage, is considered more likely to develop IRF. This overlap in clinical features between CD, IRF, and other conditions such as neoplasms can complicate the diagnosis and delay appropriate treatment. Early recognition and management of IRF are critical to preventing complications such as ureteral obstruction and renal damage. Treatment of IRF typically involves corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents, with emerging evidence suggesting that biologics such as infliximab, a TNF-alpha inhibitor, could be beneficial in treating refractory IRF. A 34-year-old man with a diagnosis of CD in 2018 presented with hematochezia, which led to the identification of an anal fissure and perianal fistula. There was no family history of IBD. He underwent an examination under anesthesia but did not require seton placement as the fistula was draining. Colonoscopy revealed severe ulcerations in both the small and large bowel, consistent with CD. Initially, he was treated with weekly adalimumab, which was later reduced to a biweekly regimen as his disease became inactive. Over time, he began to take the medication inconsistently, administering it approximately every 3 to 4 weeks w",

Factors such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection and female gender have been identified as significant risk factors for the spread of EPTB. Diabetes is another critical factor, as multiple studies have shown it to be associated with a higher risk of developing active TB. Moreover, patients with diabetes have a greater risk of developing EPTB compared to pulmonary TB [ Disseminated TB is defined as a tuberculous infection involving the bloodstream, bone marrow, liver or two or more non-contiguous sites, or miliary TB.

      "clinical_history": "",
      "findings_text": "Ileal pouch\u2010anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the preferred surgical option to restore intestinal continuity after proctocolectomy in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), selected patients with colonic Crohn's disease (CD), and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Pouch failure can be salvaged through revisional/redo IPAA surgery. However, in our experience, failing pouches are often labeled as having CD when the etiology of pouch failure may be mechanical or technical. These complications may result in chronic inflammation or persistent fistulae which can be indistinguishable from CD of the pouch. For example, pouch\u2010related fistulas that develop in the setting of an anastomotic or tip of the J leak are often a surgical rather than a CD\u2010related complication. Pouch outlet issues such as a long rectal cuff, pouch constriction from residual mesorectum, or anastomotic strictures lead to obstruction and stasis causing chronic inflammation which can be mistaken as CD. Mechanical issues such as a twisting of the mesentery or pouch elongation from outlet obstruction may appear as inlet issues. Given the diagnostic uncertainty in some patients with a failing pouch, we have offered revisional pouch surgery in the setting of biologic \u201ccoverage\u201d for presumed CD for a select population of highly motivated patients with a severe aversion to a permanent ileostomy. Herein, we share our experience with patients who underwent salvage medical therapy after revisional/redo IPAA with suspicion for CD. Following institutional review board approval (i23\u201001115) of a prospectively maintained pouch registry, a retrospective analysis was conducted of all patients undergoing revisional pouch surgery between September 2016 and December 2022 at the Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Center of NYU Langone Hospital. Patient characteristics, operative details, and postoperative short\u2010 and long\u2010term outcomes were abstracted from the medical record. We also determined functional results using the Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF) Pelvic Pouch Questionnaire which included details pertaining to bowel frequency (number of bowel movements per 24\u2009h), urgency (inability to defer bowel movements for more than 15\u2009min), fecal incontinence (inadvertent passage of liquid or solid stool), need to wear pads, and restrictions (dietary, social, work, sexual). The Cleveland Global Quality of Life (CGQL) score was used to perform assessment of quality of life. All patients presenting for revisional pouch surgery underwent a comprehensive evaluation including: review of prior operative and pathology records; examination under anesthesia (EUA) and pouchoscopy; water\u2010soluble contrast enema (WSCE); and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis. Fistulas were classified using the findings of the preoperative workup as well as intraoperative findings at the time of the revisional pouch surgery.

      "findings_text": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs), nanoscale membrane-bound particles released by diverse cell types including fibroblasts, immune cells (e.g., T cells, B cells, dendritic cells), adipocytes, stem cells, and tumor cells, have emerged as critical mediators of intercellular communication. These vesicles are ubiquitously present in all bodily fluids, such as blood, urine, breast milk, amniotic fluid, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( Stem cells encompass multiple subtypes, notably mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and others. Unlike other stem cell types, MSCs exhibit broader tissue distribution, superior multipotency, and enhanced self-renewal capacity ( Compared with EVs from other sources, EVs derived from MSCs have several potential therapeutic advantages. This is mainly due to a series of novel and beneficial properties ( Unique properties of MSC-EVs and potential therapeutic applications. Therapeutic applications of MSC-EVs across diverse disease types. MSC can release MSC - EVs with capabilities of immunomodulation, improvement of inflammation, vascular and tissue repair, crossing biological barriers, and intrinsic targeting ( MSC-EVs exhibit heterogeneous diameters ranging from tens to hundreds of nanometers, with their size distribution being method-dependent during isolation ( Differential ultracentrifugation remains a gold standard for EVs isolation. The protocol involves sequential centrifugation steps with increasing centrifugal forces to remove cellular debris and subcellular components, followed by ultracentrifugation (\u2265100,000 \u00d7 g) to pellet EVs. Initial low-speed centrifugation eliminates intact cells and large debris, while subsequent high-speed steps clear smaller contaminants. Final ultracentrifugation precipitates EVs, with optional repeat cycles to enhance purity ( The EVs isolated by the differential ultracentrifugation method have a relatively high purity. This method requires expensive specialized equipment such as an ultracentrifuge, with the centrifugal speed needing to reach 100,000 \u00d7 g. EVs can be damaged due to multiple centrifugations at excessively high speeds. During the extraction process, experimenters may perform multiple ultracentrifugations, which may cause certain damage to the structure of EVs. Density gradient centrifugation is an improved method of traditional differential ultracentrifugation. EVs are separated based on buoyant density differences using continuous or discontinuous gradients of sucrose, iodixanol, or cesium chloride. Particles migrate to equilibrium positions matching their densities during centrifugation. The density gradient centrifugation method is an important separation technique. The number of ultracentrifugations can be reduced, thereby maintaining the integrity of vesicles, enabling the separation of different types of extracellular vesicles, and it has been widely applied in fields such as biology and medicine ( Ultraf",

A 36-year-old Gravida 4, Para 3, woman at 5 weeks and 6 days gestation (confirmed by ultrasound) presented to the emergency department (ED) with acute, progressive abdominal pain localized initially to the left lower quadrant, associated with nausea and three episodes of non-bloody, non-bilious vomiting. She had no fever, diarrhea, or urinary symptoms. Her past medical history was significant for Crohn\u2019s disease (fistulizing perianal subtype) diagnosed in 2008, previously treated with infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, and currently on Ustekinumab every four weeks.  Her surgical history included three cesarean sections, multiple incision and drainage procedures for perianal abscesses, and a perianal fistula repair. Her most recent dose of Ustekinumab was administered 10 days prior to presentation.  On examination, she appeared well, with hemodynamic parameters within normal limits. The abdominal exam revealed generalized tenderness without peritoneal signs. The urine pregnancy test was positive, and the serum \u03b2-hCG measured 19,957 IU/L. Bedside ultrasound confirmed an intrauterine gestation with fetal cardiac activity as well as uncomplicated biliary stones. Laboratory studies demonstrated leukocytosis and elevated inflammatory markers (ESR 114 mm/hr, CRP 60 mg/L).

When it affects the perianal region, it can mimic more common conditions, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment. Clinical presentations are often nonspecific, including localized pain, swelling, and tenderness, which overlap with other perianal disorders [ A man in his 40s presented to our surgical unit with a 3-month history of perianal pain, which he described as an intermittent pricking sensation, worsening after bowel movements. The pain was aggravated by consuming spicy food and had no identifiable relieving factors. He also reported a lumpy sensation in the perianal region but denied rectal bleeding, prolapsing masses, burning urination, or constipation. There was no history of weight loss or systemic symptoms such as fever or night sweats. The patient had no known comorbidities, and his medical, surgical, and family histories were unremarkable. He was not on any long-term medications, did not smoke, and reported occasional alcohol consumption. There was no personal or family history of IBD, connective tissue disorders, or dermatological conditions. The patient had been treated elsewhere conservatively for close to a 2 months duration.

      "findings_text": "In recent years, there has been increasing attention on radical surgical procedures for low rectal cancer that balance oncological safety with the preservation of anal function. In the early 1990 s, Schiessel introduced intersphincteric resection (ISR) for the treatment of low rectal cancer [ Based on the extent of sphincter resection, ISR is classified into partial ISR (PISR), subtotal ISR (subtotal-ISR), and total ISR (TISR). Correspondingly, the anastomosis site after coloanal anastomosis is located below the levator ani hiatus (PISR, near the dentate line; subtotal-ISR and TISR, below the dentate line). However, after low rectal total mesorectal excision (TME) and subsequent coloanal anastomosis, participants often face a high risk of anastomotic leakage and pelvic infections, which usually necessitates a protective ileostomy. The ileostomy helps divert fecal matter, providing a relatively low perfusion environment that promotes healing for ultra-low coloanal anastomoses. In case of an anastomotic leak, the protective stoma can mitigate infection and reduce the risk of secondary surgeries. However, complications from protective ileostomy, such as dehydration, chronic renal failure, and parastomal hernia, occur in up to 43% of cases [ In 1961, Turnbull and Cutait independently reported a surgical technique involving transanal pull-through rectal resection and delayed manual coloanal anastomosis [ In 2009, Remzi et al. conducted a retrospective analysis of 67 participants who underwent the Turnbull-Cutait procedure for various indications such as rectovaginal/urethral fistulas, anastomotic leaks, radiation proctitis, and rectal strictures. Compared to 88 participants undergoing standard coloanal anastomosis, the Turnbull-Cutait procedure (delayed anastomosis) significantly reduced the incidence of anastomotic leaks (3% vs. 7%) and pelvic abscesses (0% vs. 5%) without significant differences in defecation, urination, or sexual function [ Therefore, it is highly worthwhile to conduct a multicenter prospective randomized controlled study to determine whether this technique can serve as an effective alternative to ISR-coloanal anastomosis, achieving comparable or lower rates of postoperative complications, as well as equivalent oncological radicality and defecatory function. However, most research has focused on rectal cancers located higher in the rectum (requiring only TME) rather than specifically addressing ultra-low rectal cancers (which necessitate intersphincteric dissection, ISD) and there is limited data on its use in ISR\u2014an extreme sphincter-preserving surgical procedure for low rectal lesions [ This study targets participants undergoing ultra-low rectal cancer surgery, which requires internal sphincter dissection for sphincter-saving procedures.

Sacral canal nerve fascicular cysts were first reported by Tarlov in 1938, who conducted thorough and systematic research on them, hence they are also known as Tarlov cysts [ This 39-year-old Chinese woman patient presented with a 9-year history of progressive, recurrent, and recalcitrant sacrococcygeal pain, accompanied by discomfort in both lower limbs. In addition, she also reported a persistent sensation of anal distension. Her pain intensity was quantified as a score of 5 out of 10 on the visual analog scale (VAS). Notably, her symptoms were exacerbated during activities such as standing, walking, lifting, climbing stairs, and coughing, and they were not alleviated by resting in a recumbent position. Regarding the patient\u2019s medical history, she had no significant prior health issues apart from an abortion 2\u00a0years ago. However, she exhibited bowel and bladder dysfunction, characterized by altered sensation for urination and defecation. Specifically, she experienced frequent urination (10\u201315 times per day), urinary weakness graded as 1 point on the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) sphincter function score, residual urine, and severe constipation. Constipation symptoms are very severe, and the frequency of bowel movements is only once every 3\u20134\u00a0days, so laxatives must be used to help with bowel movements. Preoperative ultrasound examination further revealed a residual urine volume of 150\u00a0mL. During the physical examination, the patient exhibited limb muscle strength graded as 5, with a negative straight leg raising test (SLR test). The jugular compression test elicited sacrococcygeal pain accompanied by paresthesia. Sensory assessment revealed diminished pinprick sensation in the plantar region and S1\u2013S2 distribution.

The inclusion of symptomatic controls with gastrointestinal symptoms mimicking IBD but without evidence of the diagnosis provides a realistic diagnostic setting and addresses limitations of many previous cohorts. The use of healthy controls as a second control group offers opportunities to gain insight into IBD pathogenesis. The non-population-based study design and the predominance of university hospitals in recruitment may limit the generalisability of findings. Suboptimal sample processing at some centres, including delays in serum centrifugation and transportation of faecal samples at ambient temperatures, may have affected the quality of some specific analyses, such as microbiota analyses.  Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprising Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis and IBD-unclassified (IBD-U), is a chronic disease that predominantly presents during the second and third decades of life. The disease results in an impaired quality of life for patients and substantial societal costs due to sick leave and a high use of healthcare resources. IBD often presents with non-specific symptoms such as diarrhoea, fatigue and abdominal pain and, therefore, presents a diagnostic challenge. Commonly used biomarkers in diagnostic algorithms include C-reactive protein (CRP) and, in some regions, faecal calprotectin (FCP) which help identify patients needing referral for further investigations, including ileocolonoscopy. At diagnosis, the heterogeneity in clinical presentation and subsequent disease course make clinicians\u2019 attempts to stratify the treatment according to the individual patient\u2019s needs very difficult. While some patients experience an indolent disease course with minimal symptoms and low endoscopic activity, a substantial proportion exhibit an aggressive disease phenotype characterised by treatment refractoriness, corticosteroid dependency, frequent hospital admissions and surgical interventions, including resection surgery and acute colectomy.

After preoperative preparation, we made a paranal curved incision and found that the tumor was located in the sciatic-rectal fossa, the upper edge of the tumor was adherent to the puborectalis muscle, the lower edge was adherent to the internal anal sphincter, and the root of the tumor was in close proximity to the deeper part of the external sphincter muscle and the rectal wall, with a rich blood supply ( Photograph of the tumor during surgery. Tumor removal. Postoperative pathology. SMT, which were first described by Virchow in 1854 as benign tumors, SMT in the rectal and perianal regions have different growth patterns, namely, intraluminal, intramural, and extraluminal. Most SMT in the rectum grow intraluminally, and those in the perianal region tend to grow extraluminally due to their origins in the mucosal muscularis mucosae of the rectum, intrinsic muscularis mucosae of the intestinal wall, or internal sphincter of the rectal muscle, which is a continuation of the rectal muscle. In clinical work, the diagnosis of SMT should be differentiated from diseases such as gastrointestinal mesenchymal tumors and SMS, including PA and many mesenchymal tumors. PA is a common morbidity characterized by acute onset and severe pain that is often accompanied with chills and fever. SMS is a malignant tumor with abnormal cell morphology, no clear envelope, and the possibility of distant metastasis. Benign SMS usually present as well-defined, slow-growing, painless masses, whereas malignant SMS are fast-growing, may be associated with pain or ulceration, and have invasive and metastatic potential. Differentiation between the two usually relies on histopathologic examination, including features such as cellular anisotropy, nuclear division index, and necrosis. In our patient, after initial misdiagnosis, the diagnosis of a perianal SMT was finally confirmed. Based on preoperative CT, MRI, and intraoperative exploration, it was confirmed that the root of the tumor was located deep within the external sphincter at the level of the rectal musculature, growing outward into the lumen and encroaching upon the exte",

The patient had been experiencing these symptoms over the past 10 years. The patient was a non-smoker and non-alcoholic, and his family history was unremarkable. In 2008, the patient\u2019s symptoms were evaluated by infectious diseases and allergy/immunology services and he was diagnosed with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) due to his complaints of recurrent abdominal pain, bouts of diarrhea, joint pain, and continuous fever, in which his symptoms fit the Tel Hashomer criteria of FMF, yet there was no positive family history of first-degree relative with FMF. Colchicine 0.6 mg t.i.d. was initiated at that time, and follow-up revealed minimal symptom improvements.

Patients' clinical features, diagnostic challenges, and treatment strategies are discussed. Also, it focuses on the significance of surgical treatment as a key component of the treatment plan while also focusing on perioperative treatments to improve outcomes of patients with this rare cancer. A 53-year-old male patient presented with altered bowel habits and rectal bleeding. Investigations revealed rectal cancer, and the patient subsequently underwent low anterior resection (LAR) with ileostomy. During surgery, a perianal fistula located near the rectal adenocarcinoma and anus was discovered, raising suspicion of malignancy. A biopsy was taken from the fistula tract, followed by seton placement. Pathological examination of the rectal specimen confirmed well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, staged as T3aN0, with wide tumor-free margins. Furthermore, the fistula biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of MAC. Therefore, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) was recommended by our multidisciplinary team. Two months after NAC, the patient underwent an abdominoperineal resection (APR), perineal colostomy, and an antegrade colonic enema (ACE). However, the patient refused the placement of an ileostomy, so we closed it during a subsequent surgery. The pathology report revealed a T2N0 tumor with no margin involvement ( Baseline characteristics of patients, systemic and surgical treatments, and follow-up. APR: abdominoperineal resection; ACE: antegrade colonic enema. This procedure allows the patient to perform a complete colonic washout by flushing stool from the colon downward after inserting a water enema via a catheter. The patient was educated on how to irrigate the colon daily using one liter of water. This is likely to improve the patient's quality of life, enabling them to resume normal activities. This approach not only addresses the patient's medical needs but also preserves their body image and cultural sensitivities. Furthermore, the patient may experience reduced or absent soiling of undergarments. After surgery, the patient underwent adjuvant chemotherapy (AC). Twenty-nine months after surgery, a follow-up evaluation for recurrence of the tumor included a CT scan that demonstrated a distant metastatic nodule at the site where the perineal colostomy was embedded in the skin between the perineum and the colon. The pathology analysis confirmed that the metastatic nodule was adenocarcinoma related to MAC in a perianal fistula. Treatment included chemotherapy and local excision of the nodule. During a four-year follow-up period after diagnosis, no evidence of local recurrence or further metastases was observed, and the patient remains alive.

These conditions often require repeated assessments to guide therapeutic decisions, detect complications, and monitor treatment response. While endoscopy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remain the established standards for evaluation, they are limited by cost, accessibility, patient discomfort, and repeatability-particularly in scenarios such as pediatric care, pregnancy, or urgent outpatient settings. Transperineal ultrasound (TPUS), in contrast, offers a non-invasive, real-time, and bedside imaging solution that is repeatable, well-tolerated, and resource-efficient. In this context, TPUS has gained increasing attention as a non-invasive, real-time, and bedside tool capable of visualizing both structural and functional aspects of anorectal disease[ Despite its growing use, the role of TPUS in IBD remains under-recognized and inconsistently applied across clinical settings. Clinicians often lack clear guidance on its technical implementation, interpretation of findings, or how it compares with other imaging modalities such as MRI or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)[ In this review, we synthesize the current evidence and evolving applications of TPUS in IBD. We emphasize its potential as a frontline imaging modality in specific populations (children, pregnant women) and outpatient scenarios where rapid, repeatable, and radiation-free assessment is valuable. We cover its use in CD for the detection, classification, and monitoring of perianal fistulas and abscesses; in UC for assessing rectal inflammation; and in post-surgical pouch evaluation. We also highlight novel adjuncts such as Doppler imaging, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), 3D reconstruction, and computer-aided interpretation. By contextualizing these findings within clinical practice, we aim to clarify the utility, limitations, and future directions of this promising imaging modality. TPUS should begin with verbal consent, and the procedure is ideally performed in the presence of a female assistant when examining female patients. Bowel preparation is generally not required unless TPUS is scheduled on the same day as colonoscopy, in which case 1-2 L of polyethylene glycol solution may be used.

Perianal fistulas are among the most common and most difficult complications of CD, occurring in almost 10% of children at the time of diagnosis and over 20% later in the course of their disease. Little is known about how reliable perianal symptoms, such as anorectal pain and/or discharge, are for alerting clinicians to the presence of perianal lesions. Some evidence suggests that individual components obtained from the clinical history may not predict the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or particular disease features. On the other hand, physical exam findings, such as perianal lesions, may both help in diagnosing CD and predict disease complications, such as fistulas. To address this knowledge gap, we surveyed pediatric patients with CD undergoing colonoscopy regarding their perianal symptoms. We compared self\u2010reported symptoms with perianal exam findings at colonoscopy or recent physical exam findings to determine the reliability of perianal pain and/or anal discharge for predicting exam findings. Based on clinical experience, we hypothesized that perianal pain and/or anal discharge would poorly predict the presence of perianal lesions. As part of two prospective studies, we recruited pediatric patients, regardless of age, diagnosed with or suspected of having CD and who were scheduled to undergo colonoscopy for clinical indications at C.S.

Manifestations range from mild to severe multiorgan dysfunction, which can result in significant limitations for patients and their families [ Gastrointestinal (GI) involvement in lysosomal diseases can occur directly, due to substrate accumulation, or indirectly, due to the involvement of other systems, such as neuropathy and vasculopathy, or as a result of certain medications. The response to available treatments (enzyme replacement therapy, substrate inhibitors and chaperones) varies. In some cases, GI symptoms can be frequent and appear early, as in Fabry disease and Wolman disease. Recognizing these symptoms can help to avoid diagnostic delays. In other conditions, such as Niemann\u2013Pick type C and Gaucher disease, GI symptoms appear later in the disease course and indicate severe disease with an unfavorable prognosis. Understanding the pathogenic mechanisms in these cases can be useful for identifying appropriate treatment strategies. GI symptoms are often underdiagnosed, underreported or misdiagnosed as concomitant conditions due to their non-specific nature and lack of awareness among healthcare professionals. The aim of our review is to identify the main GI manifestations of LSDs, their pathogenesis and their treatment, in order to raise awareness of the more common forms and provide an overview of how to manage these rare manifestations. Specifically, we analyzed GI involvement in Fabry disease, Gaucher disease, Pompe disease, Niemann\u2013Pick type C, mucopolysaccharidosis and Wolman disease. Initially, acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), mucolipidosis, \u03b1-mannosidosis and fucosidosis were included in the search, but were later excluded due to a lack of evidence. GI manifestations affecting the liver or mouth (e.g., hepatomegaly or abnormal dentition) were excluded. Fabry disease (FD, OMIM #301500) is an X-linked storage disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme \u03b1-galactosidase A. This leads to the accumulation of glycolipids, such as globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and globotriaosylsphingosine (lysoGb3), in various cell types, including vascular, cardiac, renal, nerve and skin cells [ The classic form of FD manifests in childhood with symptoms including neuropathic pain, hypohidrosis, angiokeratomas, cornea verticillata and GI issues.

Cutting Seton insertion and endorectal advancement flap are among the common surgical procedures for high-type anal fistula because of the lower risk associated with recurrence of disease and fecal and gas incontinence.  In this retrospective cohort study, patients with trans-sphincteric high-type perianal fistula who underwent cutting Seton insertion or endorectal advancement flap procedures performed by the same surgeon (SVH) at Shahid Faghihi and Ghadir Mother and Child Hospitals affiliated with Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran, from January 2019 to January 2024, were included.  The inclusion criteria for this study were as follows: Suffering from trans-sphincteric high-type perianal fistula, the ability of the patients to provide written informed consent, the age range between 18 and 60 years, and a history of undergoing cutting Seton insertion or endorectal advancement flap surgeries within the past 5 years at the aforementioned medical centers. Suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases, diabetes mellitus, cytomegalovirus infection, malignancy, neurological disorders, previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy, history of previous anorectal surgery due to rectal cancer, history of perianal disease, changing Seton or using another procedure following the first surgery, and using steroids were the exclusion criteria.  The fistula diagnosis was performed via physical examination by the expert colorectal surgeon in our centers. All patients had soft drinks the night before the operation and received laxatives. The endorectal advancement flap procedure was performed while the patient was placed in a prone position after spinal anesthesia. By injecting methylene blue via the external orifice, the fistula tract, and the internal orifice were detected. Then, an appropriate probe was passed through the external orifice into the tract. The epinephrine solution was injected at a ratio of 1: 200\u2005000 to the submucosal of the flap area. The U-shaped flap was made by the elevation of the mucosa and submucosal of the rectum at the site of the internal orifice. The diseased area was removed, and the site of the internal orifice was sutured and closed with PDS 3-0.

      "findings_text": "\n Anorectal fistulas[ One major problem in diagnosing anorectal fistulas[ To overcome these diagnostic challenges, imaging methods have become more significant like low-spatial-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)[ Hydrogen peroxide-MRI (HP-MRI)[ In addition to obvious medical advantages there are many socio-economic benefits like with high accuracy HP-MRI could prevent repeated surgeries, which means lower healthcare cost. It also has improved the quality of patient\u2019s life by maximising the chance of addressing the fistula completely at the first attempt & reduced the physical and psychological burden on patients who often suffer from discharge, chronic pain & emotional stress. HP-MRI collect precise anatomical information to develop the most successful treatment solutions for anorectal fistula. This advanced imaging methodology surpasses conventional methods considering the high sensitivity and specificity of 96.08% and 90.91% respectively for identifying interior openings. It shows not only greater accuracy but also real socioeconomic advantages by shedding light on previously hidden branches, decreasing missed abscesses, and lowering recurrence rates overall. When it comes to assessing an anorectal fistula because it allows for a better visualization of the fistulous network. Fistulas that are recurrent or complex tend to have subtle internal openings and additional branches not captured through regular methods such as low spatial resolution ultrasounds or MRIs[ HP-MRI is an important milestone toward more precise, effective, and patient-focused treatment for anorectal fistulas. It overcomes the limits of traditional diagnostics, such as low-spatial-resolution MRI or ultrasound, by allowing for a more distinguished identification of complicated fistula pathways, branches, and accompanying abscesses. Because of its high sensitivity and specificity, fewer extensions are likely to be overlooked, which is crucial for avoiding recurrence and reoperations. For patients, Single surgical operations mean improved quality of life: Fewer complications, faster recovery, and less financial pressure. Integration of HP-MRI in today\u2019s medical industry is clearly in interests of hospitals and healthcare professionals & most importantly patients. Enhancing accuracy for the first diagnosis not only has straightforward medicinal benefits but decreases long-term expenses, embracing this cutting-edge technology is a necessary step towards advanced proctology and patient well being on a larger scale.

Treatment success requires surgical skill and a deep understanding of anorectal anatomy and its variations. Anorectal fistulas are characterized by an abnormal epithelialized connection between the anal canal or rectum and the perianal skin [ The management of anorectal fistulas has considerably evolved since ancient times. Contemporary surgical approaches have expanded beyond traditional fistulotomy to include sophisticated sphincter-sparing procedures, with technique selection heavily dependent on precise anatomical assessments. This evolution reflects a growing understanding of the critical balance between complete fistula eradication and preservation of anal continence. Recent studies have shown that inappropriate technique selection can lead to incontinence rates as high as 45% in complex cases. Parks' classification remains a cornerstone in surgical planning, categorizing fistulas into four types: intersphincteric, transsphincteric, suprasphincteric, and extrasphincteric [ Recent advancements in imaging techniques have significantly improved preoperative assessments. Modern imaging modalities, particularly high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 3-dimensional (3D) endoanal ultrasound (EAUS), now provide unprecedented anatomical details, with recent studies demonstrating accuracies of up to 98% in delineating the fistula anatomy. This enhanced imaging capability allows surgeons to plan more precise and targeted interventions [ This review aimed to provide practicing surgeons with a detailed anatomical framework for understanding fistula pathogenesis, practical strategies for managing complex and recurrent cases, and updates on emerging technologies and their anatomical implications. Various surgical management techniques have been evaluated using an anatomical lens. Traditional methods, such as fistulotomy, have a success rate of 92\u201397% for simple fistulas but carry a risk of incontinence in up to 45% of cases of complex fistulas [ We emphasize the importance of a tailored approach to fistula management, based on individual patient anatomy and fistula characteristics.

The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the People\u2019s Hospital of Liuyang (No. 2023-013). Since the MRI examinations require the intravenous injection of the contrast agent gadopentetate monoglucoside (Gd-DTPA), patients signed an informed consent form for the contrast injection prior to the MRI scan, and also provided consent for any surgeries or related procedures beforehand. This is a retrospective study, and an application to waive the requirement for informed consent for the retrospective collection of data was approved by the medical ethics committee after review. We initially retrieved 203 cases of anal fistula from the picture archiving and communication systems (PACS, Diagnostic imaging workstation; Neusoft Corporation, Shenyang, China). Following the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 168 patients with confirmed diagnoses of anal fistula were recruited in the Radiology Department of the People\u2019s Hospital of Liuyang between November 2021 and November 2023, and all cases were assessed using MRI. The inclusion criterion was clinically diagnosed anal fistula that was subjected to MRI examination within seven working days before surgery. The clinical objective was to \u201ccure while preserving anal function\u201d. Treatment options were selected or combined based on the specific condition of the patient and can be categorized into surgeries that damage the sphincter and those that preserve sphincter function. The former category included procedures such as fistulectomy, fistulotomy, and the use of cutting setons, whereas the latter included the ligation of the intersphincteric fistula tract (LIFT) procedure and the endorectal advancement flap, among others. The exclusion criteria were as follows: patients with Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) resulting in fistula, hidradenitis suppurativa, septic sweater, atypical infected lesions with anal fistula formation [in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis (TB), and actinomycosis], immunocompromised patients (e.g., neutropenic patients undergoing chemotherapy to treat solid-organ malignancies, or patients with hematological malignancies) ( Flow diagram of this study.

      "findings_text": "We read with great interest the article by Abbas et al. [ The authors performed a  FPR was initially described by Parkash et al. [ FIPS and FPR are conceptually similar surgical procedures with comparable outcomes, but it is important to recognize that they differ technically. In FPR, a fistulectomy is performed, involving the complete removal of the fistula tract. In contrast, FIPS involves a fistulotomy, where the fistula tract is merely opened, cleaned, and curetted without completely excising its posterior wall. Technically, a fistulotomy is easier to perform than a fistulectomy. Initially, there was concern that performing a fistulotomy without sphincter repair and without fully excising all tracts might lead to increased septic complications and recurrence rates. However, these concerns were mitigated by the findings of Litta et al. [ In the study conducted by Abbas et al. [ Over the past 15 years, several gadget-based sphincter-sparing procedures have been introduced, including video-assisted anal fistula treatment (VAAFT), fistula-tract laser closure (FiLac), fixcision, anal fistula plug (AFP), over-the-scope clip (OTSC), and stem cell treatments. However, their success rates in treating high complex fistulas are not promising, ranging from 25% to 65% [ The 3 cardinal principles are ISTAC (intersphincteric tract acts like an abscess in a closed space), DRAPED (drainage of all pus and ensuring continued drainage in the postoperative period till complete healing occurs), and HOPTIC (healing occurs progressively till it is interrupted irreversibly by a collection) [ ISTAC implies that a fistula tract in the intersphincteric space, confined by 2 anal sphincter muscles, behaves similarly to an abscess and should therefore be drained and treated as such. DRAPED highlights the necessity of evacuating pus and maintaining effective drainage until complete healing is achieved. HOPTIC indicates that the healing process is ongoing unless it is halted or permanently obstructed by an accumulation of pus or serous fluid. A surgical procedure adhering to these 3 principles is likely to be highly effective in treating complex fistulas. Conversely, ignoring these principles may result in lower success rates [ Once these principles are understood, it becomes clear why recent gadget-based sphincter-sparing procedures (VAAFT, FiLac, fixcision, AFP, OTSC, etc.) yield poor outcomes in treating high complex fistulas. These procedures fail to adhere to the ISTAC principle, which involves addressing the intersphincteric portion of the fistula tract; instead, they focus solely on managing the external tracts and the internal opening. Consequently, most simple fistulas, which typically lack a significant intersphincteric portion, see a moderate success rate of 50% to 75% with these procedures. The ligation of intersphincteric tract (LIFT) procedure addresses the ISTAC principle by opening and cleaning the intersphincteric tract and space. However, it neglects the se",

      "findings_text": "The anal fistula is an epithelialized tract connecting the perianal skin to the anal canal. In China, anal fistula accounts for 1.67% to 3.60% of anal and intestinal diseases, second only to hemorrhoid. Cutting seton (CS) is the mainstream operation for patients with high anal fistula, though it has drawbacks such as hanging pain, long recovery period, anal sphincter function damage, and extended hospital stay. In 2017, Garg first described the transanal opening of the sphincter space (TROPIS) procedure based on the mechanism of intersphincteric infection, achieving a 91.4% cure rate in high-complex fistulas. To address these issues, we have developed a new procedure, the cutting of the intersphincteric space (COIS). This approach opens the sphincter infection through an intermuscular approach and provides full visibility of the surgical space. Tunnel stripping is then performed on the lateral aspect of the external sphincter to facilitate complete eradication of necrotic tissue and wound drainage. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of COIS in treating high anal fistula compared with CS. This was a single-center, randomized controlled trial. The study was conducted in the Anorectal Department of Nanjing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine from January 2021 to January 2023. The hospital ethics committee approved the protocol of the study (KY2020070), and all patients provided written informed consent. The study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trials Registry (ChiCTR), with the registration number of ChiCTR2100041746. The study flow diagram is shown in Figure  Study flow chart.

Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the COIS or CS group using a random numbers table. This study was carried out under unblind conditions. Before the operation, detailed history taking, system examination, anorectal pressure measurement, and continence assessment were conducted. All patients underwent a preoperative MRI scan or endoanal ultrasonography to assess the type and branching of the fistula tract.

Although the majority of anal fistula in adults originates from cryptoglandular infection, its management remains a clinical challenge because of its diversity in presentation and complexity [ The distinction between simple and complex anal fistulas remains a topic of significant discussion [ The main goal of surgical intervention for anal fistula is to eliminate sepsis and promote healing of the tract, preserving the sphincters and continence of the patient [ Accurate identification of the underlying cause of recurrence and navigation through the altered anatomy after surgery requires advanced techniques and a personalized approach. The alternatives available for the treatment of anal fistula, especially in complex and recurrent cases [ Both fistulectomy and fistulotomy are widely used surgical procedures in the management of anal fistulas. Fistulectomy involves complete removal of the fistula, including surrounding infected tissue, to prevent recurrences. On the other hand, fistulotomy consists of incising and draining the fistula, leaving the wound open to heal. The choice between fistulectomy and fistulotomy depends on factors such as the location and complexity of the fistula, as well as the surgeon\u2019s experience and preference [ In recent years, various sphincter preservation techniques have been proposed to minimize injuries and optimize functional results in the treatment of anal fistula [ Non-thermal plasma (NTP), a significant advancement in current medicine, has become a crucial tool in wound healing, redefining medical standards with its effectiveness in various areas, such as dentistry [ This study aimed to enhance medical care in the treatment of anal fistulas and explore new therapeutic perspectives. The efficacy and safety of NTP in the postsurgical treatment of anal fistulas were investigated, focusing on fistulectomy and fistulotomy surgeries. A direct comparison was made between applying NTP in both procedures to evaluate its effectiveness. This analysis considered parameters such as postoperative recovery time, pain levels, wound healing time, and potential adverse reactions including dehiscence, bleeding, infections, and other complications.

The BCM is an integral part of the EAS, and the muscle in its entirety is appropriately named \u201canogenital muscle.\u201d The muscle plays a dual and synchronous role in fecal control and sexual response ( Due to this relationship, the reasons for sexual function impairment in patients with perianal fistula are better understood. This study was designed to investigate the effects of perianal fistula surgery on quality of life and sexual dysfunction using standardized and validated questionnaires. This was a prospective study with a cross-sectional survey design. It was approved by our local Ethics Committee and all patients provided their written informed consent. We enrolled patients prospectively, from those presenting consecutively, with perianal fistula disorder at the General Surgery Departments of Gazi University Faculty of Medicine between 2017 and 2022, and 18 patients were also excluded since they had a history of irritable bowel syndrome, anal fissure, anorectal abscess, inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, and a history of any major psychiatric disorder/treatment and treatment with immunosuppressive drugs. All patients underwent examination of the anorectal region including an external exam, digital rectal exam and anoscopy and/or rectosigmoidoscopy, and pelvic magnetic resonanse imaging as part of diagnostic workup at the outpatient clinic where indicated. Patients with chronic anal fistula were classified according to the Modified Park Classification (intersphincteric, transsphincteric, suprasphincteric, and extrasphincteric fistula;  Sexual functions were evaluated with the IIEF scale.

Studies show the recurrence rates for anal fistula surgery range between 5 and 50%, with up to a 40% rate of fecal incontinence leading to significantly diminished quality of life [ This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. All patients aged 18 or older with a primary or recurrent cryptoglandular anal fistula between 2011 and 2019 who underwent surgical repair at one of two academic medical centers within a single healthcare system were initially included in this study. Additional inclusion criteria included identification of both external and internal os and a definitive repair operation. Patients were excluded if there was missing data of type of fistula or surgery, if the fistula was determined to be non-cryptoglandular in origin (i.e., Crohn\u2019s disease, HIV, malignant neoplasm, obstetrical trauma, or other organ involvement included colovesical, diverticular, and rectovaginal), if the only management was a non-definitive repair such as a draining seton, or if no fistula was identified. All surgeries were performed by colorectal surgeons within the health system. This study was performed under the approval of the University of Pittsburgh institutional review board, protocol STUDY19070137. Intraoperative findings, surgical repair, and outcome data were collected from the electronic medical record or patient reported outcomes. Anal fistulas were classified as simple or complex fistula. Simple fistulas were comprised of intersphincteric, or low/very low transsphincteric fistulas. Complex fistulas included mid/high transsphincteric and suprasphincteric. The primary outcome was recurrence of fistula by clinical exam finding. Fistula recurrence was defined as the identification of at least one fistula os (internal or external) or high clinical suspicion of anal fistula based on clinical exam with associated regular drainage and pain. Presence or persistence of the anal fistula at 6\u00a0months from the definitive repair surgery was noted to be failure of healing. If the fistula had healed but was identified more than 6\u00a0months after the initial surgery, it was determined to be a recurrent fistula. If a fistula was found in an unrelated location from the treated fistula, it was categorized as its own entity instead of a recurrence. Secondary outcomes included fecal incontinence defined by the Wexner score and postoperative quality of life defined by the fecal incontinence quality of life (FIQL) scale.

Anorectal fistulas are chronic inflammatory disorders affecting the peri-anal tissues that join the perineal skin and the anal canal [ There are several potential causes of anal gland infection or fistula formation, including inflammatory bowel disorders, pelvic sepsis, diabetes mellitus, cancer, perineal trauma, and congenital factors [ Inflammation in the intersphincteric plane is common in cases of anal gland sepsis. It progresses along the intersphincteric plane to the perianal skin, a phenomenon found in approximately 70% of fistula cases. Another sort, transsphincteric fistulization, incorporates the infection going through the two layers of the butt-centric sphincter and the ischiorectal fossa; this occurs in around 20% of cases. Fistulous plots might bring about sore pits anyplace along their course; ischiorectal fossa abscesses are common in transsphincteric fistulas. Suprasphincter fistulization happens when infection sidesteps the sphincter complex and enters the ischiorectal fossa. Likewise, extrasphincteric or translevator fistulas might create assuming infection spreads from the pelvis to the skin through the ischiorectal fossa. Even after surgery that seems to be effective, there is a notable tendency for some fistulas to have recurrence rates of up to 25%. Often, the recurrences are the result of untreated infections from the original operation that were missed [ For a long time, the imaging method for anorectal fistulas was traditional fistulograms. Using this technique, the exterior opening is first accessed, and then the fistula is injected with a water-soluble contrast. There are two significant drawbacks to this strategy. First, when the primary tract and its extensions are blocked by pus or debris, the area is not completely visible because the area does not fill with contrast. Secondly, the sphincter muscle anatomy is not imaged [ Even though fistula in ano is not evaluated using computed tomography (CT), its poor soft tissue distinction and restricted imaging capability limit the accuracy of fistula classification. The attenuation values of the sphincter muscles, fibrotic areas, and fistula tract are comparable to each other, which limits the use of CT fistulography [ Milligan and Morgan first proposed the surgical classification of anal fistulae in 1934, and Stelzner and Goligher later modified it [ The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a diagnostic and preoperative assessment tool for fistula in ano has led to substantial breakthroughs in imaging methods, with MRI interpretations agreeing with surgical results in 14 of 16 instances [ The accuracy with which MRI shows the anatomy of the perianal area has been shown by Charles et al.

      "findings_text": "Cutting setons have been used since Hippocrates. The cutting seton technique is based on the assumption that it causes an inflammatory reaction which stimulates fibrosis around the seton, preventing the sphincter from retraction when slowly divided. Unlike \u2018laying open\u2019 of the fistula tract, this technique should preserve optimal continence. Today, the use of cutting setons is controversial because of the significant patient discomfort after tightening and the wide range of reported incontinence rates [ Alternatively, a seton can be placed through the fistula tract and left loose without tightening, facilitating drainage. This loose seton technique is often applied prior to definitive repair and is also used as a palliative measure aimed to control symptoms and avoid formation of new abscesses. It is believed that long-term loose seton drainage causes distal migration of the fistula tract [ The aim of the present study is to assess the occurrence of distalization of trans- and suprasphincteric perianal fistulas after loose silicone seton drainage. Consecutive patients undergoing loose silicone seton placement for the management of a trans- or suprasphincteric fistula between January 2016 and December 2021 who met the inclusion criteria were studied retrospectively. Inclusion criteria were magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 3\u00a0months before loose seton placement and MRI after loose seton placement. In our centre MRI\u00a0is routinely performed for assessment of perianal fistulas. Exclusion criteria were seton replacement after seton loss instead of primary seton placement and surgery between seton placement and MRI. The height of the external anal sphincter (EAS) and the level of penetration of perianal fistula through the EAS or puborectal muscle (PRM) were determined on pre- and postoperative MRI (Fig.\u00a0 Measuring external anal sphincter\u00a0 length and level of penetration.  Primary outcome was migration of the fistula tract through the EAS and PRM. The level of penetration of the fistula was divided by the EAS height to determine the proportion of muscle involved.

Mak et al. [ The surgical management of pCD most commonly consists of the drainage of sepsis with or without seton placement, and sometimes subsequent removal [ Studies of reparative surgery in pCD focus largely on minimally invasive techniques that avoid the division of the sphincter complex.

Meta-analyses have found that success and recurrence rates in pCD are around 61 and 18%, respectively [ Less-well-studied minimally invasive techniques take various forms, generally involving cauterizing the internal surface of the tract, or scraping and then filling it. The Video Assisted Anal Fistula Treatment (VAAFT) achieves cautery under direct vision through cannulation of the tract with a rigid fistuloscope; however, studies on patients with pCD are scarce [ Despite (or perhaps due to) the wide range of procedures available for definitive treatment, most surgeons adopt a conservative approach [ However, there is evidence to suggest that a combination of medical and surgical treatment results in improved healing rates over either treatment alone [ There has been a recent shift towards addressing these deficiencies in pCD research, with several multi-center RCTs being conducted to examine the efficacy of various surgical and medical treatments. In doing so, these trials have revealed several important issues to consider in optimizing patient management and in undertaking pCD research.

Anal fistulas affect approximately 0.01% of the population. They are more common in men in their fourth decade, which is two- to four-fold compared to women ( In some cases of males with anal fistulas, the fistulas can extend into the scrotum. The presentations are variable in those cases. The scrotum usually presents with redness, swelling, pain, and pus discharge from the external opening, while anal symptoms may be absent or minimal ( Goodsall's rule for predicting the trajectory of anal fistulas is popular; however, the long-tract anterior fistula, which may include fistulas with scrotal extension, is an exception to this rule ( According to our best knowledge, this is the first study about the role of MR in the preoperative evaluation of anal fistulas with scrotal extension. We conducted this study to elucidate the MR characteristics of anal fistulas extending to the scrotum, the rules applicable to them, and to correlate MR features with surgical findings. A total of 150 consecutive patients with anal fistulas extending into the scrotum who were diagnosed and underwent surgery at the University Medical Center, Ho Chi Minh City between January 2017 and April 2022 were included in this study. All included patients underwent preoperative MRI examination with intravenous contrast. The exclusion criteria were (a): patients having recurrent fistula, or (b) their operative records were not detailed ( Diagram of patient inclusion and exclusion.

The MR protocol consisted of the following pulse sequences: sagittal T2-weighted (T2W) turbo spin-echo (TSE), oblique coronal T2W TSE with fat saturation (FS), and oblique axial T2W TSE with the imaging planes oriented orthogonal and parallel to the axis of the anal canal, respectively. The parameters for these T2W sequences were repetition time (TR) 3,000\u20135,000\u2005ms, echo time (TE) 75\u201385\u2005ms, field of view (FOV) 20\u201325\u2005cm, turbo factor (TF) 17, slice thickness 3\u20134\u2005mm, intersection gap 0.6\u20130.7\u2005mm, matrix 320\u2009\u00d7\u2009256 (for the sagittal and coronal plane) or 320\u2009\u00d7\u2009320 (for the axial plane), number of signals acquired (NSA) 2.

Current treatments attempt to target multiple pathophysiological aspects including infection, epithelialization, inflammation, cellular senescence, and nonhealing. Autologous fat grafting (AFG) has been shown to improve the healing potential of complex wounds including chronic scars, burns, and ulcers\u00a0 Using a prospectively maintained, IRB-approved database, we performed a retrospective review of patients undergoing AFG treatment for anal fistula at a single academic institution from December 2016 to November 2021. Data gathered included demographics, procedural history, medications, operative details, and clinical outcomes. Outcomes included rates of symptom improvement, clinical or radiologic closure, recurrence, complications, and worsening fecal incontinence. Patients undergoing a planned staged closure were excluded from fistula closure rate analysis. Patients with a stoma were excluded from fecal incontinence rate. Perianal disease activity index (PDAI) scores were obtained for patients who underwent combination AFG and fistula plug treatment as part of a clinical trial (IIT-2017\u201310,082 treatment of perianal disease using adipose-derived stem cells). Pre-procedure PDAI was obtained within 8\u00a0weeks of surgery and post-procedure PDAI obtained at 3-month follow-up. Clinical improvement was defined as decrease in pain and drainage having significant impact on patient quality of life. Clinical closure was defined as resolution of all fistula drainage and local sepsis including no perianal pain, no seton, and visual closure of the external orifice on perianal exam. Recurrence was defined as persistence of the fistula 3\u00a0months after intervention or significant enough fistula symptoms prior to the 3-month end point to require a seton placement. Subgroup analyses were performed examining differences in outcomes based on number of procedures, IBD status, fat preparation method, diversion, and internal orifice management.

Proponents argue that the culture of pathogenic microorganisms is necessary not only to predict the likelihood of fistula formation after anorectal abscess surgery but also to guide the precise use of antibiotics and prevent antibiotic resistance ( The lack of a systematic comparison of microbial differences and source-tracking analysis of anorectal abscesses provided the rationale for conducting this study. We hypothesized that patients with anorectal abscesses have a different gut microbiota but similar perianal buttock skin flora to that in healthy individuals. We further investigated the relationship between the gut, pus, and perianal buttock skin microbiota in patients with anorectal abscesses to assess the potential role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis, development, and prognosis of anorectal abscesses. We recruited 60 consecutive patients with anorectal abscesses (AA group) who underwent surgical treatment at the Department of Anorectal Surgery of Yangzhong People\u2019s Hospital between October 2023 and June 2024, and 26 healthy individuals of matched sex and age who were confirmed by the hospital\u2019s Health Screening Center during the same period to serve as a healthy control group (HC group).

In contrast, RUF secondary to radiation therapy rarely close spontaneously, warranting immediate surgical intervention. Conservative management typically involves urethral catheterization aiming for spontaneous closure of the fistula [ In this paper, we present our 13-year experience with the York\u2013Mason technique for surgical management of RUF in RARP patients, highlighting outcomes and specific considerations. The York\u2013Mason is a posterior transsphincteric approach that provides direct access to the fistula through healthy tissue, with precise layer-by-layer closure of the sphincter complex. A single-center retrospective cohort study was conducted at the Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital\u2014Netherlands Cancer Institute (AVL-NCI). The study was approved by the institutional review board of the AVL-NCI (IRBd19-248) and conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki [ We retrospectively analyzed PCa patients who underwent a York\u2013Mason for RUF following RARP at AVL\u2013NCI between January 2011 and May 2024. Patients of all PSA values and tumor stages were included. The following variables were collected for each patient: age (years), clinical tumor stage (cT-stage), radiological tumor stage (mT-stage), Gleason score in biopsies, history of radiotherapy (prior to or following RARP), pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND), noted surgical comments, pathological tumor stage (pT-stage), pathological nodal stage (pN-stage), R0 status, date of RUF diagnosis, diagnostic method for RUF, treatment for RUF, date of York\u2013Mason procedure, noted comments about the York\u2013Mason procedure, surgeon performing the York\u2013Mason procedure, and reported functional outcomes after the York\u2013Mason procedure. Bowel function after colostomy reversal was assessed using the Low Anterior Resection Syndrome (LARS) score. The LARS score consists of five questions evaluating aspects of bowel function: control of flatus, incontinence for liquid stools, frequency of bowel opening, clustering of stools, and urgency. The total score ranges from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms of bowel dysfunction.

Around 15\u201335% of patients presenting with an anorectal abscess develop a fistula-in-ano, which occurs more commonly in adult males than females [ We hypothesize that fistula recurrence may be traced back to persistent undrained collections with retained infected anal crypt gland. For instance, while the LIFT procedure ligates the fistula tract, the internal opening with infected gland remains, and intraluminal pressures have not been relieved. Therefore, we believe that optimal management of a transsphincteric fistula should include three components: (1) cauterizing the infected crypt gland to eliminate the source of the abscess formation, (2) widening and externalizing the internal opening to allow for healing via secondary intention, and (3) debriding the abscess cavity and fistula tract from the internal opening to the external opening. We therefore propose the modified TROPIS; the original approach was first described by Pankaj Garg in 2017 [ The author and colleagues performed a retrospective study evaluating the healing outcomes of patients with transsphincteric fistulas, who were treated with either modified TROPIS or the LIFT procedure. This is an Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective study at an academic teaching hospital. All 36 patients with confirmed mid or high transsphincteric fistula were thoroughly debriefed on the procedure and provided full informed consent to participate in the modified TROPIS study. The modified TROPIS procedures were performed from January 2020 to September 2023. These results were compared with our previous study data of 24 patients who received LIFT procedure and underwent operation from January 2011 to May 2013, which was presented at the 2015 ASCRS meeting [ In our practice, patients are advised to maintain a clear liquid diet for 24\u00a0h prior to surgery and take one enema the morning of surgery. We also advise patients to discontinue all drugs that can prolong bleeding (e.g., coumadin, aspirin-containing medications, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).

Today, over half of all rectourethral fistulae reported are secondary to radiation therapy, brachytherapy, or cryoablation for the treatment of prostate cancer. However, fistulae may also result from inflammatory bowel disease, trauma, or pelvic surgery. Though the management of rectourethral fistulae has evolved, there has been a continuous emphasis on classifying fistulae as  To this end, the use of the gracilis muscle flap to provide healthy intervening tissue after fistula takedown has become an accepted reconstructive method. It was first described by Ryan et al Although the benefits of gracilis muscle flap interposition reconstruction have been described, refinements are helpful to optimize its use. Due to the relative rarity of the formation of complex rectourethral fistula, the literature on the indications for repair with gracilis muscle interposition is sparse. A prior study within our institution analyzed outcomes of rectourethral fistula repair before and after the implementation of a multidisciplinary treatment algorithm. This algorithm was developed in 2012 through analysis of an institutional database of patients with rectourethral fistula. Plastic surgery involvement was indicated for (1) irradiated fistulae less than 3\u2009cm or (2) nonirradiated fistula greater than 2\u2009cm or with an unfavorable proximal location. Nonirradiated fistulae less than 2\u2009cm underwent primary urologic repair. Irradiated fistulae greater than 3\u2009cm and patients with poor rectal tone were referred for pelvic exteneration. However, results of complex fistula repair including gracilis muscle interposition were not thoroughly investigated. A retrospective quasi-experimental study was previously conducted which analyzed clinical outcomes of rectourethral fistula repair at a single institution between 2001 and 2022. Surgical management of these patients followed 1 of the 3 paths: paracococcygeal transrectal transsphincteric (York-Mason) repair, transperineal repair with gracilis flap interposition, or pelvic exenteration with permanent urinary and fecal diversion. Starting in 2012, a multidisciplinary algorithm (Fig.  Uroplastic treatment algorithm for rectourethral fistula (RUF) reconstruction. Adapted with permission from Hayden et al.

Techniques employed include fistula laser-assisted closure, insertion of fistula plugs or glue, and video-assisted anal fistula treatment (VAAFT) [ To address these challenges and offer an effective, minimally invasive approach, ovine forestomach-derived extracellular matrix (ECM) may be useful [ Our findings indicate that for both superficial transsphincteric and intersphincteric FIAs, surgical management with the insertion of ovine ECM into the fistulas preserves the structure and complexity of the natural ECM during healing. This approach also provides biological cues that facilitate tissue regeneration and promote angio-conduction. Postoperative healing was confirmed by endoanal ultrasound (EAUS), which showed minimal scarring associated with the intersphincteric fistulas. Fistulas are first examined under general anesthesia in the lithotomy position, with a perianal regional block applied using 20 mL of 2% bupivacaine. An example of FIAs, including one at the 6 o\u2019clock position (transsphincteric) and another at 7 o\u2019clock (intersphincteric) is shown in  To assess the postoperative healing of the tract, EAUS can be utilized 1 month after surgery. In our patient, EAUS revealed the resolution of the longer 7 o\u2019clock intersphincteric tract without appreciable hyperechoic scarring, indicative of healing through regeneration of the surrounding native parenchyma. A small residual internal opening of the shorter 6 o\u2019clock superficial transsphincteric tract likely corresponded to minor scarring where the internal stitch was placed for closure. The low-lying, shorter FIA of the 6 o\u2019clock intersphincteric tract remained patent ( This study was approved by the Centralised Institutional Review Board of SingHealth (No. 2020-2525). Written informed consent for publication of the research details and clinical images has been obtained from the patient. Throughout history, the management of FIA has been technically challenging, with surgical techniques exhibiting varying levels of reproducibility and success [ Beyond the likely anti-inflammatory properties of ovine ECM, the described technique may also prove beneficial in treating complex FIA among patients with inflammatory bowel disease. This approach could reduce inflammation associated with the disease and promote the regeneration of innate mesenchymal stem cells within the tract. Consequently, it could offer an alternative in acute cases, including those with concomitant abscess, relative to the current standard practice of staging drainage with definitive surgery. While the use of ovine ECM in fistula management has no absolute contraindications, we would generally avoid employing this method with fistulas that are complex with multiple branching tracts, are short and narrow (which increases",

This study was approved by the ethics committee of Shuguang Hospital Affiliated with Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Study Approval No. 2023-1270-27-01). Written consent was obtained from all patients who were informed about the procedure. Inclusion criteria were patients aged \u226518 years presenting with HTAF. HTAF was diagnosed in accordance with the Parks classification ( All patients underwent MRI before surgery to delineate the HTAF tracts and their anatomic relationship with the sphincter. This imaging was used to facilitate accurate identification of the internal opening and tracts, thereby providing direction for surgical planning ( Preoperative MRI.

The duration of intravenous anti-inflammatory drugs was determined according to the severity of the anal fistula and the length of the hospital stay. Iodophor cotton slivers were used to clean the wound and were placed at the intersphincteric plane for drainage 2 times a day until the wound healed.

Local calprotectin levels could predict fistula phenotype, and consequently disease prognosis, potentially offering a fundamental rationale for a tailored treatment approach in daily clinical practice. Crohn's disease (CD) is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) characterised by immune\u2010mediated chronic inflammation that affects primarily the gastrointestinal tract. Clinical differentiation between CD and cryptoglandular perianal fistulas may sometimes be a challenge. In roughly 10% of patients, fistulas are the first sign of Crohn's disease and may precede the typical manifestation of intestinal inflammation by several years. Most fistula classification systems are predominantly based on anatomy and do not take fistula characteristics into account. The new TOpCLASS classification system identifies patients according to disease severity and disease outcome and helps towards more tailored treatment. Fistulas classified as 2a are suitable for repair. In contrast, class 2b designates fistulas unsuitable for repair, where the treatment goal is symptom control. Patients in class 2c, present with progressive fistulas, are destructive to the perineum or quality of life and are heading towards defunctioning. However, as this system is merely based on descriptive characteristics, it could benefit from a more objective parameter. The aim of the current study was to prospectively validate the previous findings on FC and analyse if increased local fistula tract calprotectin levels are associated with (prognostic) fistula characteristics resulting in increased FC levels. This study was a prospective single\u2010centre study conducted at the Amsterdam University Medical Centres, location AMC.

      "findings_text": "An anal fistula is an abnormal connection between the epithelialised surface of the anal canal and the skin, representing one of the most common conditions affecting the anus. The primary cause of an anal fistula is infection and abscess formation. Inadequate drainage or spontaneous rupture of the abscess results in fistula formation. Less frequently, fistula formation can occur secondary to inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease, haemorrhoidal surgery, chronic anal fissures, malignancy, or radiation therapy [ According to Park's classification, anal fistulae are categorised into inter-sphincteric, trans-sphincteric, supra-sphincteric, and extra-sphincteric types. The choice of treatment depends on the location of the fistula tract and the position of the internal opening within the anal canal [ Treatment for perianal fistulae is predominantly surgical, aiming to eradicate the infection and cure the fistula while preserving the anal sphincter. The dual objectives of resolving the fistula and maintaining continence present a significant challenge for surgeons, as fistulous tracts can encircle varying amounts of the sphincter complex [ The AFP has emerged as a promising alternative to open surgery for treating anal fistulae. First described\u00a0in 2006, it has demonstrated a significantly higher healing rate compared to fibrin glue [ The AFP is composed of biological materials, including acellular dermal matrix and submucosa derived from the porcine small intestine (Surgisis fistula plug (Biodesign,\u00a0Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN), as well as new bioabsorbable synthetic materials (BIO-A fistula plug, Newark, DE) [ This study aims to assess the outcomes and complications associated with the management of high perianal fistulae using the FBP technique. The primary anticipated outcome is the healing of the fistulous tract, characterised by the absence of fistulous discharge, closure of the external opening, and the absence of perianal abscesses. Secondary outcomes include the patient's continence status and the time required for healing and closure of the fistula.

      "findings_text": "Fistula-in-ano (FIA) is an intriguing problem of the anorectal region in the general population. A patient\u2019s first visit and precise surgical management in the initial phase play a crucial step in the healing of the fistulous tract. Fistulectomy is among gold-standard procedures practiced for ages\u00a0[ The prevalence in the general population varies greatly; in various European nations, it ranges from 1.04 to 2.32 cases per 100,000 people\u00a0[ Risk factors for FIA include obesity, diabetes, impaired immune systems, low socioeconomic position, smoking, hyperlipidemia, and a sedentary lifestyle [ For FIA management, various methods have been recommended and detailed, such as fistulectomy, fistulotomy, and the use of cutting seton. The arsenal of these therapeutic options has lately expanded to include newer procedures, including fibrin plug, anal fistula plug, fistula laser closure (FiLaCTM), ligation of inter-sphincteric fistula tract (LIFT), and video-assisted anal fistula therapeutic (VAAFT). Due to anal sphincter injury, surgical treatment of FIA has a high risk of fecal incontinence and a large chance of recurrence. The risk of incontinence is associated more with the proximal location of the internal opening in the anal canal\u00a0[ Since the previous surgical treatments had a significant risk of recurrence and fecal incontinence, a number of innovative procedures with minimal morbidity and great patient satisfaction have been developed\u00a0[ There is no link between FIA and mortality; however, there is a strong correlation with morbidity. Chronic side effects, such as fecal and gas incontinence, recurrence, and anal canal stenosis, affect patients after therapy. The anatomic classification and surgical technique of the FIA\u00a0will determine whether it will recur or not. Fibrin glue was first introduced in the 1990s and was thought of as a good idea for closing fistula tracts since, acting as an occlusive substance, it has a low risk of incontinence because it spares sphincteric damage. Fibrin glue showed a lot of promise for successfully sealing anorectal fistulae with few problems, but newer data reflect that the success rate had dropped from 80% in the early years to less than 50% [ There are four types of tissue adhesives, which are biomimetic, synthetic, natural protein-based, and hybrid. N-butyl 2-cyanoacrylate (n-BCA), octyl cyanoacrylate (OCA), and 2-octyl cyanoacrylate (2-OCA) are the different types of cyanoacrylate glue. Cyano helps in binding protein, acrylate helps in polymerization, and a combination of both leads to tissue healing. The term \"cyanoacrylate\" is based on the cyano, ethylene, and various alkyl groups [ A variety of techniques are being applied these days to treat anorectal fistulae, but none of them are without drawbacks, including incomplete healing, large perianal incisions or scars, incontinence, and recurrence\u00a0[ In many ways, cyanoacrylate glue appears to be another good alternative cure for FIA.

The main cause is that the rectum and anal canal are invaded by inflammation, which causes perianal tissue to fester and form a fistula. If the fester invades the part above the sphincter, it is called high anal fistula. This investigation was conducted as a randomized controlled trial with a double-arm design and repeated measurements from October 2021 to October 2022. The trial aimed to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of the RCTD technique against the arc incision internal drainage (AID) method. Specific outcomes of interest included improvements in operation-related conditions, complication rates, anal function, recurrence rates 6 months postoperation, and changes in microbial flora. Assessments were carried out at 2 points: baseline and after the surgery. The AID method was applied to the control group, while the RCTD technique was utilized for the experimental subgroup. The selection and disqualification of participants were assessed based on predefined criteria. Following evaluation, eligible participants were randomly allocated to the study groups. The inclusion criteria included: (1) individuals aged between 18 and 60 years; (2) patients meeting the diagnostic standards for high posterior horseshoe anal fistula as referenced Before surgery, all necessary diagnostic tests were completed. On the day of surgery, patients were required to fast, abstain from drinking water, and undergo gastrointestinal cleansing. Following intraspinal anesthesia, subjects from both groups were positioned on the operating table, where standard sterilization procedures were implemented, and sterile drapes were placed. In the experimental group, the RCTD technique was executed. Initially, the direction of the fistula was identified using methylene blue staining. A probe was then inserted through the fistula\u2019s external opening, guiding a radial incision made at the anus\u2019s posterior midline down to the depth of the fistula probe. This allowed for the determination of the pathogen\u2019s trajectory. The internal opening of the anal fistula was incised, and both the internal sphincter below the dentate line and the superficial part of the external sphincter were sequentially incised, extending 1 to 2\u2009cm towards the anal margin. Contaminated and necrotic tissue within the anal canal was removed with a curette, and the incision was shaped into a \u201cV\u201d for optimal drainage. Subsequently, tunnel floating line drainage was performed; the internal opening was radially excised, the posterior incision\u2019s fistula wall was scraped and cleaned, the lumen was irrigated, and a rubber strip was placed between the 2 incisions to adjust the tightness.

      "title": "Deep Postanal Abscess With Sacrococcygeal Osteomyelitis: A Case Report",
      "clinical_history": "",
      "findings_text": "Deep postanal abscesses (DPAs) are complex conditions that challenge clinicians due to their location, diverse symptomatology, and difficulties in surgical management. The deep postanal space is defined as the area bounded anteriorly by the external anal sphincter (EAS) complex, posteriorly and inferiorly by the coccyx and anococcygeal ligament, and superiorly by the levator muscle [ The primary goal in managing a DPA is to drain the abscess, eliminate the focus of sepsis, and, if possible, treat the fistula tract. Based on Courtney's theory, open surgical methods, such as the Hanley procedure or modified Hanley procedure, have been widely used to treat deep posterior anal fistulas, as well as techniques such as seton placement or flap advancement. Managing DPAs and related fistulas requires careful evaluation, a strategic approach, and extensive proctological experience. In this case report, we aim to share our treatment details and follow-up on a case of DPA accompanied by osteomyelitis. Such a local sequel of DPA has not yet been reported in the literature. A 43-year-old male patient with no comorbidities presented with ongoing coccygeal pain radiating to his back and his thighs. A digital rectal examination revealed a painful swelling in the proximal anal canal. A loose seton had been placed on the left lateral side at another hospital. Contrast-enhanced pelvic MRI was planned with a preliminary diagnosis of anal abscess. Laboratory tests revealed a leukocyte count of 7.8 x 10\u2079/L, with neutrophils 5.12 x 10\u2079/L. The patient had received oral ciprofloxacin and metronidazole treatment for four weeks at an external center prior to presenting to us. Therefore, we only evaluated the preoperative values upon admission. Since these values were within the normal range due to prior antibiotic use, we did not find it necessary to recheck the laboratory parameters. The patient had no fever or any septic signs. The MRI images revealed a 5x3 cm lesion consistent with an abscess in the deep anal fossa, with accompanying osteomyelitis at the S4-S5 localization (Figure  A: On the sagittal short tau inversion recovery (STIR) image, intramedullary hyperintensity consistent with osteomyelitis was observed on the opposite surfaces of the sacral 4-5 vertebrae. Inflammatory hyperintense soft tissue thickening was also noted in the presacral fat tissue. B: On the post-contrast T1 fat-saturated transverse image, an abscess formation containing air with an irregular enhancing wall was seen in the midline-left side of the presacral area, and enhancement consistent with osteomyelitis was noted in the adjacent bone. The previously placed seton was apparently not draining the abscess cavity. The patient was operated on under spinal anesthesia and sedation. In the prone jackknife position, an incision was made on the posterior midline, extending to the coccyx, to reach the posterosuperior part of the external anal sphincter muscle.

      "clinical_history": "",
      "findings_text": "Acquired ano-rectal fistulas and sinuses are a prevalent condition, with a higher incidence reported in the male population [ Typically, these cases are identified when patients present with perineal pain or discharging cutaneous openings. However, certain patients may remain asymptomatic or exhibit atypical symptoms, leading to delayed diagnosis and progression to more advanced stages of the disease [ Although the anatomical proximity of pelvic genito-urinary organs to the ano-rectal region theoretically predisposes them to involvement, such cases are rarely documented in the literature. This rarity is attributed to natural anatomical barriers, including the mesorectal fascia, fascia of Denonvilliers, Colle\u2019s fascia, Buck\u2019s fascia, and the perineal diaphragm, which act as protective structures preventing the extension of fistulas and sinuses into adjacent pelvic organs. In this article, we present a series of four cases demonstrating the extension of advanced ano-rectal fistulas and sinuses into pelvic genito-urinary structures. This series highlights the diverse clinical presentations, the role of MRI in diagnosis, and the subsequent surgical management strategies employed in these rare and complex cases. Anatomical considerations and etiopathogenesis The anal canal is surrounded by the internal and external anal sphincters, which consist of smooth and striated muscles, respectively. The external sphincter is posteriorly attached to the ano-coccygeal ligament and anteriorly attached to the perineal body and urogenital diaphragm (and bulbocavernosus muscles in men) and continues proximally with the puborectalis muscle (which marks the ano-rectal junction), which in turn, merges with the levator ani muscles. The internal sphincter is formed by the distal circular muscle of gastro-intestinal tract [ The proximal half of the anal\u00a0canal contains longitudinal mucosal folds, the anal columns of Morgagni. The distal aspect of each column is linked to its neighbor by a small semilunar fold (the anal valves), which in turn forms small pockets (the anal sinuses, or crypts of Morgagni). At the distal undulating end of these valves is the dentate (pectinate) line, which also marks the most distal aspect of the anal transitional zone, a histologic junction between the anal squamous epithelium and rectal columnar epithelium. The dentate line lies approximately 2 cm proximal to the anal verge and is a crucial landmark since the anal glands empty into the crypts that lie proximal to the valves. The origin of the anal glands within the surrounding tissues is variable. They may be present in the subepithelium or the internal sphincter, and approximately one- to two-thirds of these glands are deeply seated within the intersphincteric space (Figure  We hereby state that Figure  It is believed that infection of these results in the formation of anorectal sinuses and fistulas, in a process known as the \u201ccryptoglandular hypothesis\u201d [ The anatomy of the male pelvis alo",

Since Hippokrates described his pioneering treatment with a cutting thread through the fistula tract (what was later meant to be the \u201cseton\u201d procedure), one could say that many things have changed, but all remain the same [ Concerning fistula classification, several systems have been proposed since Parks introduced his well-established, nowadays, classification system [ Contemporary surgical approaches for complex anal fistulas still have the Seton method as a reference point, and many of the new ones would very much like to have the results of this method while also adding the best sphincter preservation. Even though new methods share the philosophy of the golden ratio between definitive treatment and anal continence, none of them has proven to be ideal. Although anal fistulas have been widely studied and various mechanisms of pathogenesis have been proposed, we still seem to be in shallow waters regarding their exact mechanisms of pathophysiology. In this study, we presented four different cases of anal fistulae that have been treated by this method of PRPs. Materials and methods PRP A total of 20mL of whole blood was acquired up to five days preoperatively from the patients. After adding citrate-phosphate-dextrose solution (CPD), first centrifugation at 270g for seven minutes was done to collect the plasma, and then a second at 1000g for five minutes to collect the platelet fraction.\u00a0After these steps, the supernatant was discarded, and the platelet fraction was placed at -80\u00b0C for 30 minutes to lyse the platelets and release the growth factors. After leaving the specimen at room temperature for some minutes, one final centrifugation at 1000g for five minutes was carried out, and the supernatant was collected.

The choice between incision and drainage (I and D) alone or combined concurrent fistulotomy remains highly controversial. Proponents of the combined procedure argue that, based on the cryptoglandular infection theory, most anorectal abscesses would inevitably recur or develop anal fistulas after I and D alone, which can only be prevented by I and D combined with concurrent fistulotomy, thus avoiding reoperation[ Currently, anorectal abscesses are described according to their anatomical locations: (1) Ischiorectal; (2) Intersphincteric; (3) Supralevator; and (4) Submucosal abscesses[ Through years of clinical observation, we found that fistula-prone abscesses (FPAs) have an extremely high rate of recurrence or fistula formation after simple I and D, while non-FPAs (NFPAs) exhibit a substantially lower rate of recurrence. This suggests that this new classification of anorectal abscesses is reasonable. Therefore, this retrospective study was conducted to test this hypothesis and provide the basis for this new classification. Furthermore, we aimed to identify other risk factors that might predict recurrent anorectal abscess to guide the choice of surgical procedure. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Yangzhong People's Hospital (No.  Clinical data from outpatients and inpatients diagnosed with anorectal abscesses, treated with I and D alone in our hospital (a tertiary general hospital) from August 2012 to July 2022, were collected.

The patient presented with a swollen, painful lump on the right buttock (1 cm \u00d7 1 cm) that was found after a long ride 5 years ago. The pain subsided after 2 days of rest. However, the swelling and pain recurred and were sometimes relieved by self-medicating with cefixime. Owing to worsened swelling and pain after a long ride 3 years ago, the patient sought medical help at a local hospital and was subsequently diagnosed with a perianal abscess. The pain was relieved by topical drugs but recurred every 2 months. The abscess began to spread upwards. Six months after topical drug treatment, the symptoms of the perianal abscess began to recur more frequently, approximately 2-3 times per month, and were not relieved by conservative treatment. The patient used to have good physical condition, and denied chronic diseases like hypertension, diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease. Surgical history was deniable. The patient and his family denied any history of infectious and hereditary diseases, smoking, alcohol consumption, major trauma and blood transfusion, or food or drug allergy. The patient was admitted for physical examination at the anus. The appearance of the anus was still flat. The sacrococcygeal region on the right side was 4 cm \u00d7 6 cm away from the anal truncus and a 3 cm \u00d7 3 cm hard mass was palpable, with weakly positive tenderness, normal skin temperature, and no obvious fluctuating sensation. Finger-pointing of the anus identified an anal verge at the 6 o\u2019clock, 5 cm vertically away from the anus, located in the depression of the hard inner mouth. The right posterior rectal ring was hard without blood staining in the retracted finger. No directly relevant laboratory tests for reference. Ultrasonography of the perianal area using a high-frequency probe revealed a subcutaneous hypoechoic area on the right side of the sacrococcygeal area extending to the posterior anus, suggesting the presence of a high complex anal fistula. Hypoechogenicity was observed in the lateral sphincter at the six o'clock position of the anorectal ring, extending deep into the plane between the internal and external sphincter above the six o'clock position of the anorectal ring and spreading to the seven o'clock position on the right and five o'clock position on the left. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed the following: (1) Strip-like high-signal shadows on T2-weighted images at the five o'clock position of the perianal area in perianal lithotomy that inferoposteriorly extended into the right ischiorectal fossa, where two branching fistulas descended posteriorly on the right side; (2) An external opening situated subcutaneously in the right buttock; (3) Flocculent and nodular shadows near the right ischiorectal fossa and ",

Following the oncological principles of en\u00a0bloc resection, an abdominoperineal resection (APR) with partial or complete excision of the posterior vaginal wall is often necessary, even after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. For small defects in the posterior vaginal wall, primary closure may be an option, although this has the risk of dehiscence or narrowing, especially after radiotherapy. Larger vaginal wall defects have to be closed with well-vascularized tissue, to enable healing of the vagina as well as the adjacent perineal wound, thereby minimizing the risk of chronic pelviperineal abscess and fistula formation. To date, myocutaneous flaps, such as the gracilis flap, rectus abdominal muscle (RAM) flap, gluteal maximus flap, and fasciocutaneous gluteal perforator flaps, are the most frequently described autologous tissue flaps to reconstruct the posterior vaginal wall and close the perineum [ The gluteal turnover flap comprises the neighboring skin and subcutaneous tissue of one buttock, which is perfused by vessels perforating the superficial fascia of the gluteus muscle. It involves minimal dissection, carries a negligible risk of flap failure, and enables midline closure without donor site scar [ From March 2021 until November 2023, patients who underwent an APR for primary or locally recurrent rectal cancer and whose tumor invaded the posterior vaginal wall requiring an en\u00a0bloc resection were identified.

A 66-year-old man with complex Crohn\u2019s disease, diagnosed at age 32, attended gastroenterology clinic for routine review in November 2017. He had a medical history of gastro-oesophageal reflux. Previous surgical intervention included a right hemicolectomy with terminal ileal resection and synchronous proximal jejunal resection at age 40. This was complicated by psoas abscess requiring repeat laparotomy, washout and drain insertion. At clinic review, he had a symptomatic colovesical fistula, which was initially diagnosed at age 54, two perianal fistulae, initially diagnosed at age 61, and an intermittent enterocutaneous fistula in the right iliac fossa at a previous drain site. He also had chronic anal canal stenosis, requiring anal dilatation in the past. While he remained intermittently symptomatic from the fistulae at clinic, there were no complications requiring hospital admission and his symptoms were medically managed as an outpatient with full patient compliance. His medications included azathioprine 50\u2009mg three times per day, alendronic acid 70\u2009mg once weekly, calcium carbonate and colicalciferol D3 tablets two times per day, lansoprazole 15\u2009mg once daily and hydroxocobalamin injections every 12 weeks. At the time of surgical clinic review, he had received his second infusion of infliximab. His main complaints at clinic were worsening of symptoms relating to his fistulae.

Only a handful of cases are described in the literature, which have been mostly managed with open sigmoid colectomy. This case was successfully managed laparoscopically. Usually, presentations of peri-anal abscess proceed swiftly to examination under anesthetic (EUA). This case highlights the need to consider extra-levator causes of peri-anal abscess and to have low threshold for early imaging. It also demonstrates a good outcome through first managing the sepsis, then proceeding with a laparoscopic approach to definitive surgical management once the disease was quiescent. A 55-year-old male presented with a 1-month history of perianal swelling with increasing discomfort. Other than malaise, he remained systemically well. He reported 3 months of intermittent abdominal discomfort, thought to be related to constipation, which had resolved by the time of his presentation. He had no prior history of perianal abscess and had a medical history that was significant only for conservatively managed diverticulitis, with a recent colonoscopy confirming mild disease. On peri-anal examination, there was fullness and tenderness over the right ischiorectal space. The tenderness extended from 9 to 11 o\u2019clock ~4\u00a0cm from the anal verge. No external opening was obvious, and there were no masses on per rectal exam. His abdomen was soft and non-tender.

An ischiorectal cavity was found with small amount of purulent material. No fistulae into the rectum were identified. Further imaging was considered at thistime. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) identified a fistulous tract extending from the sigmoid colon, around the anterior aspect of the anal canal, with small collections in the ischiorectal and ischioanal fat. CT fistulogram showed a long fistulous tract extending from the right peri-anal region to a sigmoid diverticulum above the recto-sigmoid junction ( ( Fistulogram of colocutaneous peri-anal fistula.

They occur from blockage or infection of anal crypts and glands due to chronic constipation, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD; Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis), malignancy, foreign bodies, and sexually transmitted diseases [ A 57-year-old male presented to the ED with diffuse pain vaguely located at the lower abdomen over the previous 24 hours. He was awake and alert and did not complain of pain in any other site. His past medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), gout, myocardial infarction and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There was no history of constipation or perianal inflammation. He was a heavy smoker, his body mass index was 45 kg/m Written informed consent for publication of the clinical images was obtained from the patient. Deep spreading perianal abscesses represent one of the most morbid entities in anorectal disease. Their rarity and insidious clinical manifestations can lead to delayed diagnosis, severe sepsis, and death. Comorbidities, such as IBD, heart disease, obesity, or DM, raise the risk of complications [ Retroperitoneal abscesses usually originate from the genitourinary tract, may be idiopathic or postoperative, and infrequently involve other organs like the colon, duodenum, and pancreas. Traditionally, lumbar incision was proposed for treatment, with the transperitoneal approach being the least successful, in an overall mortality background of 26% highly associated with critically ill patients and delayed diagnoses [ Anatomically, the supralevator space is a pelvic compartment above the levator ani muscle that communicates anteriorly with the space of Retzius, bilaterally with the retroinguinal spaces, and posteriorly with the retroperitoneum. The puborectalis muscle acts as a barrier to expanding abscesses. However, abscesses can rarely appear above or inside the muscle, usually along with a fistula, allowing the spread of inflammation through both anterior and posterior extraperitoneal abdominal compartments. The therapeutic plan is vast, and many approaches have been proposed. Percutaneous intersphincteric drainage for limited supralevator abscesses is more difficult, and even fluoroscopic monitoring of the abscess often has inadequate results and might prolong sepsis [ We identified 7 previous cases of anorectal abscesses that fulfilled our criteria of expansion through imaging and clinical presentation ( Despite their rarity, extended anorectal abscesses should be considered in differential diagnosis for a septic patient with multiple comorbidities. Immediate resuscitation, CT imaging, and definite intervention are necessary for proper diagnosis and treatment. Expansion of inflammation is unpredictable and can occur in various anatomic planes.

He presented with fever, cramping lower abdominal pain and severe pain around the area of the buttocks. The physical examination revealed tenderness upon deep palpation of the right lower abdominal quadrant with no evidence of peritoneal irritation. An extensive perianal surgical wound was revealed, indicating the previous drainage procedures were performed through bilateral ischioanal incisions. No pathology of the scrotum and groin was observed. The digital rectal examination provoked severe pain and was not diagnostic. The laboratory studies showed leukocytosis (white blood cells number, 18.000/\u03bcL; neutrophils, 97%) and an increased level of C-reactive protein (CRP, 30 mg/L). The computed tomography (CT) scan, which was performed 5 days prior to presentation, demonstrated a posterior horseshoe abscess and inflammation of the right pararectal space. Due to the patient\u2019s indolent clinical presentation, the complex perianal surgical wound and the persistent fever despite the multiple drainage procedures, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lower abdomen and pelvis was performed. As a new finding, an abscess cavity was revealed in the right supralevator space ( Initial resuscitation with crystalloids and intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics was followed by an examination under general anaesthesia. Prior to induction of general anesthesia, the patient received counsel regarding the emergency procedure, and written informed consent was obtained.

Neither an additional surgical wound to the perineum nor a posterior midline sphincterotomy were performed.

      "findings_text": "Perianal fistulas are frequent manifestations of Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) and cause significant morbidity, often with serious impairment of the patient\u2019s abilities. Fistulas are abnormal communications formed by granulation tissue and are established between two epithelial surfaces. Perianal fistulas form between the inner surface of the anal canal (internal opening) and the skin (external opening). These fistulas are the main, but not the only, manifestation of perianal CD (PCD). Their treatment is difficult and sometimes requires colostomy or even proctectomy, although this does not resolve the problem in all patients. Although CD-associated perianal fistulas only account for around 1% of all perianal fistulas [ Perianal fistulas seem to be caused by different pathogenetic mechanisms than enteric fistulas. In fact, up to 80% of patients with PCD do not have enteric fistulas [ Imaging techniques provide information on the anatomical and functional aspects of fistulas, which are often difficult to obtain through clinical examination, especially in patients with inflammation or abscesses. In addition, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) makes it possible to evaluate the presence or absence of healing of the deep tissues of the fistula paths, a key aspect in the follow-up of patients. MRI and ultrasound (US), both endoanal and transperineal, are imaging methods that show the anal anatomy in detail. They allow the clinician to assess the extent and complexity of disease as well as the presence of abscesses; such information is essential in choosing the most appropriate treatment. The higher anatomical resolution of these methods also contributes to successful surgical outcomes by decreasing the risk of incontinence or other complications. Unfortunately, this grade of precision cannot be achieved by other imaging methods such as fistulography or computed tomography. Importantly, correct evaluation of patients with PCD should include an endoscopic study to evaluate luminal disease, specifically the condition of the rectum; a local imaging study, either MRI or US; and an examination under anaesthesia, during which abscesses can be drained, seton stitches can be placed in situ, and other necessary measures can be undertaken [ Several scientific societies and groups of experts are clearly committed to MRI for the study of PCD.

A vast majority of patients have involvement of the small bowel, particularly the terminal ileum. Nearly half of all patients have some involvement of the colon. Patients typically experience diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, and fever. Patients with colonic involvement also suffer from lower gastrointestinal bleeding and perianal complications.[ Supportive laboratory data to diagnose CD include elevated serum inflammatory markers such C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum albumin, alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor, and some fecal markers such as fecal calprotectin.[ Confirmation with an endoscopic procedure with specimen sampling is often performed using ileocolonoscopy, which provides only limited access to the small bowel. Video capsule endoscopy can be used to visualize the entire length of the small bowel but does not have the provision of tissue sampling and is contraindicated in patients with strictures or bowel obstruction. While mucosal disease is well-assessed with endoscopic techniques, submucosal and serosal/mesenteric disease as well as intraabdominal complications cannot be evaluated. Description of the disease severity, exact location, and associated complications is necessary for appropriate clinical and surgical management. Traditionally, barium studies have been performed to evaluate the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract, but are now used less frequently due to poor sensitivity and specificity. Computed tomography (CT) remains a common clinical tool in the evaluation of CD and its complications. Because CD patients often undergo multiple studies over the course of diagnosis, they can be exposed to a high cumulative effective dose of radiation.[ Magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) is a radiation-free alternative to CT and is extremely useful in the management of CD. Usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as an effective modality to evaluate type and severity of inflammatory bowel disease and its comparability with endoscopy has been studied for the past two decades.[ When compared to conventional endoscopy, MRE has a sensitivity and specificity of 85% and 80%, respectively,[ When compared to enteroclysis, MRE has lesser sensitivity for detecting superficial ulcers due to inadequate distention.[ High diagnostic accuracy between high resolution MRE and surgical/histopathologic specimens in a series of 49 patients with CD was recently established in a study by Sinha  Fasting 4\u20136 hours prior to the examination is recommended in order to improve tolerance of oral contrast. Some authors have advocated the use of rectal enema the morning of the examination because fecal burden obscures colonic disease.

Imaging plays a supplementary but important role in both the early and chronic stages of the disease, aiding in the characterization of active lesions, assessment of the extent of involvement, and the recognition of complications. The use of advanced imaging modalities such as MRI, the modality of choice, has greatly aided in the management of these patients. To our knowledge, there has been limited discussion of HS in the radiology literature. We present a case report of a 56-year-old man with known diabetes mellitus and a 10-year history of HS and highlight through MR imaging findings, the relentless natural progression of the disease, characterized by recurrent exacerbations of abscesses and fistulae and complications of perianal fistulae and sacral osteomyelitis.

Abdominoperineal resection (APR) is advocated in the vast majority of patients to definitively remove the entire lesion and lessen the risk of local recurrence. Local resection is sometimes performed, but only in cases where the tumor margins can be confidently excised without damage to the anal sphincters. In order to prevent local recurrence, the APR has to be performed with wide local excision of both perianal soft tissue and the overlying skin. Recently locally advanced rectal cancer has been considered an indication for preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Preoperative CRT for rectal cancer has been shown to increase the probability of tumor resectability and to decrease the rate of local recurrence [ The aim of this article is to report a rare case of large perianal mucinous adenocarcinoma, arising from an anorectal fistula, successfully resected after preoperative radiotherapy. A 60-year-old man with a 45-year history of perianal fistula who had recently been suffering from mucinous discharge, pain and perianal induration was referred to hospital for treatment. Two years before, he had undergone surgery at another institution for incision and drainage of recurrent perianal abscess. Physical examination revealed an indurated, ulcerative lesion 7 cm in diameter with an external anal fistula opening (fig.  To increase resectability and decrease the rate of local recurrence, preoperative radiotherapy was proposed without chemotherapy because of the renal dysfunction.

[ A retrospective review of all patients who underwent this intersphincteric procedure for DPA space sepsis from February 2008 to October 2010 was performed. Only patients with abscesses and fistulas of cryptoglandular origin were included in this study. All patients underwent preoperative endoanal ultrasonography (EAUS) to confirm the presence and the extent of the pathology ( Following preoperative bowel preparation using a sodium-phosphate enema, the patients were placed in the prone jack-knife position after the induction of general anaesthesia. An Eisenhammer anal retractor was first inserted into the anal canal and the intersphincteric groove was identified. A 2- to 3-cm curvilinear skin incision was made posterior to the intersphincteric groove as guided by the preoperative EAUS. A Lone Star Retractor System (Cooper Surgical, Trumbull, CT, USA) was then placed, and the incision was deepened using electrocautery. The intersphincteric space was developed in a cephalad direction, and the indurated intersphincteric tract/tissue on the lateral surface of the internal sphincter was identified ( Irrigation of the DPA cavity and its extensions was then performed before placement of a Redivac suction drain (Medinorm, Quierschied, Germany) into the DPA cavity to facilitate continual drainage. Approximation of the internal and the external sphincter muscles and the skin was performed using 4/0 polyglactin sutures. The infected tissues from the DPA space were sent for culture and sensitivity tests. All patients were discharged with a one-week course of oral antibiotics (amoxycillin-clavulanate or ciprofloxacin and metronidazole) and were reviewed by the senior author in the outpatient clinic one week following surgery.

However, the unique physiological and anatomical structures of the anal canal and surrounding tissues pose significant challenges for postoperative tissue repair. Surgical procedures often result in substantial tissue damage, including necrotic tissue formation, which complicates the healing process. The mechanical stress of postoperative defecation can further hinder tissue repair by expanding the wound and disrupting the regeneration of the affected area. Delayed or incomplete healing is a frequent outcome, contributing to chronic inflammation, prolonged recovery periods, and an increased risk of recurrence. Addressing the limitations of tissue repair in the context of anal fistulas is therefore critical for improving surgical outcomes [ Insulin\u2010like growth factor\u20101 (IGF\u20101), primarily produced by the liver and locally synthesized by various cell types such as fibroblasts, osteoblasts, and keratinocytes, plays a vital role in tissue repair and regeneration [ Notably, IGF\u20101 has been implicated in enhancing the regenerative capacity of epithelial and connective tissues, which are key components involved in the healing of anal fistulas [ Given its critical functions in tissue repair, this study aims to investigate the prognostic value of preoperative serum IGF\u20101 levels in patients undergoing incision\u2010thread\u2010drawing surgery for anal fistulas.

These cases often arise from intentional acts and can occur for a variety of reasons, including sexual gratification, psychiatric disorders, or accidental ingestion [ Radiologic imaging plays a critical role in establishing the diagnosis and treatment plan in these cases. Although direct radiography is usually the first choice for the detection of RFBs, advanced imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) may be required for detailed anatomic evaluation and determination of complications [ This case report discusses the evaluation, diagnostic process, and treatment of a patient who had a \"sausage\" lodged in his rectum. Food-related RFBs are rarely reported in the literature, and this case provides valuable insights for healthcare professionals managing similar conditions in similar cases. A 67-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department complaining of perianal pain. The patient stated that he drank a lot of alcohol alone at night and did not remember anything. When he awoke in the morning, he reported severe pain and redness in the pelvic and anal areas, a sensation of fullness in the rectum and anus, and swelling in the suprapubic area. On further questioning, although he could not remember anything, he stated that something may have been inserted into his anus. He stated that he was not accompanied by anyone when he drank alcohol at night. The patient had no comorbidities other than hypertension and no diagnosed psychiatric illness. A physical examination of the patient revealed redness of the perianal skin. The external anal sphincter tone was decreased, and a rectal palpation revealed the presence of a small, hard object distal to the rectum and a larger, soft material just above it. In addition, a palpable and tender swelling was observed on the abdominal wall at the suprapubic level. Consequently, the patient underwent an abdominal roentgenogram, which yielded a preliminary diagnosis of a foreign body in the rectum. This was followed by an abdominal CT scan with contrast to visualize any potential complications.

Notably, conventional preoperative assessments including digital examination and basic laboratory investigations failed to detect the cystic lesion, highlighting the diagnostic limitations in complex perianal pathologies. This observation aligns with existing evidence demonstrating 69% to 81% healing rates depending on fistula complexity, This first documented case of anal fistula associated with infected perianal cyst expands our understanding of recurrence mechanisms in anal fistula. The findings emphasize the necessity of meticulous intraoperative exploration and suggest considering cystic lesions in the differential diagnosis of refractory fistula cases.

Furthermore, reducing the pelvic dead space is believed to reduce the risk of future small bowel obstructions by preventing bowel loops from adhering to raw surfaces in the recently operated pelvis. The vertical rectus abdominus myocutaneous flap (VRAM) is a standard flap used for perineal reconstruction.

The inclusion criteria were as follows: adult patients aged >18 years, clinically diagnosed with CD and confirmed to have an intra-abdominal fistula by computed tomography enterography (CTE) or magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) as verified and reported by an abdominal radiologist. Patients were excluded if they were aged <18 years, had no diagnosis of CD, had no radiological evidence of internal fistula on CTE or MRE, or were lost to follow up within three years of their diagnosis. For the study, imaging studies were reread and evaluated for the following radiological indicators of CD: type and number of fistulae, length of disease segment, stricture with pre-stenotic dilatation (defined as a narrowing of 50% or more of the intestine lumen), and presence of an abscess.

In mild cases, hemorrhoids prolapse during defecation but retract spontaneously. If uncontrolled, manual reduction is necessary. Severe cases involve prolapse triggered by increased abdominal pressure (e.g., coughing, sneezing, exertion) that is difficult to reduce. Surgery becomes necessary when conservative treatments fail. The procedure for prolapse and hemorrhoids (PPH) is a common surgical approach for treating grade III and IV internal hemorrhoids and mixed hemorrhoids. PPH offers advantages over traditional surgery in managing outlet obstructive constipation caused by internal rectal prolapse with circumferential hemorrhoids ( Procedure for prolapse and hemorrhoids causes less surgical damage, making it suitable for elderly patients and those with rectal mucosal prolapse. It facilitates quicker recovery and reduces recurrence for patients with a history of traditional surgery ( Day surgery is an emerging treatment model in which patients complete hospitalization, surgery, and discharge within 24 h. This model is increasingly adopted in modern medical practice ( This study included 107 patients with mixed hemorrhoids who underwent day surgery PPH at Changhai Hospital between October 2021 and July 2023, along with 234 patients who underwent non-day surgery PPH between April 2008 and April 2023.

Minimally invasive approaches, such as endoscopic placement of stents, clips, Thus, the development of new biomaterials capable of noninvasively occluding and sterilizing fistula tracts is needed. Despite efforts to establish animal models that replicate ECF, none have successfully mimicked the pathological features of human ECFs, such as their complex anatomy and associated infections. Given these challenges and the absence of ongoing trials for novel therapies, we aimed to develop a multifunctional biomaterial designed to promote ECF healing and mitigate associated complications. Considering the multifaceted pathological features of ECF, the ideal biomaterial should provide efficient occlusion, strong adhesiveness, antimicrobial properties, biodegradability, and biocompatibility. Hydrogel\u2010based sealing agents hold promise for the occlusion and healing of fistulous tracts due to their high water content and structural and physicochemical properties, which resemble the natural extracellular matrix, providing an ideal environment for cell survival and tissue regeneration. Gelatin, derived from collagen, is one of the most widely used natural polymers for tissue regeneration due to its ability to promote cell adhesion, differentiation, and proliferation. Here, we introduce ECFGel, an injectable, X\u2010ray visible, antimicrobial, tissue adhesive, and biodegradable hydrogel composed of gelatin, O\u2010Dex, ionic liquid (IL), and iohexol (IOH), designed for the treatment of ECF ( Schematic illustrating the multifunctional capabilities of ECFGel in treating ECF.

      "findings_text": "Crohn's disease is a chronic, immune\u2010mediated disorder of the gastrointestinal tract, that is characterized by a relapsing\u2010remitting course with heterogeneous phenotypes. Perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease represents one of the most aggressive and debilitating forms of Crohn's disease, characterized by abnormal connections between the rectum or anal canal and adjacent tissue, occurring with an estimated prevalence of 14%\u201343%. The impact of this condition can be detrimental to a patient's quality of life, with increased severity of symptoms and an overall poor prognosis. The management of perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease is a major clinical challenge due to its refractoriness to medical treatment despite recent advancement in targeted therapies, as many patients still require surgical intervention [ Detailed evaluation of the fistula tract is essential to determine the optimal management strategy and to assess responsiveness to initiated therapies. Here, magnetic resonance imaging has established itself as the reference standard to assess the anatomy, the degree of inflammation and treatment response in Crohn's disease associated fistula tracts [ In the current issue of the  Altogether, this is a convincing pilot study addressing a currently unmet need in Crohn's disease, as objective evaluation of fistula tract response to initiated therapies still remains a challenging task. Various studies have indicated that fistula healing identified by MRI is a valuable outcome measure, as it is associated with prolonged period of clinical remission [ Some limitations of the presented study need to be acknowledged, which include the retrospective study design, the unicentric setting, the small sample size of included patients and the limited follow\u2010up time. Further data regarding the timing of observed volumetric changes between initiated therapies and differing outcomes concerning the type of treated perianal fistula would provide valuable further insights for prospective validation of this novel diagnostic procedure. Furthermore, differentiation of fibrotic and active components based on signal intensity on T2 sequences should be validated against histological analyses of the investigated fistula tract. This diagnostic method should ideally also include outcomes for both perianal and internal fistulae. Reduction in the volume of the active component of the fistula should also be correlated with newly proposed patient\u2010reported outcome measures, such as the Crohn's Anal Fistula Quality of Life scale [ Nevertheless, this study is of great value compared to the available literature, notably by being the first to assess volumetric changes of active and fibrotic components of the fistula tact and positively correlating it with clinical response to therapy. Overall, decrease in the active component in 3D volumetry on MRI might represent a valuable biomarker for defining therapeutic targets of treatment of perianal fistulizing disease, thereby addressing an ",

Simple wounds often heal within 30 days, while complex or contaminated wounds may become chronic. Robot-assisted surgery for rectal cancer is safe and now an important surgical technique for rectal procedures. Rectal surgery after a severe perineal tear may be associated with scarring and fibrosis around the rectum, and precautions should be taken during rectal dissection. We could safely perform rectal surgery after 4 months; however further research is required to determine the optimal timing for surgery, considering factors like the tumor condition.

One study reported that among 1284 patients of anal fistula and PNS, six patients had PNS communication with fistula in ano [ In this case, the patient was treated with interception of the fistulous tract and MIKKT. We present a case of recurrent PNS communicated with fistula-in-ano in a 27-year-old female and the subsequent surgical management based on Ayurvedic principles. A 27-year-old female arrived at the Shalya Tantra Outdoor Patient Department (OPD), reporting a non-healing wound at the natal cleft area and pus discharge from the wound persisting for two months. The patient reported undergoing two surgeries for PNS; the first, a year ago, an excision of the PNS tract was done, and the second surgery with flap technique was done three months ago. Despite the two-month duration after the second surgery, effective wound healing did not commence, and the condition persisted unchanged. On Physical Examination, the patient was fair, well oriented to time, place and person and vitals were within normal limit. Local Examination: On local examination, the wound of previous surgery presented at the natal cleft region, and the secondary pit was 3 cm away from the wound with the scar mark of the previous operation. On DRE, internal opening was felt at the 6 o'clock position at the level of the dentate line, which was communicated with the previously operated PNS wound, and the tract was felt up to that wound. The sphincter tone was normal with a normal temperature of the perineum and anal canal. Timeline of the case is depicted in  Timeline of the case. Pilonidal abscess, fistula in ano, PNS, and perianal abscess were taken into consideration for the differential diagnosis of this case. There was no sign of abscess, viz., tenderness, pus accumulation, and raised temperature of the body. While on examination, communication between fistula in ano and pilonidal sinus was found, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis region stated that there is communication between fistula in ano and PNS. So, perianal abscess and pilonidal abscess were excluded, and the case was diagnosed as a simultaneously coexisting PNS and fistula in ano. Urine routine/microscopic examination and Echocardiogram were within normal limits. Chest X-ray was normal. MRI of pelvis region showed communication between PNS and fistula in ano.",

      "findings_text": "\n Perianal disease encompasses a spectrum of debilitating conditions that affect the perianal region, including hemorrhoids, fistulas, abscesses, anal fissures, perianal manifestations of Crohn\u2019s disease, pilonidal sinuses, rectal prolapse, anal warts, perianal dermatitis, and rare conditions, such as perianal Paget\u2019s disease and anal stricture. Notably, perianal fistulas and abscesses are common complications of Crohn\u2019s disease. It is estimated that 1 in 5 individuals with Crohn\u2019s disease will develop some form of perianal disease within the first 10 years of diagnosis, with most cases eventually requiring surgical intervention[ The impact of these conditions extends beyond physical symptoms, involving not only pain and fecal incontinence, but also significant social stigma and a substantial reduction in health-related quality of life (HR-QoL)[ A key mediator in these pathways is the gut microbiota, a complex and dynamic community of micro-organisms that plays a vital role in maintaining immune balance. The gut microbiota influences emotional and psychological states[ In this letter, we aim to broaden the understanding of how illness perception and negative emotional states affect post-surgical recovery. We discuss the findings of Hou  The PNIE pathways demonstrate how the mind, brain, immune system, and hormones collectively regulate the body\u2019s responses to stress, inflammation, and healing. Within this network, the gut microbiota plays a crucial role in maintaining physiological balance. Increasing evidence highlights its influence beyond immune function, particularly in neuropsychiatric conditions, cognitive processes, behavior, and emotional regulation. Recent research has established strong links between the gut microbiota and conditions, such as anxiety, depression, and stress-related disorders[ The gut microbiota is crucial for regulating immune responses and promoting tissue repair, both of which are essential for postoperative recovery. An imbalance in gut bacteria (dysbiosis) has been linked to impaired immune function and increased systemic inflammation, which can delay wound healing[ For patients with perianal disease, who already face a heightened risk of post-surgical complications, maintaining a healthy gut microbiota is even more critical. Dysbiosis, exacerbated by surgical stress, antibiotics, and dietary changes, can impair the immune system\u2019s ability to control inflammation, prolonging recovery, and increasing the risk of infection. Although the link between the gut microbiota and anorectal diseases is still under-researched, emerging evidence underscores the microbiota\u2019s influence on immune modulation and tissue repair[ In addition to the gut microbiota, the wound microbiota[ Traditionally, recovery has been viewed through a purely biological lens, with psychological factors considered to impact health only indirectly, primarily through behavior.

      "findings_text": "Perianal fistulas are a morbid and common manifestation of Crohn\u2019s disease, From a medical treatment perspective, standard biologic prescribing uses streamlined fixed dosing regimens adopted from luminal Crohn\u2019s disease, which fail to meet patients\u2019 individual needs for intensified dosing schedules. Collectively, due to a lack of protocolized treatment strategies, there is variability in medical treatment and prescribing practices, variability in surgical treatment and therapeutic targets, and overall heterogeneity in standard care delivery; with care often only escalated following the emergence of complications such as perianal sepsis. There is a need to standardize practice to ensure the best outcomes are achieved. A new protocolized multidisciplinary treatment strategy, incorporating early proactive optimization of medical and surgical care, is hypothesized to improve healing rates of Crohn\u2019s perianal fistulas, by offering a more targeted and potentially sustainable approach to care. We developed a new treatment strategy and evaluated its efficacy in real-world experience. An investigator-initiated prospective real-world single-arm cohort study was used to evaluate the efficacy of a new treatment strategy optimizing medical and surgical care. A new protocolized, multidisciplinary care model for adults with Crohn\u2019s perianal fistulas was established at a single tertiary referral center with a preexisting inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) service. The service included specialist IBD and colorectal surgery clinics, weekly IBD multidisciplinary meetings (gastroenterologists, colorectal surgeons, radiologists, and IBD nurses), weekly therapeutic drug monitoring multidisciplinary meetings (gastroenterologists, IBD nurses, and pharmacists), and an IBD nurse dedicated to overseeing the implementation of the new treatment strategy. Ethics approval was obtained from  Adult patients with Crohn\u2019s perianal fistulas seen through the new care model, at the single tertiary referral center, were sequentially invited to participate, between March 1, 2021, and April 30, 2022. Patients were included irrespective of disease activity, disease duration, treatment experience, or duration of attendance through the baseline preexisting service. Patients with rectovaginal or rectovesical fistulas, complete proctectomies, or those pregnant or breastfeeding were excluded. The new treatment strategy implemented structured 3 monthly clinician reviews and a protocolized algorithm for managing patients with Crohn\u2019s perianal fistulas. The algorithm centralized around 3 stages of care, which were predetermined prior to study commencement after expert meetings involving specialist gastroenterologists, colorectal surgeons, and radiologists.

This was on a background of schizophrenia and dyslipidaemia. The rectal prolapse was divided at the level of the rectosigmoid junction above the peritoneal reflection. Significant intraoperative bleeding was encountered, likely owing to branches of the superior and middle rectal arteries. This was adequately controlled with diathermy. A hand-sewn anastomosis between the remaining rectum and sigmoid colon was formed with 3-0 polydioxanone sutures (PDS) in two layers. On day two following the procedure, his routine blood count demonstrated a haemoglobin of 68, prompting CT angiography of the mesenteric and pelvic arteries. Whilst there was no active haemorrhage, the scan demonstrated a large hyperdense lesion consistent with a postoperative haematoma in the rectovesical pouch extending to the presacral space (Figure\u00a0 (A)\u00a0axial,\u00a0(B)\u00a0sagittal, demonstrating a hyperdense lesion consistent with postoperative haematoma in the rectovesical pouch and extending to the presacral space. A slightly hyperdense haemoperitoneum in the pelvis is noted in\u00a0(B). The patient represented to the emergency department 10 days after discharge with fevers and lower abdominal pain. His blood biochemistry revealed an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) of 256 mg/L. CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated that the previously known large haematoma and haemoperitoneum had become replaced by an encapsulated fluid collection with a thickened, enhancing peripheral wall and adjacent inflammatory fat stranding (Figure\u00a0 (A)\u00a0axial,\u00a0(B)\u00a0sagittal, demonstrating an encapsulated infected collection evidenced by the thickened, enhancing peripheral wall and adjacent inflammatory fat stranding. Gas in the collection resembles an anastomotic leak (Axial). The next day, feculent content was noted in the drainage bag. A CT fistulogram with contrast injected through the drain confirmed the formation of a fistula between the colorectal anastomosis and perirectal abscess, with appearances resembling that of an anastomotic leak (Figure\u00a0 (A)\u00a0axial,\u00a0(B)\u00a0sagittal. Contrast injected via the drain is visible in the collection and colon, confirming a fistula tract between the anastomosis and collection. The fistula tract is demonstrated in\u00a0(B). We report on a rare and previously undocumented scenario where an infected postoperative haematoma formed a fistula through an adjacent colorectal anastomosis, mimicking an anastomotic leak. Whilst an occult primary anastomotic leak cannot be entirely excluded, the clinical and radiological evidence heavily suggests that fistulisation through the anastomosis occurred secondary to the perirectal abscess in this case.

In this study, we used a multi-omics approach including single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), mass cytometry (CyTOF), and spatial transcriptomics (ST) to unravel mucosal cell response in an extensive cohort of patients with PCD, CD without perianal disease (NPCD), or idiopathic perianal fistula or cryptoglandular fistulas (IPF). PCD fistulas showed hyperactivated pathogenic signals including interferon (IFN)G and TNF responses. Ileal and rectal cells from PCD patients also expressed increased IFN-\u03b3-responsive and EMT genes compared to NPCD patients. Furthermore, we identified expanded IFNG+ pathogenic Th17 cells in both fistula tracts and ileal mucosa from PCD patients. Altered frequencies and inflammatory phenotypes of immune cells in the fistula tracts, external fistula opening, and rectum in PCD patients were uncovered by CyTOF. Moreover, molecular modules associated with anti-TNF therapy were identified in PCD samples. Altogether, this study identified IFN-\u03b3 as a potential therapeutic target for PCD. We recruited three groups of patients with a history of: 1) PCD confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis and/or examination under anesthesia (EUA) by a colorectal surgeon (n = 24); 2) NPCD (n = 29); 3) IPF without a history of inflammatory bowel disease, diagnosed on EUA by a colorectal surgeon (n = 10;  Cells were washed with Cy-FACS buffer (CyPBS, Rockland, MB-008; 0.1% BSA, Sigma, A3059; 0.02% Sodium Azide, Sigma, 71289, 2mM EDTA, Hoefer, GR123-100) and stained with antibodies on ice for an hour.

Chronic anal fistulas that persist for >10\u00a0years are considered a potential risk factor for fistula-associated cancers [ A 43-year-old male patient was admitted in July 2022 due to an anal fistula. The patient had a 15-year history of recurrent perianal abscesses with prior surgical intervention in 2007, 2011, and 2012. However, following each surgery, the wounds failed to heal completely, resulting in persistent drainage of purulent fluid through the external orifices and intermittent recurrence of perianal abscesses. Two weeks before admission, the patient reported a significant increase in perianal pain. Notably, the patient had no history of inflammatory bowel disease, but had been diagnosed with HIV infection for 10\u00a0years. Physical examination revealed two external fistulous orifices located at the 3-o\u2019clock and 9-o\u2019clock positions, ~3\u00a0cm from the anal verge. Rectoscopy confirmed that the internal opening was situated within the anal crypt at the 6-o\u2019clock position, and laboratory tests conducted upon admission did not reveal any abnormalities. Colonoscopy was performed and no underlying intestinal pathology was identified. Perianal magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intersphincteric fistula ( Preoperative perianal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination. Postoperative pathology indicated squamous cell carcinoma. The relationship between cancer and anal fistulas can manifest in a number of ways [ In this case, the patient presented with a carcinoma at the site of an anal fistula. The patient had a history of chronic anal fistula for 15\u00a0years and a 10-year history of HIV infection. Preoperative colonoscopy ruled out the possibility of cancerous cells spreading from the anal canal and rectum to perianal tissue and gastrointestinal tract metastasis. Additionally, the examination eliminated the possibility that the cancer predated the fistula or that the anal fistula developed concurrently with anal canal carcinoma. Therefore, it is considered that the carcinoma arose secondary to chronic anal fistula. The precise pathogenic mechanism underlying squamous cell carcinoma associated with anal fistulas is a vital factor in cancer development [ The diagnosis of cancers associated with fistulas is challenging. Biopsy of the fistula tract is essential for diagnosis and early intervention [ This article presents the case of a patient with chronic anal fistula that ultimately progressed to fistula-associated squamous cell carcinoma, which suggests a potential link between HIV infection and the development of fistula-related cancer. The precise etiology and mechanisms underlying malignant transformation of anal fistulas remain unclear. Prognosis is dependent on early diagnosis and treatment, which emphasizes the importance of biopsy in the management of chronic anal fistulas. ",

The patient was admitted for suspected appendicitis at the local medical facility. Following this, an enhanced CT (computed tomography) scan of the abdomen revealed thickening and irregular enhancement of the wall of the proximal ileum, cecum, and adjacent ascending colon, accompanied by a surrounding mass shadow, suggesting a high likelihood of CD. The colonoscopy revealed the presence of a mass located at the terminal portion of the cecum. Subsequent biopsy of the cecum demonstrated chronic enteritis with ulcer and a small noncaseating granuloma within the muscularis mucosa. No special staining was done on the biopsy specimen. The administration of anti-infection and analgesic therapy did not yield improvement. Right hemicolectomy was undertaken due to the ineffectiveness of symptomatic treatment and the potential risk of intestinal wall perforation.

In 2021, a total of 1,933,381 incident cases in India accounted for 28% of global TB burden.[ A 47-year-old male patient sought medical attention at the outpatient department, reporting persistent pain in the perianal region for the past 6 months. The patient denied experiencing fever, cough, shortness of breath, or loss of appetite. There was no history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The patient had not been previously treated with anti-TB therapy (ATT) and denied contact with TB patients. Upon local examination, there was a nontender induration of 4 \u00d7 3 cm in the right gluteal region at 7 o\u203aclock position approximately 4 cm from anal verge and 2 \u00d7 2 cm in the left perianal region approximately 2 cm from anal verge without any ulceration or sinuses. The margin of the induration is diffuse with a smooth surface and without any ulceration or discharge. Initially, conservative management with antibiotics (ofloxacin and ornidazole (200/500 mg)) twice daily for 7 days was adviced and a sitz bath was started. However, the response was incomplete, and the patient returned with multiple abscesses over the perianal region. Incision and drainage were done. Although his condition improved after drainage, he again presented with pain and discharge drainage sites. The pus culture showed no growth, and the AFB and CBNNAT tests were negative. The patient was restarted on antibiotics (Tab ofloxacin ornidazole 200/500 mg) due to a partial response to the previous course. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was scheduled to determine the extent of the fistula and abscess. MRI of the pelvic region revealed enhancing irregular thickening of rectum for a length of 4 cm along with extensive soft tissue thickening around the perirectal region, perianal region, and medial aspect of the bilateral gluteal region. Tran sphincter fistula with internal opening at 5 o\u2019clock position was also noted [ MRI of pelvic region showing extensive soft tissue thickening around perirectal and perianal regions Histopathology image (H and E staining) showing caseating granulomatous lesion consisting of multinucleated giant cells of Langerhans type Photography showing healed lesion after 2 months of treatment The occurrence of perianal TB is extremely rare, accounting for 1% of the GI tract, while GI TB makes up less than 1% of all TB cases.[ Perianal TB is mostly associated with direct evidence of TB foci in lungs or intestine. Sayaka Tago has reported a case of perianal TB that has concurrent pulmonary TB.[ The most common clinical feature of anal TB is anal fistula. Our cases presented as perineal abscess.

Coccydynia is mainly idiopathic and develops from unknown causes. However, direct injuries to the sacrococcygeal region such as falling from a height and challenging vaginal delivery are known to be the cause in several cases [ Chronic refractory coccydynia, defined as persistent pain for more than three months, may mandate surgical management in the form of coccygectomy [ The standard technique for coccygectomy typically involves making a vertical midline incision near the coccyx, exposing the bone, and then carefully removing part or all of the coccyx and its ligamentous attachments. However, the technique may vary slightly depending on the surgeon's preference and the patient's condition. In a retrospective study [ A 41-year-old male presented in 2016 with chronic coccydynia for 10 years. This coccygeal pain radiated to his gluteal area and was typically aggravated by prolonged sitting. The pain varied in severity over time until it became so intense that it reached a pain score of 9/10, causing him an inability to sit. The patient did not have any medical illnesses, with a history of previous gastric sleeve and anal fistula repair. Different imaging and screening modalities were used to assess the patient\u2019s condition, including sacrococcygeal X-ray, pelvis CT scan, and lumbar MRI (Figures  Operative details Before the procedure, the patient was commenced on a soft diet for 48 hours. He received two doses of Fleet Enema. The first dose was administered in the evening time one day before the surgery. The second was given early morning on the same day of the surgery. Cefazolin 2 g and metronidazole 100 mg were used as prophylactic antibiotics before skin incision. The patient was positioned prone on a standard Jackson table. Gentle traction of the skin and the gluteal area was done using plaster to further expose the midline crease. Under a C-arm, a vertical skin mark was made over the coccygeal area. The perianal area was covered with iodine-soaked gauze distal to our intended incision. Prepping and draping were done in the usual sterile fashion. A vertical incision was made over the coccygeal area. Dissection of the soft tissue was carried down to the bone using a monopolar. Subperiosteal dissection was carefully continued from the midline posteriorly down to the lateral side bilaterally. Using a blade, the sacrococcygeal disk was removed. Then using towel clips to direct the coccyx, dissection was carried from the posterolateral side into the ventral side while maintaining subperiosteal dissection. Hemostasis was controlled using monopolar and coagulation. Then the coccygectomy was completed, and no rectal injury was encountered. Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs were taken to confirm the complete removal of the bone. The distal edge of the sacral bone was rasped, and bone wax was applied. Thorough irrigation and loc",

Congenital tumors are the most common tumors of the presacral space, accounting for 55% to 70% of all lesions [ Tailgut cysts develop in the final section of the intestine from which the rectum and anus extend. The embryo develops a tail on approximately the fifth week of gestation that regresses during the eighth week of fetal life. The ectoderm then invaginates to the end of the gut and the anus forms. However, if this process is disturbed, a stray fragment of hindgut remains, and the tailgut cyst is formed [ Tailgut cysts are more common in females, with a 5:1 ratio of predominance [ Because of these lesions\u2019 rarity and their potential risk of malignancy, we present two cases, which occurred in our clinic, to increase awareness of this type of lesion. First patient: The first patient is a 40-year-old woman with large intestinal hyperplastic polyps and hemorrhoids. The pelvis minor tumor was diagnosed in 2016 during a routine ultrasound, and the patient underwent an unsuccessful surgery the same year. The tumor was asymptomatic, but in 2021, the patient started to experience morning tenesmus, urinary outflow disorders and painful ovulation. The physical examination showed left-sided thickness in a per vaginam examination. An MRI scan the with contrast of the lesser pelvis revealed a cystic, multilocular mass measuring 8.9 cm \u00d7 8.1 cm\u00d7 6.3 cm. This lesion shifted the rectum forward and to the left. It pressured the reproductive organ. The MRI scan aroused suspicion of a tailgut cyst [ Due to the symptomatic character of the tumor, a laparotomy was performed. The peritoneum was opened with a midline incision. Aside from an inflamed left uterine appendage, no pathological changes were found. Then, the peritoneum was opened on the right side, from the rectum. A large cystic tumor was visible, filling presacral and precoccygeal areas. The tumor was dissected from the mesorectum of the sidewall of the pelvis, from the reproductive organ from below and from the coccyx bone going down to the pelvic floor where infiltration of the coccyx was visible. The patient was shifted onto their stomach and another midline incision was performed, which made the removal of the tumor and coccyx bone possible.

The patient inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) preoperative pathological examination confirming rectal adenocarcinoma; (2) underwent laparoscopic surgery, including anterior resection (AR), low anterior resection (LAR), or ISR surgery; and (3) confirmed AL during hospitalization or recovery period. The exclusion criteria were: (1) emergency surgery for acute intestinal obstruction, bleeding, or perforation; (2) subtotal colectomy or total colectomy due to multiple primary tumors; and (3) individuals with distant organ metastasis. All patients provided written informed consent, and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (ethical approval number 22/503\u20133705). \nFor patients with preoperative stage cT3/N\u2009+\u2009advanced low rectal cancer, nCRT is recommended as a routine treatment.

Once AL is suspected, computed tomography (CT) or endoscopy is performed for further diagnosis. Protective measures such as active anti-infection, maintaining unobstructed drainage, and systemic nutritional support therapy can be considered for patients with ileostomy. For patients without ileostomy, secondary surgery is performed on the transverse colon or ileum stoma if there is apparent peritonitis or shock. The healing of the anastomosis in all patients with AL is evaluated every month in our outpatient clinic, with the first choice being an internal anal examination.

Thus, the present study aimed at providing the CSA of the pudendal nerve at various site of entrapment and trajectory distances from possible anatomical landmarks that can be used to locate the pudendal nerve surgically. The present study was a descriptive study done in the Department of Anatomy, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Kalyani, over a period of 2 months. Around 10 cadaveric specimens with equal sex distribution (5 male and 5 female) were taken for dissection. The cadaveric specimens without any gross abnormality were included and the specimens with distorted pelvis anatomy, broken pelvis were excluded from the study. The study was started after the approval of Institute Ethics Committee (IEC) AIIMS, Kalyani (IEC/AIIMS/Kalyani/certificate/2024/436). The pelvic organs were removed, and the sacral plexus was identified after removing the pelvic fascia. The plexus was traced from the level of roots to the branches and the variations in the formation of the pudendal nerve were noted. The pudendal nerve was identified at the gluteal region below the piriformis muscle and was traced further into the ischioanal fossa. The branches of the nerve were dissected in the ischioanal fossa and the morphometric measurements were taken. Further the dissection was carried out over the external genital organ to find the dorsal nerve of penis/clitoris and the measurements were taken.

The intricate anatomy of the gluteal and pelvic areas, including the proximity to the rectum, bladder, pelvic vasculature, sciatic nerve, and pelvic bones, makes assessment and management challenging [ In pediatric patients, penetrating injuries are primarily caused by falls onto sharp objects, unintentional impalement, or, less frequently, abuse. Impalement by common stationary items, such as pencils, is uncommon, but these objects can cause deep, trajectory wounds that may involve vital structures. Complicating the situation is the often-misleading external appearance; small entry wounds can mask the extensive internal injury [ Radiological imaging, especially computed tomography (CT), plays a vital role in tracing the trajectory and potential visceral involvement. However, CT can sometimes misjudge the severity or depth of penetration, especially when it comes to differentiating the mucosal indentation from true transmural perforation [ In this case report, we present a rare case of an 11-year-old boy who suffered a gluteal impalement injury from a pencil. CT findings demonstrated penetration into the rectosigmoid colon, but the diagnostic laparoscopy and colonoscopy revealed no perforation. The patient was managed conservatively without the need for colostomy or laparotomy. This case highlights the importance of correlating imaging with intraoperative and endoscopic findings, supporting a conservative approach in selected pediatric patients. An 11-year-old previously healthy\u00a0boy arrived at the emergency department after a penetrating injury to the left buttock at his school. According to the patient and school staff, a classmate had placed a pencil upright on a chair as a prank, and the patient unknowingly sat on it, resulting in a penetrating wound to the left buttock. Upon arrival at the emergency department, the patient was alert and hemodynamically stable. Vital signs showed a blood pressure of 115/78 mmHg, a pulse of 82 bpm, a temperature of 37\u00b0C, a respiratory rate of 24 breaths/minute, and an SpO\u2082 of 98%, all within normal limits. Physical examination revealed a puncture wound in the inferomedial aspect of the left gluteal region with no active bleeding or neurological or vascular compromise. The abdominal exam showed a soft, non-distended abdomen with normal bowel sounds. The digital rectal exam was delayed due to concerns for rectal involvement. Laboratory tests at presentation showed a normal hemoglobin level of 12.7 g/dL (reference: 11.5-15.5 g/dL), a white blood cell count of 9.8\u00d710\u2079/L (reference: 5.0-13.0 \u00d710\u2079/L), and a creatinine level of 0.47 mg/dL (reference: 0.52-0.69 mg/dL) (Table  WBC: white blood cell; CRP: C-reactive protein; NR: not reported CT pelvis with contrast revealed an elongated hyperdense foreign object measuring 12.4 cm \u00d7 6.7 mm traversing the ischiorectal and ischioanal fossae, wi",

      "findings_text": "Diverticular disease is one of the most prevalent gastrointestinal conditions encountered in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Acute diverticulitis arises from microscopic or macroscopic perforation of the diverticulum, typically due to localized inflammation and focal necrosis [ Clinical presentations range from mild, uncomplicated cases to severe, complicated forms associated with stricture formation, abscesses, bowel obstruction, perforation, and fistula development. Perforated diverticulitis, in particular, is a potentially life-threatening complication that may result in peritonitis, intra-abdominal abscesses, or systemic sepsis due to the translocation of fecal material and bacteria into the peritoneal cavity. In rare instances, the inflammatory and infectious process may extend beyond the peritoneum and involve retroperitoneal structures, leading to atypical extra-abdominal complications. We describe a rare presentation of perforated diverticulitis with retroperitoneal extension resulting in a complex abscess that tracked along the iliopsoas compartment into the left thigh, ultimately causing necrotizing myositis. While thigh abscesses are most commonly attributed to localized soft tissue infections, trauma, or foreign body reactions, this case highlights the importance of considering intra-abdominal sources in the differential diagnosis of unexplained lower extremity infections. This case report was presented as a Quickshot presentation at the Southeastern Surgical Congress 2023. A 77-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a three-day history of progressive left leg pain and swelling, resulting in difficulty bearing weight on the affected limb. The pain was localized primarily to the proximal medial thigh. She also reported a six-day history of sharp lower quadrant abdominal pain, which worsened with movement and radiated across the lower abdomen. Associated symptoms included one episode of non-bloody diarrhea and subjective fever.\u00a0 Her medical history was notable for previously treated diverticulitis, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and dyslipidemia. She had undergone a colonoscopy five years prior but was unable to recall the findings. She denied the use of corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, or hormonal therapy and had no history of vasculitis or deep vein thrombosis (DVT). On presentation, her vital signs were: temperature 36.3 \u00b0C, blood pressure 110/59 mmHg, heart rate 89 bpm, and oxygen saturation 100% on room air. Physical examination revealed a doughy, mildly distended abdomen (Figure  A bilateral lower extremity duplex ultrasound was negative for DVT. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis revealed gas within the posterior paracolic gutter and left iliac fossa, extending into the soft tissues of the left thigh with evidence of intramuscular gas.

Upon evaluation, ultrasound examination showed a large abscess measuring 8\u00d74 cm in the right ischiorectal fossa, prompting drainage through an endorectal incision and intravenous antibiotics administration (1 gram amoxicillin+clavulanic acid). Although the fever resolved and bacterial wound and blood cultures (aerobic and anaerobic) returned negative results, persistence of exudate from the lesion prompted further investigation. A subsequent MRI and colonoscopy exposed a narrow fistula extending from a large abscess in the ischiorectal fossa to the mid-third of the anal canal, leading to suspicion of ACD ( A 16-year-old girl (weight 50 kg) was referred to our center following the incidental finding of a large ischiorectal cyst discovered during a routine gynecological evaluation.

Various techniques, including trans-anal, trans-coccygeal, abdominal, and posterior sagittal approaches, have been described [ In the second case, due to the cyst being located exclusively within the ischiorectal fossa, after a multidisciplinary discussion, a robotic approach was preferred. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first case of ACD treated with a robot. The use of robotic assistance played a crucial role in facilitating a minimally invasive procedure, particularly within the confined space of the pelvis. The inherent magnification of the robotic camera and the dexterity of robotic arms played a crucial role in the precise mass excision within the confined areas [ Anal canal duplication should be considered in the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with lesions in the ischiorectal fossa.

      "findings_text": "Anal fistula is a common disease usually manifested as local pain and discharge, which is defined as the abnormal connection between the perineal skin and the anal canal [ Recurrence of anal fistula usually occurs due to incomplete obliteration of the fistula track and its associated elements during operation [ However, compared with almost all studies focused on preoperative MRI, the application of postoperative MRI is very rare, which can evaluate surgical effectiveness like missed track or internal opening, and postoperative complications like abscess formation or recurrence track. In the early postoperative stage, MRI evaluation has been faced with challenges because of complex MRI signals, difficulties in distinguishing healing (granulation) tissue from active fistula, the presence of untreated tracks and extensions without clinical symptoms [ Therefore, the purpose of this study was to differentiate postoperative healing tissue and active fistula by analyzing DCE-MRI semi-quantitative parameters for assessing surgical effectiveness and monitoring postoperative complications, especially in patients with complex fistula or existing clinical symptoms after surgery. A total of 36 consecutive patients admitted during the period of September 2018 to December 2019 were enrolled in this study, encompassing 31 men and five women aged 22 to 71 (median 39.5\u2009\u00b1\u200925.75). Thereinto, 13 patients underwent preoperative DCE-MRI but not postoperative MRI, 14 patients underwent postoperative DCE-MRI and preoperative conventional MRI (non-DCE-MRI), and 9 patients underwent both preoperative and postoperative DCE-MRI. All patients in this study were suffering from idiopathic cryptoglandular anal fistulas, while other secondary anal fistulas were excluded, such as Crohn\u2019s disease, tuberculosis and malignancies. MRI examinations were performed on a 3.0 T MR scanner (Vantage Titan, Canon Medical Systems Corporation, Japan), using a 16-channel surface coil. Patients were imaged in a head-first supine position with the center of the magnetic field on the pubic symphysis. Prior to the MRI examination, no specific bowel preparation was administrated, and no antispasmodic agent was required as a premedication. Oblique axial and coronal images were obtained by orientation perpendicular and parallel to the anal canal. For all patients, all MRI scans are performed with the same protocol (Table\u00a0 \n MRI protocol DCE-MRI was performed using a dynamic three-dimensional T1-weighted fast field echo imaging (3D-T1-FFE) with the following sequence parameters: TR\u2009=\u20093.7 ms, TE\u2009=\u20091.3 ms, flip angle\u2009=\u200912 degrees, bandwidth\u2009=\u2009488.2\u00a0Hz/pixel, slice thickness\u2009=\u20094\u00a0mm, intersection gap\u2009=\u20090\u00a0mm, number of slices\u2009=\u200926, acquisition matrix\u2009=\u2009192\u2009\u00d7\u2009192, FOV\u2009=\u2009250\u00a0mm \u00d7 200\u00a0mm.

There have been many different applications of 3D models. Orthopedic surgery has created preoperative models to aid in sizing joint replacements. In this case report, we describe our experience implementing 3D printing technology in planning and informed consent with a patient with a very low rectal tumor. We hypothesized that having a 3D model of the tumor and the surrounding structures would help anticipate potential issues in the operating room and the extent of the operation and improve the patient\u2019s understanding of his disease process, all of which have been documented in the literature. The Institutional Review Board at our facility deemed it unnecessary to get informed consent to publish this case report. However, the informed consent process at the VA includes using deidentified information for publication, in which the patient signed and agreed. A 54-year-old male presented to the colorectal surgery clinic with the chief complaint of a painful anal swelling that had been ongoing for several weeks. He denied any obvious drainage but would occasionally notice some moisture. He had had regular bowel movements with occasional pain but no blood. His vitals in the clinic were a heart rate of 106 beats per minute, blood pressure of 145/87, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and a temperature of 98.2\u00b0F. On the physical exam, a large, firm, tender posterior anal mass was noted; on a digital exam, a small amount of what was thought to be pus was noted on the examiner\u2019s finger. A complete blood count from approximately 6 weeks earlier was significant for 11.4 \u00d7 10 Upon arrival to the operating room, the patient was placed under general anesthesia and in a prone jackknife position. The operative surgeon conducted a digital rectal exam; he could not feel a superior margin to the posterior perirectal mass. A rigid proctoscope was then inserted, and a posterior mass indenting the posterior rectal wall was noted and extended superiorly 11 cm from the anal verge. Once past the mass, the rest of the rectum and sigmoid appeared normal. Proctoscopy revealed no mucosal irregularities, and no pus was noted. Next, a fine needle aspiration using an 18-gauge needle with a syringe was inserted via the posterior midline perianal skin located one-inch posterior to the anal verge and directed superiorly into the retrorectal mass. Aspiration produced a red, gelatinous material. The aspirate was sent for cytology, biopsy, and culture, and the procedure was terminated. The pathology results were significant for strong diffuse expression of vimentin, CD68, and CD34 and weak patchy CD10. There was a strong CD117 and DOG1 expression concerning gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). A c-kit exon 11 mutation was noted with a p.K550-K558 deletion. The Ki67 exceeded 10%.

This extraperitoneal abscess causes insidious, occult, and prolonged illness. Diagnostic delay and inadequate drainage are common, resulting in prolonged sepsis and associated high morbidity and mortality [ Approval for the study was obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC) bearing reference number 65/2023 at St. John's Medical College Hospital, following which informed consent was obtained from patients involved in the study. Owing to the retrospective design, the data analysis began with the review of the data that had been digitally recorded from May 2022 and continued through June 2023. Furthermore, the electronically stored clinical data containing the patients' demographics, medical history, comorbidities, clinical symptoms, and history of prior surgical interventions were assessed. The procedure of the data extraction was supervised by a number of reviewers to guarantee accuracy. Additionally, cadaveric specimens were employed for the purposes of anatomical correlation and performing procedural practice. These specimens were acquired from the College's repository. While utilizing these specimens, the Department of Anatomy had oversight for the acquisition and preservation of the specimens, and they also ensured that established procedures were followed. When dissections were performed, it was ensured that as much of the specimen was preserved as possible. The research team reviewed the medical records of all patients diagnosed with ischiorectal/ perianal abscesses. This includes six patients who were all males between the ages of 35 and 50, and their details are presented in the subsequent section. The patients diagnosed with extraperitoneal abscesses on CT imaging and clinically diagnosed with ischiorectal or perianal abscesses were subsequently included in the cohort. The extraperitoneal abscess is defined in our study by evidence of collection or air foci in the pelvic extraperitoneal spaces such as the prevesicle, the para rectal, and the pre-sacral spaces, and there may be extensions of the collection into the anterior extraperitoneal space or the retroperitoneum. Among the six patients who presented with extraperitoneal sepsis, for our understanding concerning the symptomatology and CT images, we would like to categorize them into A, B, and C. List A comprises three patients who had perianal pain as their presenting complaint and had undergone incision and drainage but remained symptomatic with persisting discharge in whom the CT images showed collection in prevesical and pararectal spaces ascending into pre peritoneum and retroperitoneum.

Among these, spreading across specific anatomical spaces is an infrequent but potentially serious complication, even carrying the risk of mortality. Abscess formation in the space of Retzius is notably uncommon and has primarily been documented in scant case reports [ Thus, the complex anatomical planes within the extraperitoneal space provide a conduit for disease dissemination from distant etiologies, posing diagnostic challenges that may hinder the timely implementation of definitive treatments. Also, misdiagnosis or insufficient treatment may result in early recurrence, necessitating a second intervention. In addition, therapeutic strategies vary, influenced by factors such as existing comorbidities or medical histories, which can impact the progress of recovery. Notably, there is a scarcity of previous cases addressing the extraperitoneal spread of perirectal abscess, and a lack of consensus has been established in this regard. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of anatomy and a heightened awareness of potential management pitfalls are essential when navigating such clinical scenarios. Emphasizing the sharing of experiences through case studies becomes crucial in advancing knowledge and improving patient outcomes. This report presents a case analysis of an effectively managed Retzius space infection originating from a complex perirectal abscess. In addition, we provide a comprehensive review of the intricacies surrounding the anatomy, pathophysiology, and optimal treatment strategies associated with perirectal abscesses extending into the extraperitoneum.

The incidence of horseshoe abscess after THD is not well established, and its risk factors are unclear. Furthermore, the optimal management of horseshoe abscess after THD is not well defined, and there is no consensus on the best surgical or medical approach. In this report, we describe a case of a patient who came to our hospital six days after THD surgery with a complaint of anorectal pain, and whose CT scan showed a horseshoe abscess. This article will be presented as a poster at the 2024 SAGES (Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons) Annual Meeting,\u00a0Cleveland, OH, on April 17-20, 2024. A 72-year-old male, with a medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and who was a current\u00a0smoker, was referred for anal bleeding, which was associated with constipation over the past 10 years. His physical examination showed a stage IV rectal prolapse with internal hemorrhoid. The rectal examination under anesthesia with the repair of the rectal prolapse with transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization\u00a0was performed electively. With the patient under general anesthesia and lying in the lithotomy position, a folded 4x4 gauze was placed into the rectum and withdrawn slowly to simulate the passage of stool. The rectal mucosa did prolapse and did not automatically return to the rectum, so it was classified as a grade IV rectal prolapse. Dilated internal hemorrhoids did accompany this prolapse. Examination of the anus and perineum first revealed no ano-dermal skin lesions. A digital examination was then done, and the anal tone was found to be normal. There were no visible or palpable mucosal irregularities of the anoderm or the anal canal. The anal sphincter was uniform in its thickness without palpable masses or nodules. There was no anal fissure or scarring. There were engorged hemorrhoidal cushions from the 1 o\u2019clock to the 5 o\u2019clock positions. We used the Doppler ultrasound probe to identify the six terminal branches of the superior rectal artery (located at 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 o\u2019clock).

Patients who undergo laparoscopic PE have large tumors often due to invasion of the surrounding organs, and precise handling of the forceps at the pelvic floor is difficult. Consequently, during laparoscopic PE, unnecessary dead space tends to develop around the pelvic floor ( The GelPOINT V-path is a novel surgical instrument developed as a platform for Transvaginal Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (vNOTES), which enables endoscopic procedures in a narrow vagina ( A 55-year-old patient with stage IIIB cervical mucinous carcinoma (gastric type) underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy; however, one year later, the tumor recurred as a solitary lesion in the pelvis. The recurrent tumor occupied the left uterosacral ligament and perforated the rectum ( A laparoscopic procedure with four trocar placements was initiated ( The uterus, rectum, bladder, and ureters were in one mass and fixed to the left pelvic sidewall. The pararectal and paravesical spaces were developed, and the cardinal ligaments were observed. After dividing the right ureter, the right cardinal ligament was divided at the internal iliac vessels ( Next, we dissected down to the pelvic floor. Because the resected pelvic organs, including the recurrent tumor, were large and overhanging on the left side, the movement of the laparoscopic forceps on the left pelvic floor was restricted ( Surgical view of the left pelvic floor (LEER side). The surgical field on the left pelvic floor was poor owing to the overhanging tumor, and the forceps interfered with the tumor.

Currently, surgery remains the main treatment method for common rectal cancer, with abdominoperineal resection (APR)[ However, despite the major progress in the multidisciplinary treatment approach to rectal cancer, about 40% of rectal cancer patients will undergo an abdominoperineal resection, resulting in a permanent colostomy.[ Here, we propose a new method of combined abdominal and perineal resection, as an alternative to the conventional APR, that is, individualised resection of the levator ani muscle guided by laparoscopy to reduce the positive rate of CMR and ITP, reduce local recurrence (LR) and simplify the operation of the perineum. In addition, we provide evidence that laparoscopic-dominant abdominoperineal resection (LDAPR) is a safe technology for rectal cancer. The primary endpoints were CRM (+), ITP, 2-year overall survival (2-year OS) and 2-year LR. The secondary endpoints were the post-operative complications. This study retrospectively used medical records of rectal cancer surgery cases from September 2014 to December 2019. The experimental group included patients who had undergone laparoscopic-led individualised levator ani resection from January 2017 to December 2019, while the control group included patients who had received laparoscopic conventional APR surgery from September 2014 to December 2016. The ethics committee of Zhangzhou Municipal Hospital Affiliated of Fujian Medical University approved this retrospective investigation and waived the regulations of informed consent due to the design of the study. Solitary rectal adenocarcinoma or carcinoma diagnosed by colonoscopy and biopsy, and the anus could not be preserved; the high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) staging below T3a, and some T3b and T3c patients were reduced after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy; age <75 years old; no local infection such as anal fistula and perianal abscess; no severe cardiopulmonary, liver and kidney dysfunction; laparoscopic surgery and no sexual dysfunction and urination prior to surgery. Post-operative pathological findings of non-adenocarcinoma such as signet-ring cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma; medical records of T4 stage; patients with distant metastasis or local inability to undergo R0 resection, but palliative resection is performed; transition to laparotomy. The operation is divided into two phases: the abdominal and perineal phases. The abdominal phase is done according to the conventional surgical procedures that target the total mesorectal excision (TME) plane. It follows the principle of low anterior resection in laparoscopic anterior rectotomy that ensures the separation of the left Toldt space. The lymph nodes at the inferior mesenteric artery and the root of the vein are dissected at a high position and ligated. The mesorectum is later freed to the sacral promontory, separated along with the retrorectal space to the level ",

      "findings_text": "Malignant disease of the colon and rectum is one of the most frequent cancers in Western countries, and despite the advances of oncological therapies, the surgical approach remains a milestone for its treatment [ These cases require a more demolitive surgery, such as abdominoperineal resection (APR or Miles\u2019 procedure), consisting in a permanent colostomy after the removal of the sigmoid colon, rectum and anus. Despite using the laparoscopic or robotic approach, the large perineal defect can make the reconstructive phase of this procedure extremely challenging, especially when an extralevator abdominoperineal excision (ELAPE) is needed; the process involves dissecting outside the extralevator muscles plane and removing the entire pelvic floor to achieve oncological radicality [ The main surgical techniques for perineal reconstruction after APR, in addition to the direct closure of the perineal wound where it is technically possible, include fascial-myocutaneous flaps, omentoplasty, tissue expanders, silicone breast implants and synthetic or biological prostheses [ Materials used in synthetic prostheses, such as polypropylene, create visceral adhesions in contact with the peritoneum and the pelvic floor organs that can cause erosions, fistulas, or perforations; for this reason, these meshes are not recommended in perineal wound reconstruction. On the other hand, biological prostheses, despite being more advantageous, have limitations related to low resistance and reduced integration into the tissue (ingrowth), the tendency of shrinking, high costs, the risk of rejection reactions or transmission of viral infections and the need of tissue tracking and preoperative soaking [ The use of biosynthetic prosthetic materials in recent years has revolutionized the pelvic\u2013perineal reconstructive surgery, achieving satisfactory results. These prostheses have a chemical structure very similar to the natural polymers contained in biological tissues, such as collagen, which gives these materials excellent biocompatibility. The interaction between the three-dimensional matrix of the synthetic copolymers and human tissue promotes cell adhesion and cell growth. In some circumstances, the body \u201cmetabolizes\u201d the polymer by degrading it over time until it is completely reabsorbed after tissue regeneration. This is the case of the GORE The aim of the current observational retrospective study is to analyse and compare the surgical and oncological outcomes in patients undergoing Miles\u2019 APR and perineal wound reconstruction with or without the use of an absorbable biosynthetic prosthesis in two high-volume tertiary centres.

Data were obtained from medical records. The diagnosis was based on clinical findings (necrosis of the skin and/or fascia, gray discolored fascia, \u201cdishwater fluid,\u201d lack of bleeding, and tissue resistance of the fascial layer). The extent of infection that limited itself to the genital, perineal, or perianal regions was considered as \u201clocalized;\u201d otherwise it was considered as \u201cdiffused\u201d. Patients were divided into two groups based on wound management: group A comprised patients treated with NPWT and group B comprised patients treated with conventional dressing. This study was approved by the Institutional Human Investigations Committee. Broad-spectrum anti-infection treatment comprising carbapenem and vancomycin was empirically administered upon diagnosis of FG and subsequently modified based on the culture results. The duration of anti-infection treatment required comprehensive consideration of systemic signs and symptoms, local signs of infection, and laboratory test results. Emergency surgical debridement was performed within 24\u2005h after admission. An incision was made in the area of sclerosis, erythema, ulceration, or necrosis. The necrotic tissue was removed, drainage was ensured, and thorough dissection along the fascial plane was performed to explore the extent of the infection until viable tissue was identified. Samples for culture were routinely obtained. Digital rectal examination was routinely performed to confirm the presence of anal fistula. Colostomy was performed for patients with anal fistulas or severe perianal involvement. Suprapubic cystostomy was performed for patients with urethral fistulas.

However, different aspects of the pelvic floor may become affected through tissue rupture, compression, stretching, with associated nerve, muscle and connective tissue damage. Perineal trauma affects millions of women with an incidence of over 91% in nulliparous women and over 70% in multiparous women [ No single document encompasses all elements required for classification, diagnosis and treatment of obstetric pelvic floor disorders. Such a report requires a full outline of the terminology for the different types of obstetric trauma, symptoms, signs, clinical assessments, imaging and functional investigations, the most common diagnoses, prediction, prevention, and management. The aim of this Working Group was to develop a Terminology Report as a definitional document, collating the definitions of those terms, related to obstetric pelvic floor disorders. This document will include definitions of perineal and pelvic floor trauma and associated disorders. Definitions of pelvic floor disorders that occur during pregnancy and up to 12\u00a0months postpartum will be considered for inclusion, for the purpose of this document. The rationale for this choice was based on evidence around the effect of pregnancy, childbirth and postnatal factors on the pelvic floor and the natural history of pelvic floor function recovery postnatally as well as possible influences of breastfeeding. As obstetric pelvic floor disorders encompass a wide range of anatomical and functional changes, it could potentially give rise to all definitional terms involving the entire pelvic floor. Important definitions already defined in existing terminology documents are acknowledged and presented where relevant. Explanatory notes on definitions have been expanded, where applicable as footnotes. Emphasis has been on the inclusion of terms in the relevant peer-reviewed literature. The aim is to assist clinical practice as well as research by developing a repository of appropriately selected and defined terms that will advise communication among professionals at different levels in the area of pelvic floor clinical practice as well as obstetric practice and research.

      "findings_text": "Anal and perianal abscesses are infective/inflammatory collections filled with pus, inflammatory cells and/or granulation tissue. They are often seen in the setting of complicated perianal fistula but can also be seen as the precipitating cause of perianal fistula. Perianal abscess is a part of a wide group of anorectal abscesses, and is the most common type of it. They are mainly confined to the perianal region but if left untreated, can extend to involve the continuations of the perianal space.\u00a0In the worst and most troublesome cases, these can also lead to systemic infections [ Common causes of perianal abscess include trauma, anal sex, diabetes mellitus, corticosteroid medications, immunosuppressive state, anal fissures and inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn's disease [ Patients commonly present with redness and swelling in the anal region often associated with throbbing pain, fever, tenderness, constipation and perianal discharge (in cases of fistulous tract formation). Males are more commonly affected as compared to females [ Early diagnosis of the condition is essential for timely intervention. Usually, clinical examination is sufficient to diagnose the presence of abscess as the cause of the patient\u2019s symptoms. However, to accurately evaluate the location, extent and possible associated complications, further radiological investigation is often needed. Various imaging modalities have been tried for decades including CT pelvis and CT/Xray-fistulography, but did not prove to be of much use. Anorectal ultrasound is a useful modality for identification and characterization of perianal abscess; however, its use is often limited owing to extreme pain and tenderness suffered by the patient due to underlying abscess. Transcutaneous perineal ultrasonography using high-frequency linear transducer can be used to identify the location of abscess, measure its approximate volume and grossly assess its loco-regional extent, however, detailed analysis can still not be done [ Contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) is currently the gold standard for perianal disease with almost 100% accuracy when compared with post-surgical outcomes. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is another technique that has high detection rate for abscesses in any part of the body [ Our study is an observational study of comparative cross-sectional design, conducted at All India Institute of Medical Sciences Bhopal, a tertiary care hospital, after approval from the Institutional Human Ethics Committee (IHEC) (approval number: IHECPGRMD035). Patients above 18 years of age with grade 2 and 4 perianal fistula and suspicion of perianal abscess were included in our study after obtaining written informed consent. Patients who had a history of fistula surgery, history of claustrophobia, non-consenting patients, contraindications for MRI such as metallic implants or contraindications to contrast agents and non-interpretable images were excluded from the study.

      "findings_text": "Cryptoglandular perianal fistulas are considered a later, chronic stage of perianal abscesses. The glandular crypts at the level of the dentate line are the typical origin of fistulas, which are induced by purulent and inflammatory processes [ The role of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) in colonic inflammation has been reported, and its abnormal accumulation is often associated with a more severe disease phenotype as well as a poor prognosis in perianal patients [ Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the abnormal integrity of the extracellular matrix (ECM) have been described in several human physiological and pathological processes, and their potential role has been suggested in the development of cryptoglandular anal fistula formation [ The aim of this study was to characterize the role of adipose tissue hormones in the pathogenesis of cryptoglandular anal fistula, with the specific aims of characterizing the potential role of the proinflammatory, EMT, and ECM factors responsible for the development of chronic inflammation. The analyzed group included 31 men (51.7%) at a mean age of 41.4 \u00b1 11.3 years and 29 women (48.3%) at a mean age of 44.8 \u00b1 13.9 years.  In our study, we analyzed the levels of adipokines in tissues collected from cryptoglandular fistulas. Patients with complex fistulas were characterized by significantly higher levels of leptin and resistin compared to patients with simple fistulas (respectively, 22 \u00b1 8.07 ng/mL vs. 12.77 \u00b1 9.3 ng/mL,  In our study, there were no statistically significant differences between simple and complex perianal fistula patients in levels of tissue zinc-finger protein SNAI1 (Snail) (515.1 \u00b1 311.2 pg/mL vs. 542.9 \u00b1 303.2 pg/mL,  Individual variables were next analyzed for correlations with tissue concentrations of selected adipokines (leptin, resistin, and adiponectin) with E-cadherin, MMP2, and MMP9. The leptin levels negatively correlated with E-cadherin levels (r = \u22120.3493;  In recent studies conducted in patients with a persistent anal fistulas after surgical intervention, an incomplete healing of the fistula was observed at the site of the original internal fistula opening [ The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been described in normal and neoplastic processes, including wound healing. Recently, an abnormal integrity of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and EMT has been observed in several human physiological and pathological processes, and its potential role has been shown in the development of cryptoglandular anal fistulas and fistula formation related to Crohn\u2019s disease [ The EMT, through stimulating chronic inflammation and the release of proinflammatory cytokines, could then lead to an increased migration of epithelial cells which could contribute to fistula formation [ The gelatinases A (MMP-2) and B (MMP-9) are found among others in the gastrointestinal tract and have been shown to be highly upregulated in the large intestine during inflammatory processes [ Decreased MMP-",

      "findings_text": "Anorectal fistula is a relatively common, chronic connection between the anal canal and perianal skin [ The most commonly-accepted cause of anal fistula is that anal glands, which lie between the internal and external sphincters [ Since anorectal fistulas vary in presentation as well as severity, similar to other anorectal diseases, the true prevalence of anorectal fistula is not exact, but estimated to be around 16\u201337\u00a0% of all patients presenting with anorectal abscesses [ Any patient with concern for an anorectal fistula should first be evaluated with a detailed history and physical exam to determine the chronicity, symptoms, and other associated gastrointestinal, genitourinary, gynecological, and skin symptoms. The critical part is a physical examination of the anal canal to determine the fistula anatomy relative to the anal sphincters ( Types of anorectal fistulas, their anatomy, prevalence, treatment options and success rates. Cross-sectional images credits belong to The ASCRS Textbook of Colon and Rectal Surgery, 4th edition [ In cases of recurrent or occult fistula, or high suspicion for complexity (especially secondary to Crohn's disease), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or endoanal ultrasound (EAUS) can be used as adjuncts to help define the anatomy. MRI has been shown to correlate with operative/clinical findings in 82\u00a0% of anorectal fistulas [ Although surgical treatment is mainstay of therapy, having a good understanding of the anatomy is vital [ Goal of surgical treatment for anal fistula is definitive treatment by closure, obliteration, or excision of the fistula tract, and the main priority is to avoid immediate fecal incontinence. While the fecal continence mechanism is complex, this loosely translates to a priority to preserve the external sphincter muscle across most approaches. The risk for post-operative anal sphincter dysfunction is typically when the anatomy is distorted, including recurrent or complex fistulas, previous anorectal surgeries, and female sex [ While treatment options available for any given situation may be many \u2013 seton placement, fistulotomy, fibrin glue injections, fistula plug, and advancement flaps \u2013 most surgeons have a few techniques they are comfortable with, and tailor these to the patient's situation and anatomy of the fistula. For submucosal or simple intersphincteric fistulas, treatment is fistulotomy and healing by secondary intention is typically associated with low recurrence and complications [ For deeper fistulas, involving the external sphincter muscle or having complexity like branching or extensive infection, the surgeon may opt for seton placement. A draining seton can provide symptomatic relief as well as decrease of inflammation, edema, or infection to allow for staged operative interventions. After identifying the fistula anatomy with the fistula probe as above, the extent of muscle involved or clinical situation (multiple branches, extensive infection, etc) are felt to be too involved ",

      "findings_text": "Anal fistula is a type of common perianal inflammatory disease that is second only to hemorrhoids in prevalence and accounts for 3% of all anorectal diseases [ The main treatment method for anal fistula is surgical therapy [ MRI has been identified as the preferred diagnostic method for detecting anal fistula with high specificity and sensitivity. Pelvic ultrasonography has been proposed as a low-cost, easily accessible, noninvasive and accurate tool for dynamic and static assessment of anal canal anatomy and function. Multislice imaging is now possible with the introduction of three-dimensional ultrasound [ This is a retrospective analysis of 67 patients with suspected anal fistula who underwent surgery between May 2021 and July 2022. The enrolled patients included 62 men and 5 women with a mean age of 35.40\u2009\u00b1\u200913.29 (16\u201368). The scheme was conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Jiaotong University. Patients who defaulted to preoperative pelvic 3D US and MRI were excluded from the study. Exclusion criteria were: (1) patients who underwent seton treatment or surgery before pelvic 3D US and MRI; (2) patients with serious or uncontrolled infection, low endurance for US and MRI, and severe cardiopulmonary dysfunction and disorder. The pelvic 3D US technique (WS80A; Samsung Medical) was used to obtain high-resolution images of the complex anatomy of sphincter and anal canal. A rotating probe (CA1-8A; Samsung Medical) was used to obtain 360\u00b0 US images of the area of interest from patients in a left lateral position and lithotomy position. Patients were examined in a eupneic supine position. T1-weighted (T1W1) and T2-weighted (T2W2) sequences on a 3.0 Tesla scanner (Philips Ingenia) were used to obtain images of three orthogonal imaging planes (sagittal, coronal and axial). The position and number of internal openings, major fistula trend and Parks classification were documented in the above examination. The pelvic 3D US and MRI were analyzed and evaluated by two experienced doctors with more than 10\u00a0years of experience. An anal fistula is a low echo duct that connects the anal canal or rectum to the perianal skin, with one or more internal openings, sometimes accompanied by one or two external openings. When tracing an anechoic or hypoechoic zone inward, the pelvic 3D US image of a fistula shows an anechoic or hypoechoic zone with internal openings. The US image of internal openings shows local mucosal depression, local mucosal protrusion or mucous membrane disruption. The external and internal anal sphincters appear as two concentric rings, with the external anal sphincter as a hyperechoic outer layer and the internal anal sphincter as a hypoechoic inner layer. The fistula and its branches are present in T1W1 as streaks with low or equal signal intensity. The fistula is on one side of the internal opening, while the rectal cavity is on the other side. MRI suggests local mucosal disruption and protrusi",

This was a retrospective cohort study based on the data of patients with perianal fistulizing CD from 1 March 2020 to 31 October 2022 at the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University (Guangzhou, China). This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Sun Yat-Sen University (2021ZSLYEC-066) and the Clinical Trial Registry ( Consecutive patients meeting the following inclusion criteria were included: First, patients underwent comprehensive screening and diagnosis for CD according to internationally accepted criteria [ All patients were first infused with intravenous UST (260 mg for those weighing <55 kg, 520 mg for those weighing >85 kg, and 390 mg for those weighing between 55\u201385 kg) and subcutaneous UST (90 mg every 8 or 12 weeks) afterward [ CD was classified using the widely accepted Montreal classification system [ MRI was performed to evaluate the fistula status. The number of fistulas, anatomicalclassification, hyperintensity on the fat-saturated T2 sequence, and track thickness and volume were recorded. A simple fistula was defined as a superficial/inter-sphincteric/trans-sphincteric fistula with only one track, without extension or abscess. Complex fistulas were defined as inter-sphincteric/trans-sphincteric fistulas with more than one track, or supra-sphincteric/extra-sphincteric/rectovaginal fistula [ Continuous data were presented as mean \u00b1 standard error (S.D.E) or median with interquartile range (IQR), while categorical data were presented as percentages.

Perianal abscesses often require surgical incision and drainage, potentially followed by seton or catheter placement and antibiotics. The decision to perform surgery, especially for pediatric patients with complex CPF, is based on a number of psychosocial, developmental, and anatomic considerations ( This is a HIPAA compliant, institutional review board approved, retrospective, single institution study. From 2010 to 2020, all pediatric patients, who had perianal CD diagnosis and showed fistulizing perianal involvement on their first pelvic MRI performed for perianal assessment, were identified using an institutional radiology report database. Data were extracted from the electronic medical records, and MR images were then reviewed. Patients were excluded if (1) they did not have a diagnosis of CD based on the colonoscopy, or (2) perianal fistula was not detected on pelvic MRI. MRI examinations were performed using a 1.5\u2005T magnet (HD Excite; GE Healthcare, USA) or on a 3\u2005T scanner (Magnetom Trio; Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) with a 16-channel phased-array coil. The standard MR protocol involves a tri-plane localizer followed by triplane fast spin-echo T2-weighted images using a full field of view (FOV) through the entire pelvis, small FOV short tau inversion recovery (STIR) images through the perianal region in the axial and coronal planes, T1-W fat suppressed 3-D gradient echo images before and after administration of intravenous contrast agent in the coronal and axial planes, as well as T1-W fat-suppressed high-resolution 2-D spoiled gradient echo axial delayed images post-contrast administration ( All pelvic MRI exams were reviewed by a radiologist, blinded to the image findings and disease diagnosis, with subspecialty training in pediatric and abdominal radiology with 12 years of experience reading pelvis MRI.

[ The study was conducted at a referral center in India, which deals exclusively with anal fistulas. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and written informed consent was obtained from all the patients. Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the Indus International Hospital (No. EC/IIH-IEC/SP6). In a prospective study, all consecutive patients operated for anal fistula over 8 months from July 2020 to February 2021, and who had preoperative and postoperative magnetic resonance imag\u00ading (MRI) to assess fistula healing at 3 months postoperatively, were included. Only patients with cryptoglandular fistulas were included, and patients with Crohn disease were excluded. Long-term clinical healing was defined as complete healing of all the fistula tracts (complete cessation of pus discharge from the anus as well as all the external openings) with a minimum follow-up of at least 1 year. If there was pus discharge from even a single tract, then the fistula was considered nonhealing. All the MRI scans were interpreted independently by 2 experts who had extensive experience in analyzing fistula MRI scans, including the MRI done in the postoperative period [ The fistulas were classified under the Parks classification and St James\u2019s University Hospital (SJUH) classification. The fistulas in early grades (Parks I or SJUH I\u2013II) were classified as simple fistulas and higher grades (Parks II or SJUH III\u2013V) were categorized as complex fistulas. Fistulotomy was performed for simple fistulas, and transanal opening of intersphincteric space (TROPIS) was performed for complex fistulas [ Six parameters were assessed as per the GSS postoperatively 3 months after surgery. Out of 6, 4 parameters were MRI-based (to be assessed on postoperative MRI), and 2 were clinical ( The MRI-based parameters were healing of the internal (primary) opening (healed, 0; not healed, 4), healing of the fistula tract in the intersphincteric space (healed, 0; not healed, 4), healing of the external tracts in the ischiorectal fossa (healed, 0; not healed, 1), and development of a new abscess in intersphincteric space in the postoperative period (on MRI) (absent, 0; present, 4).

      "title": "Non-Locatable Internal Opening in Anal Fistula Associated with Acute Abscess and Its Definitive Management by Garg Protocol",
      "clinical_history": "",
      "findings_text": "Anal fistula management is challenging because of the high rate of recurrence and the risk of incontinence due to sphincter damage. The two challenges are (1) the definitive treatment of anal fistula associated with acute abscess (acute fistula-abscess) and (2) managing fistulas in which the internal opening (IO) is non-locatable (IO non-locatable). The challenge is magnified when these problems co-exist - \u201cIO non-locatable\u201d in patients with acute fistula-abscess. There is no literature on the management of such patients and this scenario is analyzed in this study. Conventionally, in patients with acute fistula-abscess, the abscess is drained to bring sepsis under control and the fistula is tackled later at a second operation. However, evidence shows that definitive management of acute anal fistula-abscess at the first operation is possible with comparable success and no risk to continence. There are several reasons for the recurrence of anal fistulas. \n Anorectal abscess developing in a patient known to have an anal fistula: The patient may or may not have been operated previously for the fistula Anorectal abscess as the first presentation: There are two possibilities:\n Communication with the anus seen on MRI ie, internal opening locatable (Fistula confirmed) No fistula tract or internal opening locatable (Fistula not confirmed): In this subset, there is a possibility that an anal fistula may not develop). Incidentally, in acute fistula-abscess patients, the likelihood of the IO being non-locatable is higher than in routine fistulas. This happens because inflammation makes clinical examination difficult, and swelling around the internal opening may temporarily occlude it. This has been identified as a major bottleneck in the definitive management of acute anal fistula-abscess. Patients with acute fistula-abscess operated over a six-year period between 2015 and 2021 and who underwent definitive management at the first surgery were included. Indus International Hospital-Institute Ethics Committee (IIH-IEC) granted approval for the study (approval number EC/IIH-IEH/SP6). The patients were informed about the purpose of the study, written informed consent was taken and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. In this study, all different types of acute fistula-abscess patients (anorectal abscess as the first presentation, or developing in a patient with known anal fistula) were managed by definitive surgery and were included. Preoperative MRI was done in all the patients. This was done as our center is a referral center for anal fistulas due to which the proportion of complex fistulas is higher. Moreover, as MRI scan is quite economical in India (60\u201380 USD), patients can easily afford it. Endoanal ultrasonography was not done as the authors\u2019 experience in MRI is extensive but minimal in ultrasonography.

In particular, when used as a followup imaging modality for Crohn's disease, which requires frequent scans at short intervals, the burden on patients may increase. Furthermore, sedatives are necessary for young children or patients with claustrophobia, and MRI requires gadolinium-based contrast agents, which are associated with a risk of complications, such as brain deposition or nephrotic systemic fibrosis. Transperineal ultrasonography (TPUS) is a simple, real-time, and practical examination that does not require specific patient preparation. Compared with pelvic MRI, TPUS has the advantages of being inexpensive, noninvasive, widely available, and safe [ This retrospective study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, which waived the requirement for informed consent (IRB No. B-2105-687-102).

Definitive management is perhaps mistakenly perceived as a \u2018low acuity\u2019 or \u2018simple\u2019 incision and drainage of sepsis, often delegated to the junior trainee or performed after\u2010hours. While this approach may apply to abscesses elsewhere on the body, the intricate sphincter anatomy can be deceiving as evidenced by the fact that one\u2010third will re\u2010present with fistula in ano. The purpose of this study therefore is to evaluate the current trend of perianal abscess management at our institution, and identify clinical or operative factors which can assist trainees reduce subsequent fistula formation or abscess recurrence. All acute patients admitted to a major teaching hospital who required surgical drainage of a perianal abscess were analysed over a 2\u2010year period from January 2019 to December 2020. Patient demographics, clinical and laboratory findings were retrospectively reviewed. Proceduralist experience and operative strategy were documented. Searching for a fistula tract was defined as using an anal retractor and gently passing a Lockhart\u2010Mummery probe or instillation of hydrogen peroxide and identifying an internal opening. A recurrence was defined as a previous or subsequent presentation with a perianal abscess requiring surgery, or a subsequent examination under anaesthesia which identified a fistula tract.

The operating surgeons need to understand the exact position of the anal fistula and its relation to the anatomical structures in order to achieve high cure rate especially in complex anal fistulas. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard investigation used for anal fistulas. Usually, the MRI is interpreted by the radiologists who then send a written report to the operating surgeon and the surgeon performs the surgery after reading the radiologist\u2019s report. Formats have been suggested for reporting the MRI in fistulas[ Format for the written magnetic resonance imaging report SJUH- St James\u2019s University Hospital classification. Report: The primary fistula tract is opening in perianal skin at 7 o\u2019clock position. It extends superiorly in right ischiorectal fossa from 7 to 8 o\u2019clock position for a length of 6.35 cm and penetrates the external anal sphincter (EAS) at 8 o\u2019clock position involving approximately two-thirds of the EAS. It then bends inferiorly and follows an intersphincteric route from 8 to 6 o\u2019clock and opens in the anal canal at the level of dentate line. There are no secondary extensions of primary tract.

No secondary tract, abscess or supralevator extensions. Parks grade -II, SJUH grade III.  First, when only a written report is sent by the radiologist who has analyzed the MRI scans, then a lot of important information is lost. This happens because the three-dimensional picture created in the radiologist\u2019s mind by the detailed visual analysis of the MRI scans cannot be replicated in the surgeon\u2019s mind just by reading the text in the radiologist\u2019s report. This loss of three-dimensional visual data can be prevented by sending a small video highlighting all relevant parameters along with the written report. Second, as discussed, the two main concerns in anal fistulas are recurrence and incontinence[ \n As the origin of most fistulas is at the level of the dentate line, the location of the internal opening in most of them is at that level only. The location of the internal opening does not accurately correspond to the amount of involvement of the EAS as penetration of the EAS by the fistula is often at a different level (Figure  The level of understanding of fistula anatomy is greatly enhanced in the surgeon\u2019s mind when a small video of MRI scan showing the fistula characteristics is send along with the written report ( Format for reporting the fistula magnetic resonance imaging in the video As can be seen, the novel parameter reported in this study, HOPE (height of penetration of external an",

The role of sepsis in the intersphincteric space, the space between the internal and the external sphincters, has been known for several decades. Over the last few years, proper eradication of sepsis in the intersphincteric has been shown to improve success rates in complex fistulas. Conventionally, it is believed that in the sphincter complex (the internal and the external sphincters) there is only one potential space through which a fistula (pus/sepsis) extends. This is the space between the two sphincters (intersphincteric space) ( Schematic diagram showing intersphincteric and outer-sphincteric spaces. However, the recent availability of high-resolution MRI has enabled a detailed evaluation of complex anal fistulas and their relation to the sphincter complex. It seems that apart from the conventional intersphincteric space, there is another space lateral (outside) to this space, between the external sphincter and its external fascia (named as \u201couter-sphincteric space\u201d in this manuscript) ( In a retrospective study, the MRI scans of patients operated on intersphincteric abscesses over a four-year period were studied. A team comprising of operating surgeons and the consulting radiologist assessed the MRI scans. Features analyzed included whether the external sphincter could be seen lateral to the intersphincteric abscess/tract or not, extension of the abscess/tract to the ischiorectal fossa or the supralevator space, and whether it was possible to drain or lay open the abscess into the rectum through the transanal route.

At this stage, both hand\u2010sewn and stapled anastomoses are theoretically possible, and the choice between them is at the surgeon's discretion. For hand\u2010sewn cases, a transanal approach was adopted after total mesenteric excision. Circumferential mucosal and muscular incisions were made at least 1\u2009cm below the tumor margin, followed by rectal closure using the purse\u2010string suture technique. Intersphincteric dissection between the puborectalis and internal sphincters was meticulously performed, and the specimen was extracted. After sufficient intrapelvic irrigation to prevent tumor implantation, hand\u2010sewn end\u2010to\u2010end coloanal anastomosis was performed. For stapled cases, rectal transection was performed using an automated linear stapler with an adequate distal margin. Subsequently, coloanal anastomosis was performed using a circular stapler and double\u2010stapling technique. The creation of a diverting stoma was at the surgeon's discretion. Post\u2010operative outcomes were divided into post\u2010operative course and post\u2010operative complications (Clavien\u2013Dindo classification grade III or higher). Post\u2010operative complications were further categorized into early post\u2010operative complications, occurring from the end of surgery to 1\u2009month postoperatively, and late post\u2010operative complications, occurring from 1\u2009month to 3\u2009years postoperatively.

Recent studies report incidences of CRVF after low anterior resection for rectal cancer between 1.6% and 5.1%, depending on the definition and the observation interval Management of CRVF is challenging due to the fact that the fistula remains a route of least resistance, prohibiting spontaneous healing in the presence of a competent internal sphincter. Management options for CRVF include conservative treatment (for example antibiotics), local endoscopic intervention (for example clipping, endosponge), local closure, and more invasive approaches, such as redo colorectal anastomosis, or dismantling or intersphincteric resection of the anastomosis with construction of an end colostomy Hence, the aim of this study was to examine the characteristics and treatment of patients with CRVF after rectal cancer resection in a large, international, multicentre database of patients with anastomotic leakage (AL), and to compare treatment and outcomes after AL in female patients without CRVF The TENTACLE\u2013Rectum study (TreatmENT of AnastomotiC LeakagE after rectal cancer resection) was an international, multicentre, retrospective cohort study involving 216 centres from 45 countries that included 2470 patients with AL after rectal cancer resection Patients with rectal cancer operated between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2018 were eligible for the TENTACLE\u2013Rectum study if they were diagnosed with AL within 1\u2005year after surgery.

Adequate hydration (at least two liters of water daily at rest) and proper fiber intake are essential components of conservative management and play a crucial role in relieving symptoms and preventing progression to chronicity. A chronic anal fissure (CAF) is diagnosed if symptoms persist after six weeks of medical treatment or show intermittent improvement with recurrence. Conversion to CAFs occurs in 40% of acute anal fissures. The rupture in CAFs is deeper than that in acute anal fissures, and internal anal sphincter fibers are observed at the base of the fissure. Hardened chronic fissures, hypertrophic anal papillae proximally, and skin tags distally constitute the classic triad of CAFs. The exact etiology remains unclear, but contributing factors include trauma from hard stools, reduced posterior anal canal blood supply, and increased internal anal canal pressure. Surgical intervention is the preferred treatment for CAF. Lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS), advancement flaps, and fissurectomy are commonly used, with LIS being the gold standard [ Numerous randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the superiority of LIS over topical nitrates, calcium channel blockers, and Botox for the treatment of primary CAFs. The remission rate is 88\u2013100% and is considered the most effective treatment for primary CAFs [ This prospective study was conducted in the general surgery clinic of Istanbul University-Cerrahpa\u015fa, Cerrahpa\u015fa Medical Faculty Hospital between 2021 and 2022.

This can be preceded by neoadjuvant therapy such as chemoradiotherapy or adjuvant therapy with postoperative chemotherapy, considering multiple factors such as tumor size and location, clinical stage, and surgical procedure to be performed [ In the surgical management of RC with curative intent, the choice of surgical approach will depend on the tumor's height in relation to the anal margin (AM), the involvement of adjacent structures (levator ani muscles, seminal glands, and bladder), and the involvement of the anal sphincter complex. The main transabdominal surgical procedures used for the resection of RC, with subsequent primary anastomosis and sphincter preservation, are low anterior resection (LAR) with colorectal anastomosis for patients with tumors in the upper third of the rectum, and ultra-low anterior resection (ULAR) with coloanal anastomosis, with or without intersphincteric dissection, for patients with tumors in the middle or lower thirds of the rectum [ It is important to consider the potential postoperative adverse results that significantly increase morbidity and mortality in RC surgery procedures. Anastomotic leak (AL) is one of the most severe complications in patients undergoing RC surgery. The incidence of AL in this specific population ranges from 3% to 36.3% [ Multiple studies in the literature have identified numerous risk factors associated with the development of AL after colorectal surgery and can be divided into patient-, disease- and treatment-related factors.

An advantage of ESD is its precise incision of a tumor margin under endoscopic view, and an advantage of LE is its ability to excise skin beyond the dentate line. Thus, we hypothesized that combining ESD and LE could be effective for excising tumors broadly extending beyond the dentate line. We dubbed this combination therapy as transanal endoscopy cooperative surgery (TaECS) and examined its usefulness in this study. In this case series, consecutive patients who had undergone TaECS at a Japanese tertiary cancer center between January and December 2022 were enrolled. We evaluated lesion characteristics and clinical outcomes based on data obtained from medical records and the patient database. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shizuoka Cancer Center Institutional\nReview Board, Shizuoka, Japan (No. J2023-175-2023-1) and was performed according to the 1964\nHelsinki Declaration and its subsequent amendments. Written informed consent for\ninterventions was obtained from all participants before undergoing treatment. TECS was indicated for local resection of tumors extending beyond the dentate line with a low risk of lymph node metastases (LNM), which could not be resected by ESD alone due to the requirement for skin excision or by surgical LE alone due to indeterminate lesion extent on the oral side under direct observation.

Preoperative diagnosis was based on magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging (ME-NBI) and chromoendoscopy findings. To confirm the extent of tumor in the horizontal axis, tumor margins were carefully evaluated, and biopsies were taken from outside the lesion to ensure the resection margin in cases where the lesion extent was indeterminate. Furthermore, we estimated lesion depth using contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to confirm absence of LNM and distant metastases. In all cases, a consensus was reached prior to performing a procedure at a cancer board conference attended by endoscopists, gastrointestinal surgeons, gynecologists, dermatologists, and oncologists. TaECS was performed in an operating room after ensuring adequate bowel preparation. TaECS was initiated by endoscopic procedure with left lateral decubitus under intravenous (IV) anesthesia. Subsequently, surgical procedure was performed via lithotomy or jack-knife position in general anesthesia. Endoscopic procedure was performed using a colonoscope with a water-jet system (PCF-H290T; Olympus Co, Ltd.) fitted with a clear distal at",

PFCD may develop in up to 43% of patients with CD [ Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely recognized as the gold standard for identifying various types of anal fistulas [ Given the correlation between the PFCD lesion region and surrounding tissues, the model must be equipped with adequate global feature extraction capabilities. Thus, Vision Transformer (ViT) [ Heat maps of anal fistula image visualization based on different recognition models As a result, ViT was combined with the MobileNet Convolutional neural network (CNN). This integration enables the model to capture both global and local features with increased precision in regions of interest. This paper introduces CVT-HNet fusion network, which utilizes high-resolution anal fistula MRI. By incorporating residual structures, depthwise separable convolution, and Coordinate Attention (CA) mechanism [ CVT-HNet fusion model, which integrates CNN and ViT architectures, is proposed for the accurate classification of PFCD and CAF based on high-resolution anal MRI. This work represents an early attempt to apply hybrid networks to this specific clinical task. CVT-HNet employs a customized MV2-CA module with h-swish activation to enhance non-linearity without compromising computational efficiency. By interleaving MV2-CA and Transformer layers, CVT-HNet effectively fuses local and global features for precise detection of subtle anal fistula variations in MRI scans. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated through comparative experiments and external validation. These assessments involve comparisons with both original Transformer models and hybrid networks. The contribution of each component module of CVT-HNet is evaluated through ablation experiments. Heat maps are used to assess the variations in network attention within anal fistula images across different models. CNNs have been widely used in medical image classification for their effective local feature extraction. Recent studies include Balasubramaniam et al.

It is used to repair low-complex rectovaginal fistulas. \n \n The Martius flap effectively repairs mid-complex and early RVFs. An ostomy is not always required, and pelvic radiation is the primary cause of recurrence.  Rectovaginal fistula (RVF) is a rare surgical condition that poses significant management challenges. It accounts for approximately 5% of all anorectal fistulas,  This retrospective cohort study included patients who underwent RVF surgery at Shahid Faghihi Hospital, a tertiary referral colorectal center (Shiraz, Iran), between 2013 and 2023. The exclusion criteria were active malignancy, inflammatory bowel diseases, a lack of routine postoperative follow-up, and other types of surgical techniques. All surgeries were performed by a single expert colorectal surgeon. Postoperative follow-ups were routinely scheduled at 3, 6, and 12 months, with annual visits thereafter. Each visit included a comprehensive medical history, physical examination, and imaging studies as needed. Fistula recurrence was defined as the passage of gas, feces, or mucosal discharge from the vagina postoperatively. If the patient\u2019s history and physical examination did not confirm recurrence, CT or MRI with rectal contrast was performed. We collected demographic information, past medical history, the site, size, and cause of the fistula, the status of the anal sphincter, the operation time, the duration of hospital stay, previous surgeries for fistula repair, and ostomy status from medical records. Additionally, postoperative complications were recorded using the Clavien-Dindo classification.  Prior to data collection, written informed consent was obtained from the patients. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (code: IR.SUMS.REC.1403.149). Complete mechanical bowel preparation was performed prior to the surgery. A single dose of prophylactic antibiotics was administered preoperatively, and a Foley catheter was inserted. Following the induction of general or spinal anesthesia, the patient was positioned in the lithotomy position. A transverse perineal incision was placed. In cases of narrow perineum, a bilateral V-shaped incision was utilized for Z-plasty. To minimize bleeding, 1% lidocaine (Lignodic; Caspian, Iran) with epinephrine (Darou Pakhsh Co., Iran) in a 1:200000 dilution was injected into the rectovaginal septum. Sharp dissection was performed to separate the posterior wall of the vagina from the anterior wall of the rectum. The dissection was continued until the fistula tract was completely released, extending at least 2 cm proximal to the cervix. After refreshing the edges of the fistula, the rectal defect was closed transversely using 3-0 PDS sutures (Ethicon, Cincinnati, USA).

      "clinical_history": "",
      "findings_text": "In the field of colorectal and anal surgery, perianal abscesses and anal fistulas are among the most common diseases. Clinically, when anal glands get blocked (commonly by fecal matter, foreign bodies, or due to local trauma) and infected, mainly by bacteria, an abscess forms. This leads to perianal swelling and pain, which is diagnosed as a perianal abscess. If the abscess ruptures spontaneously or persistent infection remains after drainage, it often progresses into an anal fistula. Significantly, these two diseases frequently coexist, posing a major clinical challenge ( The formation of a perianal abscess starts with an infection in the anal glands within the anal canal. As the infection spreads, the body\u2019s immune response kicks in, causing inflammation and the accumulation of pus, creating pressure and pain. Left untreated, the abscess may expand and rupture, potentially resulting in a fistula, an abnormal connection between the anal canal and the surrounding skin ( According to previous studies, 90% of perianal abscesses are caused by infection of the anal glands (cryptoglandular infection) ( Previous studies have primarily focused on culturing abscesses to identify the bacteria present. For instance,  However, traditional culture methods have led to limited comparative analyses and have exhibited various drawbacks. Advancements in sequencing techniques, such as high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing, have enabled the detection of a large number of microbial community samples, thus providing rich data for analysis. Additionally, high-throughput sequencing allows for the study of diversity and classification of microbes, including those that cannot be cultured using traditional methods. Therefore, based on this sequencing technology, the microbial composition characteristics and significant biomarkers of perianal abscess can be comprehensively studied ( This study utilized high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing to analyze bacterial communities in perianal abscesses and compared them with those in anal skin and fecal samples from the same individuals to understand the potential sources of infecting microbes.

These fistulas commonly result from cryptoglandular infections but may also arise from other etiologies, such as Crohn\u2019s disease, tuberculosis, trauma, or malignancies.[ Historically, the diagnosis and management of anorectal fistulas have relied on clinical examination and surgical exploration. Digital rectal examination and anoscopy remain fundamental diagnostic tools; however, their ability to accurately map fistulous tracts and identify internal openings is often limited, especially in complex cases.[ MRI offers several advantages in the evaluation of anorectal fistulas. It allows for precise localization of the fistulous tract, identification of the internal opening, and detection of secondary complications such as abscesses or horseshoe extensions. These detailed anatomical assessments are crucial for preoperative planning, as they guide surgical interventions to minimize recurrence and preserve continence.[ Despite these advancements, discrepancies between MRI and intraoperative findings persist, particularly in detecting small secondary tracts or undetected abscesses. This underscores the importance of combining high-resolution imaging with thorough intraoperative examination to achieve optimal outcomes.[ This prospective study was conducted at Pt. JNM Medical College and DR. B.R. Ambedkar Memorial Hospital, Raipur, India, between April 2018 and September 2019.

Ethical approval was obtained, and all patients provided written informed consent. \n Patients aged 18 years or older with a confirmed diagnosis of anorectal fistula. \n Patients with contraindications for MRI or those unable to undergo surgery. All patients underwent preoperative MRI using a 1.0 Tesla Siemens MRI machine. The protocol included T1-weighted, T2-weighted, STIR sequences, and fat-suppressed contrast-enhanced images to evaluate fistulous tracts, internal openings, abscesses, and extensions. The internal opening was identified using the anal clock, with 12 o\u2019clock position as anterior. Surgery was performed under anesthesia, and fistulous tracts were delineated using methylene blue dye. Depending on the complexity of the fistula, either fistulotomy or fistulectomy was performed. Surgical findings included the type of fistula, internal opening, and the presence of abscesses or secondary tracts. MRI findings were compared to intraoperative findings, which served as the diagnostic gold standard.

The standard surgical procedures in the management of perianal fistula include seton placement and fistulectomy[ Long-standing CD carries a significant risk of cancer development, particularly squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Patients with CD have a 4- to 20-fold increased risk of colorectal carcinoma[ MRI demonstrates utility not only for evaluation of fistulizing disease, but also in the diagnosis of perianal carcinoma. Characteristic MRI findings suggestive of perianal neoplasia in patients include irregular inner wall morphology, delayed enhancement of internal tissue, and mucinous patterns. While the fistula wall is frequently observed, this finding alone is insufficient to differentiate cancer from inflammation. Additionally, a distinct double-layered enhancement pattern characterized by an early bright external wall enhancement contrasting with a darker delayed-enhancing internal wall may be observed[ Perianal fistulas in CD, which can affect the small and large intestines, are characterized by narrow squamous epithelial cells. These cells undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition to become transition cells in response to immunological triggers or bacterial invasion. As a result, the cells lose their phenotypic and functional properties such as polarity and adhesiveness, while acquiring mesenchymal cell traits. This leads to reduced cell-to-cell adhesion and enhanced migratory activity[ \n Immunohistochemical analyses of CD-related perianal fistulas indicate acute inflammation in 56% of cases[ Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play crucial roles in tissue degradation and remodeling.

Perianal abscesses typically occur during infancy and often resolve by the age of one year. However, pediatricians should remain vigilant for the possibility of CD when perianal abscesses present outside the usual age range. Diagnosing CD as the underlying cause of anal fistulas typically requires gastrointestinal endoscopy. However, characteristic findings of CD, such as longitudinal ulcers or cobblestone patterns, may not always be evident on endoscopy [ Treatment of perianal abscesses and fistulas associated with CD often involves antibiotics, biological therapies, and surgical interventions such as seton drainage. While the efficacy of enteral nutritional therapy for perianal fistulas has not been firmly established, there are reports suggesting its potential benefits. Here, we report the case of a pediatric patient with a refractory anal fistula that led to a diagnosis of CD despite the absence of abnormal endoscopic findings. Notably, in this case, the refractory anal fistula was successfully treated with partial enteral nutrition (PEN) therapy alone, and remission has been maintained for over 1.5 years. A three-year-old boy presented with redness, swelling, and pain in his buttocks, followed by drainage, and was referred to the pediatric surgery department of our hospital with suspected perianal fistulas, three weeks after the onset of anal symptoms.

However, reported success rates range widely\u2014from 16% to 80%\u2014depending on surgical technique, fistula complexity, and patient-specific factors [ Here, we report the case of a high-risk patient with Crohn\u2019s-related RVF who had successful healing following Martius flap repair, emphasizing the importance of tailored, multidisciplinary management in this rare and complex condition. A 12-year-old girl with a known history of CD presented with the passage of gas and stool through the vagina, consistent with a RVF. EUA revealed a distal RVF, clearly visible and easily probed ( Rectovaginal fistula visible at clinical examination under anesthesia (arrow pointing the vaginal orifice of the fistula). Introduction of a stylet through the vaginal orifice and advanced into the fistulous tract, demonstrated direct communication with the rectum, confirming the diagnosis. Given the unfavorable conditions for healing\u2014including active perianal disease, stenosis, and poor tissue quality\u2014a protective ileostomy was performed to divert fecal flow and optimize the local environment prior to definitive surgical repair. Once the inflammation was controlled and local conditions improved, a Martius flap procedure was undertaken. The most crucial steps of the surgical procedure included dissection of the fistula ( Perioperative image showing the fistulous tract after dissection of the subcutaneous tissue. Perioperative images showing the dissection of the Martius flap (A) and its placement between the vagina and the rectum (B). RVFs in CD remain one of the most complex and frustrating challenges in colorectal surgery, not only due to their anatomical complexity but also because of their profound physical and psychosocial impact [ Although medical therapy can help reduce local inflammation, it often fails to achieve fistula healing, particularly in RVFs [ This case highlights the successful use of a staged approach involving fecal diversion followed by Martius flap interposition for RVF in a 12-year-old girl with CD. The role of fecal diversion in surgical success remains controversial. Some authors report that diverting the fecal stream offers no statistically significant benefit to fistula closure rates [ In our case, the decision to perform a diverting ileostomy was based on active perianal disease and rectal stenosis, both of which are known to impair healing outcomes.

This study also aimed to describe the clinical presentations, diagnostic approaches, surgical management, and postoperative complications that can occur during colovesical fistula repair. A literature review and national database analysis were conducted to compare patient demographics and postoperative outcomes between open and minimally invasive surgical approaches for colovesical fistula repair. A total of 2765 patients hospitalized with the diagnostic code enterovesical fistula (EVF) were included using the national database analysis. Data were extracted covering the years 2016\u20132022. A 1:1 propensity score-matched analysis was conducted comparing patients who underwent open colovesical fistula repair ( A retrospective chart review was performed to obtain two representative case reports of colovesical fistula from our clinical practice. Both patients underwent surgical intervention for colovesical fistulas secondary to sigmoid diverticulitis.

A 50-year-old man underwent the creation of a stoma with double orifices in the sigmoid colon via an intraperitoneal route for ulcerative colitis and a complex anal fistula 16 years prior. Nine years previously, he developed a parastomal hernia but was kept under observation because of multiple comorbidities. However, the hernia gradually grew larger, making it difficult to manage the stoma; therefore, he presented for consideration of a hernia repair. The patient lived with his brother who cooked most of his meals, making it difficult for him to strictly manage his diet. Additionally, hemiparesis secondary to cerebral infarction limited his ability to participate in adequate physical therapy. Inpatient management was also challenging because our hospital lacks an obesity treatment specialist, and his history of schizophrenia made it difficult to find another facility willing to accept him. Furthermore, continuation of treatment after discharge was anticipated to be difficult, and was therefore discontinued. His medical history included ulcerative colitis, schizophrenia, cerebral and pulmonary infarctions, deep vein thrombosis, and hypertension. The patient had been receiving salazosulfapyridine for ulcerative colitis since disease onset 28 years prior, up until hernia surgery. Endoscopic follow-up had not been performed in recent years due to stoma deformity and the development of a cerebral infarction. However, endoscopic findings from 6 years earlier were consistent with clinical remission. Physical examination revealed that the patient was obese with a height of 167 cm, weight of 85 kg, and BMI of 30.4. In addition, the patient had incomplete right-sided paralysis due to the cerebral infarction. A large parastomal hernia was observed in the left lower abdomen, and the skin around the stoma was thin and eroded ( Blood analysis showed mild hypoalbuminemia (3.5g/dl) and pulmonary function tests revealed a restrictive lung disorder, with a vital capacity of 2.82 L (68.6%).

      "clinical_history": "",
      "findings_text": "Anal stenosis is a pathological narrowing of the anal canal, resulting from either true anatomic stricture or functional hypertonicity of the internal anal sphincter. Anatomic stenosis occurs when the normal anoderm is replaced by fibrotic scar tissue, most commonly following hemorrhoidectomy, which accounts for approximately 90% of cases. A less common but severe cause is chemical-induced anal stenosis, resulting from the application of irritant substances by non-medical practitioners. These corrosive agents cause mucosal burns that heal with fibrosis, leading to progressive stenosis. Despite its clinical significance, chemical-induced anal stenosis is rarely reported in the literature. In resource-limited settings, a shortage of trained healthcare professionals and the widespread reliance on traditional healers contribute to its prevalence [ Diagnosis is primarily clinical, with severity classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on digital examination or assessment with a Hill-Ferguson retractor [ A gentleman, 38 years of age from the state of Bihar in India, presented with a three-month history of progressive difficulty in passing feces and flatus, eventually requiring digital evacuation of feces. This was also accompanied by intermittent abdominal distension. Notably, he had undergone traditional medicine application for hemorrhoidal treatment 4 months prior, which initially resulted in ulceration that subsequently healed with scarring. He had no history of diabetes, smoking, or other chronic illnesses. On examination, his general physical, abdominal, and inguinoscrotal examinations were normal. Perineal examination revealed severe anal stenosis with a circumferential thick scar, preventing even the insertion of the examiner\u2019s little finger. Routine laboratory investigations were within normal limits. Based on clinical findings, a diagnosis of severe anal stenosis was established, and the patient was scheduled for surgical intervention after obtaining consent and explaining the expected postoperative outcomes.

PNF can affect the skin and soft tissues, including the dermis, subcutaneous fat, and fascia, and can extensively invade muscles and other tissues [ NF can be classified into four types according to the different pathogenic microorganisms: Type I (polymicrobial), type II (monomicrobial), type III (Clostridium), and type IV (fungal) [ Early diagnosis and timely intervention is key to the management of PNF [ Based on these findings, we adopted a new surgical procedure called multiple skip incision skin-sparing debridement (MSISSD). This technique allows for the surgical removal of infected tissue to achieve source control while retaining infected but viable skin tissue in situ, thereby overcoming some limitations of traditional surgical debridement. In addition to presenting this skin-sparing debridement technique for PNF, we retrospectively analyzed the efficacy and safety of this surgical approach. This single-center retrospective study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University. Patients with PNF who received MSISSD between January 2021 and August 2024 were included in the study. All surgical procedures were performed by senior anorectal surgeons. A retrospective analysis was conducted on patient characteristics, including sex, age, disease duration, and laboratory risk indicator for necrotizing fasciitis (LRINEC) score, as well as clinical data, including comorbid diseases, length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU LOS), microbiological culture results, number of debridements, LOS, wound healing time, treatment outcomes, and follow-up status. A diagnosis of PNF is primarily based on clinical symptoms, physical signs, laboratory tests, and imaging examinations, which were confirmed by surgical exploration. PNF commonly presents with a triad of swelling, severe pain, and erythema around the perianal, perineal, genital, and adjacent areas [ All patients underwent MSISSD under general anesthesia. The specific procedures were as follows: (1) The patient was placed in the lithotomy position, and the skin of the surgical area was prepped and draped (Fig.\u00a0 \n ( (2) A radial incision was made at the site of obvious perianal redness and swelling or along the skin necrosis, with an incision length of 3\u20135\u00a0cm or according to the area of skin necrosis.

Rectal prolapse can occur at any age[ Surgery is the treatment of choice for patients with a complete rectal prolapse. Numerous surgical options exist for the treatment of complete rectal prolapse, which are categorized into transabdominal and transperineal/transanal approaches based on the surgical technique. \n \n VMR rectopexy key points: At 1-2 cm above the umbilicus, a 1.2 cm incision is made to insert a trocar for insufflation, establishing a pneumoperitoneum at 11-13 mmHg. A 12 mm trocar is inserted at this site as the observation port, with the right McBurney\u2019s point serving as the primary operating port for the surgeon, and the intersection of the right external border of the rectus abdominis muscle with the line of the umbilicus as the secondary operating port. The intersection of the left external border of the rectus abdominis muscle with the line of the umbilicus serves as the primary operating port for the assistant, whereas the left reverse McBurney\u2019s point serves as the secondary operating port. After placing all ports, the patient is adjusted to a head-down, right-side position to explore the pelvis for any adhesions that may affect the surgery; if present, these adhesions must be separated first. The assistant raises the rectum with the left hand and pulls up the sigmoid mesocolon with the right hand to unfold the right sides of the rectum and sigmoid mesocolon, revealing a right-lateral rectal groove. The surgeon incised the peritoneum in the avascular area of the sacral promontory and then moves downward along the right lateral rectal groove to the lowest point of the Douglas pouch before turning to the left side. Attention should be paid to the sacral promontory to identify the right ureter and protect the inferior hypogastric nerve. In female patients, after incision at the lowest point of the Douglas pouch, the loose space between the rectum and vagina is located, and separation is carried out along this space until the lowest point of the rectovaginal septum is reached.

Among the various types of stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells/mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are the most researched, especially for their roles in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering ( As of now, more than 2,300 human clinical trials involving MSCs have been registered, focusing on conditions like osteoarthritis, traumatic brain injury, septic shock, diabetic nephropathy, respiratory infections and tumors.  Over the past decade, there has been a significant shift in understanding that MSCs primarily deliver therapeutic effects by releasing paracrine factors, instead of migrating and differentiating in injured tissues ( The distinct benefits of EVs compared to conventional stem cell therapies include ( Clinical trials of mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles therapy.

It then proposes feasible improvement methods to provide new ideas for future clinical translation. EVs are vesicles with a double-layer lipid membrane produced by cells. They facilitate intercellular communication and play significant roles in both physiological and pathological contexts. EVs can be classified into three main types based on their biological origin ( The biogenesis of EVs includes four stages: initiation, endocytosis, formation of multivesicular bodies, and release ( Biogenesis of EVs and their interaction with target cells. EV biogenesis and secretion: Exosomes are assembled in multivesicular bodies (MVB), where specific cargo is sorted into exosomes and subsequently released into the extracellular space. Microvesicles are formed by budding from the cell membrane. Apoptotic bodies are produced by apoptotic cells. EVs are taken up by recipient cells: EVs fully fuse with the recipient cell membrane, releasing their contents directly into the cytoplasm of the target cell. After internalization by the target cell, they reach multivesicular endosomes (MVE) and are further degraded and recycled through lysosomes. EVs bind to signaling receptors on target cells to regulate signal transduction. The production of MSC-EVs involves several steps: first, cells are extracted from different sources. Next, these cells undergo culture and expansion, followed by separation, purification, and storage ( MSC-EVs bioengineering applications.

In recent decades, their prevalence has continuously increased in many regions of the world[ Delayed diagnosis postpones early treatment, promoting the emergence of adverse effects with a severe impact on disease progression and the development of complications that can lead to irreversible damage, thereby increasing the need for surgical interventions[ Prevention strategies focus on the implementation of awareness campaigns aimed at achieving early diagnosis using non-invasive and cost-effective tools. The use of a questionnaire to obtain a predictive score based on clinical symptomatology and the evaluation of fecal calprotectin has recently been proposed as a simple and affordable approach for early diagnosis of IBD[ \n Identifying the factors involved in increasing the time to diagnosis is crucial for defining priority areas for intervention. Studies conducted in Europe and Asia demonstrated that the time from initial symptom onset to seeking clinical help varied from 2 months to 8 years, with a longer duration observed in CD[ The absence of reliable and non-invasive biomarkers for preclinical screening of the general population represents another cause of late presentation. There is often a long period between asymptomatic onset and the first medical consultation, which is only sought due to worsening disease progression and the appearance of complications. This is considered the natural course of CD, which often begins with minimal, asymptomatic inflammation that progressively worsens, becomes symptomatic and recurrent, with an increased potential for the development of strictures. According to data reported by specialists, there are approximately 8-9 years between the onset of disease recurrence and the development of strictures, often necessitating surgical intervention[ Another study focused on asymptomatic IBD patients who were incidentally detected during colonoscopy screening for colorectal cancer and who developed rectal bleeding and diarrhea within a relatively reduced period [25 months; interquartile range (IQR) 10.5-42 months]. These symptoms confirmed the presence of intestinal mucosal lesions and suggest that the disease was already relatively advanced at the time of diagnosis[ This is consistent with the findings of the German study where patients frequently misinterpreted their symptoms, leading to increased waiting times before seeking medical consultations[ For UC, a study by Bl\u00fcthner  Enhancing the patient\u2019s understanding of the consequences of late detection of IBD and equipping them with self-monitoring tools is fundamental in promoting early diagnosis.

Normal bowel function is due to a variety of factors, such as morphologically intact gastrointestinal tract, the coordinated interplay between muscle contractions and neuronal impulses. Defecation is performed in the following ways: firstly, the contraction of colon can help mix the intraluminal contents, soak up water, and pushing contents to the rectum. The entry of feces into the rectum can cause reflexive relaxation of the internal anal sphincter (recto\u2010anal inhibitory reflex, RAIR). When RAIR occurs, fecal matter moves further into the anal canal, which arises the feeling of needing to defecate. At this moment, the brain sends out neural models that allow the active puborectalis muscles and external anal sphincter to relax, thus allowing for bowel movement. When bowel movements are not permitted, people need to control voluntarily. Fecal continence is defined as voluntary bowel motions with no soiling. Continence is achieved by three main factors: (1) voluntary muscle structures; (2) anorectal sensation; (3) rectosigmoid motility. The voluntary control of defecation is a physiological process. There are a lot of factors involved here: the strength of internal and external sphincter, the movement of pelvic floor muscles, reflex mechanisms, compliance regulation and rectal sensation, etc. Abnormalities in any one of them can lead to defecation dysfunction. It is well known that the normal peri\u2010anorectal muscle structure plays a decisive role in defecation control. In 1982, Pena Patients with ARMs especially the intermediate\u2010to high\u2010type malformation often show the dysplasia of perianal anorectal muscles, and the higher malformation, the more severe consequences. When these peri\u2010anorectal muscles, which are involved in the bowel movement, are poorly developed, peristalsis disorder occurs in the intestine, leading to fecal incontinence, constipation, and other dysfunctions, which seriously affects the prognosis of the patient. Most of these conclusions are reasonable conjectures based on pathophysiological theories. However, the mechanism of interaction between abnormal perianal muscle development and postoperative defecation dysfunction is not clear. There is a lack of objective standards for the growth of pelvic floor muscles in children at present. Therefore, a standardized and multicenter randomized controlled study needs to be validated.

An overview of the following four mentioned drugs can be found in  Lubiprostone, difluoropentyl-2-hydroxy-6-oxooctahydrocyclopenta-heptanoic acid, activates the chloride channels 2 (ClC-2) located on the gastrointestinal apical cell membrane. When these channels are activated, fluid secretion will be established and softens the feces, which supports transit through the gastrointestinal tract [ Large randomized controlled trials (n = 237 and n = 1171, respectively) evaluating the effect of lubiprostone in adults with FC and/or IBS-C reported promising results with significantly more spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) [ In the past five years, several studies have been performed to identify the efficacy and safety of lubiprostone in children with FC. A non-randomized open-label study evaluated the safety of lubiprostone in children fulfilling the Rome III criteria for FC at 6\u201317 years of age. Indeed, lubiprostone (12 mcg or 24 mcg orally) was found to be well tolerated and without significant adverse events (AEs) [ Linaclotide is a guanylate cyclase-C (GC-C) receptor agonist. Activating the GC-C receptor leads to more intestinal fluids, softens feces, and speeds up the transit of stool [ In recent years, several studies in adults with FC have shown that linaclotide is an effective laxative treatment [ A large study conducted in seven countries evaluated the difference in SBMs when using linaclotide (n = 166) compared to placebo (n = 164) in children, 6\u201317 years of age, fulfilling the Rome III criteria for FC [ Prucalopride is a selective, high-affinity 5-hydroxytryptamine-4 (5-HT-4) receptor agonist.

Congenital myenteric hypoganglionosis typically presents during the neonatal period and is thought to arise from inborn hypoplasia of the parasympathetic myenteric plexus [ Due to the clinical overlap with Hirschsprung\u2019s disease and other Hirschsprung-related disorders, a definitive diagnosis of myenteric hypoganglionosis requires multiple full-thickness biopsies or extensive pathological examination of resected bowel segments [ Treatment of myenteric hypoganglionosis often involves surgical resection of the affected bowel segments. The acquired subset of myenteric hypoganglionosis generally exhibits more favorable outcomes following surgical treatment when compared to congenital myenteric hypoganglionosis [ We present one of the few cases in the literature regarding myenteric hypoganglionosis. To our knowledge, this is the only case report that describes, in detail, the surgical complication of colonic perforation after initial diversion for myenteric hypoganglionosis. A 12-year-old male presented with chronic constipation who underwent unsuccessful colonoscopy, manual fecal disimpaction under anesthesia, and endoscopic decompression, ultimately requiring exploratory laparotomy with enterostomy creation, with further hospital course complicated by ascending colonic perforation and subsequent takeback to the operating room. Pathology of a resected segment of terminal ileum and colon was consistent with myenteric hypoganglionosis. The patient was a 12-year-old Caucasian male with a history of achalasia status post laparoscopic Heller myotomy with Dor fundoplication two years prior who presented as a transfer from an outside hospital for constipation and abdominal distention. The patient suffered from longstanding constipation at baseline, taking lansoprazole, MiraLAX, and Dulcolax, but usually had 1\u20132 bowel movements a week. At the time he was transferred to our institution, the patient had not had a bowel movement for 1 month. However, the patient had been passing flatus. A colonoscopy at the outside hospital was technically unsuccessful due to significant stool burden. The patient was born in the U.S. and lived in New York, with no recent travel outside the U.S. His family history was significant for a mother with multiple sclerosis and a paternal cousin with achalasia. The patient had no allergies and was up to date on vaccinations. He was born full-term without complications in the neonatal period, including normal meconium passage at birth.

In a review of 23 patients with caudal duplication syndrome, hindgut duplication always involved the anorectal region, and genital duplication was observed in all female cases. We present a unique case of ASM in a patient with Currarino syndrome with features of caudal duplication anomaly. The patient\u2019s Currarino syndrome was characterized by scimitar sacral anomaly and ASM, while the caudal duplication anomaly involved duplication of the hindgut, including the bowel, rectum, and anus, along with duplication of the lower urogenital tract, including the uterus, vagina, ureters, urethral opening, and external genitalia. This case not only adds to the existing literature on these rare conditions but also provides valuable insights for neurosurgeons managing these complex conditions. A 58-year-old woman with a history of previously undiagnosed Currarino syndrome with caudal duplication anomalies and a known large ASM was referred for neurosurgical intervention due to progressive mass effect causing hydronephrosis and worsening renal function of solitary left kidney. The patient was told she was born with a mild form of \u201cconjoined twinning\u201d characterized by a duplicated bowel (unknown proximal extent), rectum, anus, ureters, urethral opening, uterus, and vagina, along with an ASM. However, a precise diagnosis was not established at that time. Her right anus and rectum were removed shortly after birth, followed by multiple early childhood surgeries, including resection of duplicated bowel with end-to-end anastomosis and temporary colostomy. Since then, she has experienced bowel dysfunction, requiring regular diaper use. At age 9, she underwent a urinary diversion with ileal conduit due to recurrent urinary tract infections associated with a neurogenic bladder, followed by a simple cystectomy at age 18 for pyocystitis. She underwent a hysterectomy at 30 years for menorrhagia, during which extensive pelvic adhesions from prior surgeries were noted. At age 44, she was diagnosed with a right ureteropelvic junction obstruction and underwent a pyeloplasty, but her right-sided back pain persisted. She was subsequently referred for neurosurgical evaluation of the ASM. At her initial neurosurgical consultation 6 years prior, the patient\u2019s primary complaint was chronic low back pain that had persisted for more than 12 years, rated 2\u20133/10 on the visual analog scale but intermittently worsening to 7\u20138/10 with prolonged standing or sitting.

The ultrastructure of the gel was then examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Finally, we established a rat model of enterocutaneous fistula to evaluate the  A total of 10 healthy volunteers were recruited. For each volunteer, 30\u00a0mL of PRP was collected using a cell separator (Fresenius COM. TEC). The procedure was performed by physicians following standard operating protocols. Extracorporeal circulation was established through bilateral antecubital veins using 18-G intravenous catheters. Anticoagulation was maintained with ACD-A at a ratio of 1:7.5. The blood flow rate was approximately 40\u00a0mL/min, with a total circulating volume of 300\u2013500\u00a0mL. 25\u00a0mL PRP was used for the preparation of Cryo-PRP. The procedure for the preparation of Cryo-PRP was as follows: PRP was first frozen at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h. Post-thawing at 4\u00a0\u00b0C with precipitate formation, centrifugation (3,000\u00a0rpm \u00d7 10\u00a0min) was conducted under isothermal conditions. After centrifugation, four-fifths of the supernatant (PRP-S) was carefully removed, and the remaining one-fifth was resuspended to obtain Cryo-PRP. PRP, Cryo-PRP, or PRP-S were mixed with a bovine thrombin/calcium gluconate solution at a volume ratio of 10:1. After 30\u00a0s of mixing, the corresponding gel form was obtained. PRP, Cryo-PRP, and PRP-S gels were prepared as described and immediately fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h. After fixation, the samples were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and subsequently dehydrated through a graded ethanol series (30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, and 100%, 10\u00a0min each). The dehydrated samples were then dried using critical point drying, mounted on aluminum stubs, and sputter-coated with a thin layer of gold. Morphological observation was performed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM; Hitachi S-4800, Japan).

Exosomes consist of a phospholipid bilayer that carries bioactive molecules, such as proteins, lipids, mRNAs, and miRNAs [ In this review, we aimed to explore the therapeutic potential of stem cell-derived exosomes in the treatment of chronic skin wounds, offering a comprehensive overview of their mechanisms, benefits, and clinical translational prospects in regenerative medicine. While many previous studies have focused on exosomes derived from a single stem cell source, this review offers a broader analysis by encompassing a variety of stem cell types, including MSCs, adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), human umbilical cord MSCs (HucMSCs), and hair follicle mesenchymal stem cells (HF-MSCs). By systematically discussing the biological mechanisms, therapeutic efficacy, and clinical applicability of exosomes derived from each cell type, this review aims to present an integrated perspective on the distinct characteristics and potential of various stem cell-based exosome therapies. Therefore, it offers a more comprehensive and differentiated discussion compared to the existing literature. Wound healing is a complex, multiphase biological process involving hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling; this process is tightly regulated through cellular interactions, molecular signaling pathways, and extracellular matrix (ECM) dynamics ( Following vascular injury, circulating platelets rapidly adhere to the exposed subendothelial matrix, activating platelets and initiating a sequence of events that lead to clot formation and vascular sealing (via a platelet plug) [ During this phase, neutrophils infiltrate injured tissues to phagocytose pathogens and damaged tissue. Next, monocyte-derived macrophages initially adopt a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype and later transition into the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype to promote tissue repair [ This phase is characterized by re-epithelialization, angiogenesis, and fibroblast activation [ During the remodeling phase, myofibroblasts and excess endothelial cells undergo apoptosis, thereby reducing tissue cellularity [ Exosomes are extracellular nanovesicles ranging from 30 to 150 nm, derived from the endosomal pathway.

While studies have investigated the potential involvement of aerobic and anaerobic organisms, including  To date, there have been limited studies examining the gut microbiota and associated metabolites in the context of pediatric PA. In our investigation, we utilized 16S rRNA sequencing and LC-MS/MS-based metabolomics to explore these relationships, with the objective of gaining a deeper understanding of how gut microbiota and metabolites influence the onset and progression of PA and fistulas in children. This study holds significant importance for preventing the colonization of potential pathogenic bacteria in pediatric patients with PA, as well as for advancing clinical treatment strategies and prognostic evaluations. Participants newly diagnosed with PA from October to December 2022 were enrolled in this study. The inclusion criteria comprised a confirmed diagnosis of PA, an age range of 6 months to 3 years, consent to participate in the research, and comprehension of the study\u2019s objectives.

In particular, this technique uses the stoma site as the only incision, thus eliminating the need for an additional incision and reducing the incidence of incisional hernia [ Despite these advantages, the need for all instruments to pass through a single incision leads to crossed instruments and interference with the camera, thus limiting their range of motion which further results in difficult handling during the procedure. This hurdle demands a challenging learning curve, provokes controversies regarding the safety and feasibility of this approach, especially in patients with previous abdominal surgeries or complex underlying conditions [ Considering the current status of single-port laparoscopic stoma formation, this video presents our experience with this technique in a complicated situation and assesses its feasibility. The video shows a 61-year-old man who underwent a single-port\u2013assisted diverting loop ileostomy for anastomotic leakage following rectal cancer surgery. Laparoscopic low anterior resection with bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection and simultaneous resection of liver metastases was performed for advanced rectal cancer with liver and pelvic lateral lymph node metastases.

The electronic medical records of adult CD patients (aged 18\u2009years or older) with colorectal adenocarcinoma who were evaluated at Mayo Clinic Rochester, Florida, or Arizona and Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, between January 1, 1989, and August 31, 2022, were assessed. Mayo Data Explorer was utilized to identify potential Mayo Clinic patients. The diagnosis of CD was based on clinical, endoscopic, histopathologic, and/or radiologic criteria. The diagnosis of colorectal adenocarcinoma was confirmed through histopathology. Patients were excluded if they developed CD after establishing colorectal adenocarcinoma or were diagnosed with hereditary cancer syndrome. Data on the patient\u2019s basic demographics, cigarette smoking habits, PSC, IBD in the patient\u2019s family, and CRC in first-degree relatives were obtained. Clinical details of CD include the date of diagnosis, disease duration, location and behavior, the presence of perianal disease or fistula, CD medication usage, and surgical history, and endoscopic factors such as post-inflammatory polyps, strictures, scars, and dysplasia before CRC diagnosis were retrieved.
