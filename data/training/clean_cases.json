Case Discussion The description of this fistula is matching with a trans-sphincteric type that represents 25% of perianal fistula . The track of the fistula crosses from the intersphincteric space, through the external sphincter, and then passes into the ischiorectal fossa .

In fistulography, the external opening is catheterized with a fine cannula, and a water-soluble contrast agent is injected to determine the fistulous tract. Nowadays, MRI is the imaging modality of choice for evaluating the perianal fistula. When MRI is contraindicated, fistulography could be performed, although it is an unreliable technique and is difficult to interpret.

    "findings_text": "2. Case presentation A 27-year-old female was admitted to the Third People’s Hospital of Longgang District, Shenzhen, on January 16, 2024, with worsening buttock swelling, pain, and purulent discharge for 6 months, intensifying over the past 2 days. Initially experiencing anal pain 6 months prior, she self-medicated with an unspecified drug for 1 month without relief. Three months ago, the pain extended from the anus to the buttocks, leading to significant swelling and pus discharge, prompting hospital admission. She had not received any surgical treatment before admission. Her body mass index was 20 kg/m², and she reported a 2-year history of constipation and hard stools, with bowel movements twice weekly. There was no history of coronary heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, trauma, blood transfusions, or surgeries. She denied smoking, alcohol use, or harmful habits, and there was no family history of genetic diseases. Physical examination upon admission: Body temperature 36.4℃; pulse 105 beats per minute; respiration 20 breaths per minute; blood pressure 129/78 mm Hg. The patient was conscious, with a tired mental state, lack of strength and reluctance to speak, and a soft voice. No obvious abnormalities were found in the physical examination of the heart, lungs, and abdomen. Neither the liver nor the spleen was palpable under the costal margin. The hepatic dullness boundary was normal, there was no shifting dullness, and there was no tenderness on percussion of the renal area. Special examination findings: Extensive skin pigmentation, bridged scars, and multiple ulcer openings were observed in the perianal and perineal areas and both buttocks (the lesion area on the left thigh was larger than that on the right). The subcutaneous fistulas were fused and interconnected, and there were a total of 22 ulcer openings. Palpation of the lesions revealed an obvious fluctuating sensation and significant tenderness. When pressed, grayish-red purulent and bloody fluid flowed out from the ulcer openings. The pus was thick and foul-smelling. A cord-like structure extending towards the anus could be felt in the left buttock lesion. The infected area of the entire buttock accounted for approximately 3% of the body surface area. Digital rectal examination: A hard nodule and a cord-like structure leading to and connected with the left buttock lesion area could be felt at the rectal segment at the 3 o’clock position in the lithotomy position, about 5 cm from the anus. There was no tenderness in the anal sinus area at the 3 o’clock position. A cord-like structure could be felt at the 6 o’clock position leading to the anal sinus area at the 9 o’clock position and extending along the skin to the subcutaneous tissue of the right buttock at the 9 o’clock position as shown in Figure 1 A and B.

    "title": "Anal sphincter reconstruction for fecal incontinence: Techniques, outcomes, and future directions",
    "clinical_history": "",
    "findings_text": "\n Fecal incontinence (FI) is a debilitating disorder that significantly affects both physical function and psychological well-being, with a global prevalence of 2%-21% among adults[ In this article, we conducted a comprehensive minireview on the epidemiology, pathophysiological mechanisms, diagnosis, and therapeutic advancements in FI, with a focus on the application and progress of anal sphincter reconstruction. We summarize the efficacy and limitations of traditional surgical approaches and consolidate research progress on emerging treatment options. Through this systematic and integrated strategy, we aim to provide more precise and effective solutions for FI management. FI is clinically defined as the involuntary loss of bowel control, including uncontrolled passage of solid/Liquid stool or flatus[ FI generally arises from the combined influence of multiple pathogenic elements as opposed to a single etiological factor. These factors jointly compromise the structural integrity and functional capacity of the anal sphincter complex. Among women, obstetric trauma represents the predominant etiological factor, with vaginal delivery posing a particular risk. Forceps-assisted deliveries, for example, double the risk of sphincter dysfunction compared with spontaneous vaginal birth due to excessive mechanical stress on the perineal muscles[ In addition to obstetric causes, surgical interventions in the pelvic region, particularly for colorectal, gynecologic, or urologic procedures, may inadvertently cause iatrogenic injury to the anal sphincter. In many cases, these injuries might not be recognized intraoperatively, leading to suboptimal repair and subsequent clinical deterioration[ Local infections, ionizing radiation exposure, and age-associated degenerative alterations independently contribute to progressive sphincter damage. Pelvic infections localized to perineal tissues may trigger gradual inflammatory responses, leading to abscess development and subsequent myonecrosis, with eventual tissue loss or fibrotic scar formation[ The anatomical basis of continence involves precisely coordinated actions of several key structures: The internal anal sphincters (IAS) and external anal sphincters (EAS), the puborectalis muscle, and the intact pelvic floor musculature[ Accurate diagnosis and quantification of anal sphincter injury are critical for devising an effective management plan for patients suffering from FI. Endoanal ultrasound (EAUS) has emerged as the gold standard for the detailed evaluation of anal sphincter integrity[ Comprehensive clinical evaluation forms the cornerstone of diagnostic assessment for FI. Initial patient assessment requires detailed historical analysis to elucidate potential causative factors, encompassing previous obstetric trauma, surgical interventions, and episodes of infection or radiation exposure potentially affecting sphincter integrity.

    "clinical_history": "",
    "findings_text": "A 20-year-old woman presented to the general surgery department with complaints of cyclical blood-stained discharge from the perianal region occurring consistently during menstruation for the past 4 years. She also reported severe dysmenorrhea and chronic pelvic pain that had persisted since menarche at age 15. Her menstrual cycles were regular, but intensely painful, and associated with increased perianal bleeding and discomfort. The patient had previously undergone multiple imaging investigations, including ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT), which revealed left renal agenesis and a thick-walled tubular structure in the left adnexa. A provisional diagnosis of a megaureter with ectopic, dysplastic or absent left kidney was made at that time. Four years earlier, she underwent laparoscopic pelvic surgery at a different hospital, but no medical records or operative notes were available. Notably, her perianal symptoms began approximately 2–3 months postsurgery and were managed empirically by local practitioners, with no documented work-up or resolution. Initial pelvic ultrasound at our institution demonstrated a tubular, thick-walled cystic lesion with internal echoes in the pelvis ( (A and B) Tubular thick walled cystic lesion in pelvis showing mobile internal echoes. (A) Left kidney not visualised in left renal fossa and (B) Normal sized uterus noted in pelvis. The patient returned during her subsequent menstrual cycle with complaints of severe dysmenorrhea and frank perianal bleeding. Repeat ultrasonography revealed a second tubular structure in the pelvis, morphologically resembling a uterus with internal fluid levels and echogenic contents suggestive of hematometra ( (A and B) The tubular cystic structure was identified as the second horn of a didelphic uterus. It contained fluid with mobile internal echoes suggestive of hematometra. To further delineate the anatomy, an MRI pelvis was performed. It revealed a thick-walled tubular structure in the pelvis containing T1 hyperintense and T2 hypointense contents, consistent with blood products ( (A) T2 image showing Uterine didelphys (white arrow) with left hematometra.

    "findings_text": "In May 2025, a 66-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital with an anal fistula. His medical history included hypertension and diabetes mellitus. In 2020, he had undergone small bowel resection for –lymphoma. Over a decade earlier, he had anal fistula surgery at an external hospital, where postoperative pathology revealed no abnormalities, and the wound healed well. In 2023, he presented with perianal swelling and pain and was diagnosed with an anal fistula. In 2024, he underwent another surgical procedure at the same hospital; the postoperative wound healed well, and pathology revealed no specific changes. One month prior, the patient developed a mass at the original surgical site, accompanied by pain, discomfort, and minimal fluid discharge. Bowel movements occurred every other day, one to two times each day, with occasional bright red hematochezia. On physical examination, the anal region appeared uneven, with an old surgical scar visible at the 3 o’clock position in the lithotomy position. A firm, irregularly surfaced mass measuring approximately 1 × 1 cm was located 2 cm from the anal margin at the 3 o’clock position, with local redness, swelling, and minimal discharge. Digital rectal examination revealed a mass at the same position, with slight blood staining on the glove upon withdrawal. No other abnormalities were detected. The admission diagnosis was suspected to be an anal fistula. Laboratory tests revealed a carcinoembryonic antigen level of 9.19 ng/mL and a cytokeratin (CK) 19 fragment level of 5.36 ng/mL. Infectious disease screening excluded HIV infection. Two-dimensional endorectal ultrasound showed a subcutaneous hypoechoic area at the 3 o’clock position in lithotomy, extending through the sphincter and submucosa to the anorectal ring from the 3 to 5 o’clock positions, with local blood flow signals—findings consistent with a high complex anal fistula. Pathological examination was recommended to rule out malignancy. To further clarify the diagnosis, colonoscopy was performed. A sessile polyp approximately 0.8 × 0.8 cm in size with a smooth surface was found in the transverse colon near the hepatic flexure. Additionally, a mucosal ulcer was observed in the transverse colon 70 cm from the anus, and a biopsy was taken. In the sigmoid colon, 18 cm from the anus, a pedunculated polyp measuring approximately 1.2×1.0 cm with a smooth, congested, and lobulated surface was identified. No other abnormalities were detected. The colonoscopy findings and clinical presentation excluded Crohn’s disease. Post-colonoscopy pathology revealed a tubular adenoma in the transverse colon, with areas of low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia in the glandular epithelium. Pelvic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed perianal and gluteal soft tissue swelling. An internal opening was observed at the 3–7 o’clock position of the anal canal at the dentate line level, extending superiorly through the sphincter to the inferior levator ",

The patient had a history of hypertension and intermittently took medication for treatment. He had previously undergone a subtotal gastrectomy due to a gastric ulcer. Three months ago, the patient developed perianal swelling and pain after consuming spicy food. A palpable mass was noted, but there was no significant pain. After applying ointment externally, the mass subsided. Two weeks ago, following another episode of consuming spicy food, the patient experienced perianal discharge, accompanied by yellowish-white secretion, with significant swelling and pain. The patient subsequently sought medical attention at the hospital. Upon conducting an anal examination, the doctor found a 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm fistula opening approximately 3 cm from the anal margin at the 4 o’clock and 7 o’clock positions. A cord-like structure could be palpated at the 3 o’clock position along the fistula tract, with notable tenderness on palpation.

After failed outpatient management, bedside surgical drainage was performed. Despite initial improvement, the patient evolved into a complex anal fistula. Colorectal surgery evaluation confirmed a posterior transsphincteric fistula of cryptoglandular origin. In August 2022, he underwent fistulectomy, internal opening closure, and cryptectomy. However, recurrence was documented during follow-up, with a new external opening in the posterior right gluteal region, approximately 9 cm from the anal verge. In July 2023, a second surgical intervention included fistulectomy, cryptectomy, sphincterotomy, and sphincteroplasty of both the internal and external anal sphincters. Postoperatively, the patient developed severe fecal incontinence due to midline posterior disruption of both sphincters, in addition to fistula recurrence.

The average age at diagnosis was 35.90 years, ranging from 15 to 70 years, reflecting the bimodal distribution typically observed in IBD onset (15–30 years and over 60 years). The mean disease duration was 5.98 years, with the modal disease duration being two years. Most patients (n = 49, 84.5%) resided in urban areas, and 25 patients (43.1%) had completed higher education. Analysis of smoking status indicated that most patients were non-smokers (n = 31, 53.4%) or had quit smoking over one year prior (n = 17, 29.3%). The mean body mass index (BMI) was 23.78 kg/m Regarding disease types, of the 58 enrolled patients, 33 (56.9%) had CD, 24 (41.4%) had UC, and 1 patient was initially diagnosed with IC, but for statistical reasons, we included that patient in UC group. In CD patients, ileocolonic localization was the most frequent, observed in 21 patients (36.2%). The predominant phenotypes of CD included inflammatory (13 patients, 22.4%), stricturing (10 patients, 17.2%), penetrating (7 patients, 12.1%) forms and 3 patients presented overlapping forms. Specifically, 1 patient (1.72%) had both stricturing and perianal disease and 2 (3.45%) patients exhibited penetrating and perianal phenotypes. Among UC patients, most had pancolonic involvement (13 patients, 22.4%), followed by left-sided colitis (9 patients, 15.5%) and proctitis (3 patients, 5.2%). Treatment analysis showed that the majority of patients (n = 26, 44.82%) received biological therapies (Ustekinumab and Vedolizumab), 39.65% of patients received anti-TNF therapy, 19% were treated with aminosalicylates, 10% with corticosteroids, and only 2% with immunosuppressants. Surgical resection of gastrointestinal tract segments was performed in 10 out of the 58 patients (17.2%). To identify risk factors potentially influencing MASLD development among patients diagnosed with IBD, statistical associations between IBD type, HBI, Mayo Score, CRP levels, fecal calprotectin, and the presence of hepatic steatosis/fibrosis were examined.

    "title": "Endoanal Ultrasound in Perianal Crohn’s Disease",
    "clinical_history": "",
    "findings_text": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely regarded as the reference standard for perianal Crohn’s disease, owing to its multiplanar capabilities, excellent soft tissue contrast, and ability to assess the entire pelvic floor, including supralevator and extrapelvic extensions [ By contrast, endoanal ultrasound (EAUS) offers a readily available, low-cost, and radiation-free alternative that can be performed at the bedside, intraoperatively for seton management, or in outpatient clinics. Modern three-dimensional probes offer high-resolution imaging of the anal sphincter complex and intersphincteric space, allowing for the precise identification of internal openings, delineation of primary and secondary tracts, and detection of associated abscesses. EAUS is particularly useful for classifying fistulas in relation to the sphincters and for guiding intraoperative seton placement [ However, EAUS has intrinsic limitations: very lateral or supralevator tracts and complex secondary extensions are often beyond the field of view, and anal stenosis or severe pain may preclude probe insertion. Buchanan et al. reported that MRI-guided surgical planning was associated with a 75% reduction in postoperative recurrence compared with surgery without MRI guidance [ Comparative studies report variable results. Schwartz et al. Schwartz et al. found EAUS and examination under anesthesia (EUA) to be more accurate than MRI in some cases, with >90% concordance to surgical findings [ Orsoni et al. similarly showed EAUS to be the most sensitive modality among 22 patients with perianal Crohn’s disease [ From a practical perspective, EAUS offers unique organizational advantages: it can be used as a first-line tool for rapid triage, repeated at short intervals to monitor therapeutic response, and used intraoperatively for peri-seton management. MRI, on the other hand, remains indispensable for assessing supralevator disease, deep pelvic sepsis, and fibrosis, and is the only modality with validated scoring indices for clinical trials. Rather than competing, the two techniques are complementary. EAUS ensures bedside accessibility and dynamic follow-up, while MRI provides comprehensive mapping and standardized endpoints. Optimal management, therefore, often requires a tailored approach, and in selected cases, the integration of both modalities ensures the most accurate assessment and guidance for therapy in perianal Crohn’s disease.

Although she did not take any more laxatives thereafter, she started to have severe diarrhea that continued until she presented to our ED 14 days later. The diarrhea occurred more than 10 times per day, was watery and sometimes had bloody streaks but no mucous contents. This was associated with generalized severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting 2 times, as well as low oral intake and fever. She was feeling lethargic and had a headache, but had no visual or other neurological symptoms. She denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitation, cough, flu symptoms, or sore throat. She did not have joint or skin concerns. She denied any oral ulceration, perianal pain, or ulcers. This was the first such episode in her life. Results of the other systematic exams were unremarkable. Her family history was unremarkable for any gastrointestinal inflammatory, malignant disease, genetic or rheumatological diseases, and nobody else in the family had the same symptoms at that same time. She denied unusual food intake, travel, sick contact, or animal contacts. On examination, she looked very tired and lethargic, with significant dehydration. She was thin, with body weight 50 kg, her temperature was 38.4°C, heart rate 140 beat/min, and blood pressure 122/73, and she was maintaining 100% saturation on room air, with tachypnea of 23 to 30 breath/min. An abdominal examination revealed significant tenderness all over, but no rebound, organomegaly, or palpable mass. Bowel sounds were active and the abdomen was soft and not distended. There were no oral ulcers, eye changes, or any skin or joints changes. Chest examination was normal with normal breath sounds and cardiovascular examination was normal with normal S1, S2, and no murmurs.

    "findings_text": "A 39-year-old man with a 15-year history of diagnosed CD presented with a 3-month history of progressively worsening chronic pain and swelling of the right lower extremity. Fifteen years ago, the patient underwent right hemicolectomy with primary anastomosis due to colonic perforation. Thereafter, the diagnosis of CD was made based on histopathological findings. Infliximab therapy was initiated (5 mg/kg IV at weeks 0, 2, and 6, followed by every 8 weeks). Eight years later, the patient developed a complex perianal fistula, marking the beginning of a prolonged course of perianal CD. Since then, the patient underwent surgical interventions on nine occasions due to recurrent CD-related complications. Because of inadequate disease control, a loop colostomy was performed approximately 18 months prior to admission. The patient was a heavy smoker with several unsuccessful attempts to quit. Upon admission, the patient reported low back pain and intermittent drainage from a perianal fistula. Notably, two months prior to admission, the patient experienced similar painful symptoms, which at that time were attributed to an interpolar right renal calculus, confirmed by ultrasonography in the local city hospital. Upon hospital admission, the patient presented with the following signs: heart rate of 110 beats per minute, without abnormal lung sounds, oxygen saturation of 97%, and was afebrile. Physical examination revealed mild tenderness to palpation, erythema, edema, and increased warmth of the right lower extremity. The patient was underweight, with a body mass index (BMI) of 16.5 kg/m². Laboratory analyses showed a positive inflammatory syndrome, characterized by elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, absolute neutrophil count, platelets, C-reactive protein (CRP), and fibrinogen, along with stable anemia of chronic disease (Table  L – liter; mg/L – milligrams per liter; g/L – grams per liter; g/dL – grams per deciliter Colour Doppler ultrasound revealed evidence of venous thrombosis in the right inguinal region, and therapy with fraxiparine (0.6 mL SC twice daily) was initiated. Colonoscopy was unremarkable. On the second day of hospitalization, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis was performed to evaluate a potential intra-abdominal or pelvic source of infection. The scan revealed extensive subfascial and interfascial fluid collections, along with thickening and hyperintense signal of the muscle fascia on T2-weighted images, consistent with fascial inflammation. These findings, particularly the deep intramuscular fascial involvement and edema, are characteristic of NF, even in the absence of gas formation or hypoenhancement due to necrosis (Figure  Note the asymmetry between the left and right thighs, with diffuse tissue swelling in the affected limb.

The procedure was successful in 39 patients (30%), while the remaining 90 patients experienced persistent fistulas. These recurrences were classified as intersphincteric in 41 patients (32%) and transsphincteric in 49 patients (38%). Among patients with transsphincteric recurrence, various salvage treatments were applied following shared decision‐making between the surgical team and the patient, based on clinical characteristics, preferences and surgical feasibility. Thirteen of these patients underwent TAFR, while 28 patients received alternative treatments (e.g. laser ablation of the fistula tract (LAFT), redo‐ligation of the intersphincteric fistula tract (re‐LIFT), ligation of the intersphincteric fistula tract using a Permacol mesh (Bio‐LIFT), fistula plug, Permacol paste injection, fistulotomy or seton placement) and 8 patients were lost to follow‐up. In addition, 11 patients with MRI‐confirmed full‐blown transsphincteric recurrences were referred from other centres for salvage TAFR. Together with the 13 patients treated at our own centre, a total of 24 patients underwent salvage TAFR and were included in this analysis. Seventeen of these 24 (71%) TAFR procedures were successful.

    "clinical_history": "",
    "findings_text": "Demographic and clinical characteristics This prospective randomized controlled trial enrolled 100 patients with fistula-in-ano, equally allocated into two groups: laser surgery (n = 50, 50%) and open surgery (n = 50, 50%), using an even-odd randomization method at enrollment. The mean age of participants was 42.5 ± 10.2 years. Most patients were aged 35-50 years (n = 55, 55%), followed by 51-65 years (n = 25, 25%) and 18-34 years (n = 20, 20%). A male predominance was observed with 78 males (n = 78, 78%) and 22 females (n = 22, 22%), consistent with global epidemiological trends. Occupationally, 40 patients (n = 40, 40%) were manual laborers, 35 (n = 35, 35%) were office workers, and 25 (n = 25, 25%) were unemployed or engaged in domestic duties. Socioeconomic assessment revealed that individuals from lower-income backgrounds often experienced delayed access to care. A majority (n = 60, 60%) resided in rural areas, while 40 (n = 40, 40%) lived in urban settings, suggesting geographical disparities in healthcare access.

External opening positions refer to the anatomical clock face in the lithotomy position (6 o’clock = posterior midline; 12 o’clock = anterior midline). ENDO-LASER: Endoscopic radial-emitting 1470 nm diode laser procedure; LIFT: Ligation of the intersphincteric fistula tract. “Not Applicable” is used where a procedure was not performed in the respective group. Symptom duration varied, with 45 patients (n = 45, 45%) symptomatic for 6-12 months, 35 (n = 35, 35%) for less than six months, and 20 (n = 20, 20%) for more than a year, indicating chronic disease in many cases. MRI and clinical evaluation identified 55 intersphincteric (n = 55, 55%) and 45 transsphincteric (n = 45, 45%) fistulas. The most common external opening was at the 6 o’clock position (n = 50, 50%), followed by 3 o’clock and 9 o’clock (n = 30, 30%) and 12 o’clock (n = 20, 20%). Most patients (n = 80, 80%) had single-tract fistulas, while 20 (n = 20, 20%) had multiple tracts, including 15 with secondary extensions (n = 15, 15%) and 10 with associated abscess cavities (n = 10, 10%), adding to the complexity of management. All patients underwent either endoscopic radial-emitting diode laser ablation or open surgery, which included fistulectomy (n = 30, 30%), fistulotomy (n = 10, 10%), and the LIFT procedure (n = 10, 10%). The mean operative time was significantly lower in the laser group (40 ± 10 minutes) compared to the open surgery group (60 ± 15 minutes), highlighting the procedural efficiency of the laser technique (p < 0.05). Primary endpoints Table  VAS: Visual analog scale Postoperative pain Postoperative pain significantly affects both the recovery trajectory and overall patient satisfaction.

    "title": "Is Primary Opening of Fistula-in-Ano Always at Dentate Line: Correlation Between MRI and Operative Findings in 379 Patients",
    "clinical_history": "",
    "findings_text": "On MRI, the primary opening was categorized to be at three levels - at the dentate line, above the dentate line, and below the dentate line. The length of the surgical anal canal [distance between the anal verge and the anorectal sling (lower border of the levator ani muscle)] was calculated on MRI by the method described below. The primary internal opening was categorized on MRI as When the primary internal opening was located >33% of the total length of the surgical anal canal from the anal verge (upper 2/3 of the surgical anal canal) When the primary internal opening was located <25% of the total length of the surgical anal canal from the anal verge (below the lower 1/4 of the surgical anal canal) When the primary internal opening was located between 25 to 33% of the total length of the surgical anal canal from the anal verge (between lower 1/4 and upper 2/3 of the surgical anal canal) There is no paper or study in the literature which attempted to find the level of the internal opening and correlate it with the dentate line. So, based on our experience and a pilot study, we defined the level of the dentate line on the MRI. The dentate line is an anatomical landmark present on rectal mucosa. It can be seen intraoperatively on visual inspection but is not visible on MRI. So, before initiating the study, we analysed a cohort of 50 patients of anal fistula who were never operated before for the fistula and in whom the internal opening was present at the dentate line (these patients were not included in the study). Then, in these patients, we correlated the level of the internal opening with relation to the boundaries/ landmarks of the surgical anal canal on the MRI scan. This demonstrated that the level of the internal opening (hence the dentate line) was present between 25 to 33% of the total length of the surgical anal canal from the anal verge (between lower 1/4 and upper 2/3 of the surgical anal canal). This led to further deduction of the level of the internal opening above or below the dentate line as mentioned above. This categorization of the primary internal opening in relation to the dentate line was apart from the location of the primary opening, the amount of external anal sphincter (EAS) by the fistula was also noted and tabulated. This parameter, “height of penetration of external sphincter (HOPE)”, is considered important to classify fistulas. The approval was taken from the Ethics Committee of Indus International Hospital via reference No EC/IIH-IEC/SP6. The patients were informed about the purpose of the study, written informed consent was obtained, and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The two important landmarks to be identified on an MRI are the ‘anorectal sling’ and the ‘anal verge’ as the distance between these two is the length of the ‘surgical anal canal’. The anorectal sling is identified on MRI as the lower border of the levator ani muscle (horizontal yellow arrow in Panel-A,  Normal",

    "findings_text": "Between March 15, 2019, and March 15, 2021, there were 7,107 visits to the emergency unit of the proctology department. Of these, 813 patients presented with perianal sepsis. However, 537 did not meet the inclusion criteria ( During an emergency proctology visit, incisional drainage under local anesthesia was performed on 155 patients (56.2%), with or without concurrent antibiotic therapy. Before their emergency visit, 68 patients (24.6%) had been treated with antibiotics for a median duration of 6 days (IQR, 2.5–6.5 days). The management of oral antibiotic therapy varied, with 49 cases where it was stopped, 19 where it continued, and 56 where it was newly prescribed. Consequently, a total of 124 patients (44.9%) received antibiotics, of whom 102 (82.3%) were treated for at least 3 days. The primary antibiotics administered were amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in 56.5% of cases, metronidazole in 21.0%, and pristinamycin in 17.7%. Subsequently, 178 patients (64.5%) underwent surgery within an average of 21.0 days (IQR, 10.0–46.5 days) following their emergency visit, with fistulas identified in 169 patients (94.9%). At the 1-year mark, 44 patients (17.8%) had no recorded follow-up, including 37 (13.4%) who had no further follow-up after their initial emergency visit and were therefore presumed not to have a fistula. At the 1-year follow-up, fistulas were detected in 181 of 276 patients (65.6%) through EAUS, MRI, and/or intraoperative physical examination. Of these cases, surgical drainage was performed in 169 (93.4%). Notably, 12 patients either declined surgery or were lost to follow-up despite having a scheduled operation. Univariate analysis indicated that patients who had received prior antibiotic therapy were less likely to have a surgical indication established during their first emergency visit compared to patients not receiving prior antibiotic therapy (50.0% vs. 63.8%, P=0.027). Similarly, at EAUS, fistulas were found less frequently in patients who had received prior antibiotic therapy (43.8% vs. 74.0%, P=0.010). The 1-year fistula rate was significantly lower in patients who had received antibiotics, regardless of whether a local incision had been made ( Propensity analysis, employing either 1:1 matching or inverse probability of treatment weighting, corroborated these findings: antibiotics significantly reduced the incidence of fistulas at 1 year ( ",

    "findings_text": "MRI images are acquired in 3 orthogonal planes: axial (transverse), coronal, and sagittal. However, most MRI analysis applications also provide biplanar (2 sections) or multiplanar (3 sections) viewing modes ( This capability can also be used to identify the coronal slice at the exact midpoint of the anal canal. In biplanar mode, with both coronal and axial views displayed, clicking on the coronal section will project its position as a horizontal line on the axial view. Then, the coronal section can be slid anteriorly or posteriorly until that horizontal line bisects the anal canal into anterior and posterior halves ( On MRI, 2 key landmarks must be identified: the anorectal sling and the anal verge. The distance between these points defines the length of the surgical anal canal [ The anorectal sling appears on MRI as the inferior border of the levator ani muscle ( After identifying the anorectal sling and the anal verge, the distance between these landmarks on MRI can be measured using the scale tool in RadiAnt DICOM Viewer (Medixant) ( In biplanar mode, an axial section should be displayed on one side ( The intersection of the horizontal yellow line (marking the level of the internal opening) and the vertical red axis of the surgical anal canal precisely locates the primary internal opening in relation to the surgical anal canal. The distance from the intersection to the anal verge (the lower red horizontal line) represents the height of the opening above the verge. Dividing this value by the total length of the surgical anal canal (the red vertical line) yields the relative position of the primary opening within the canal ( Once the opening’s position has been determined, it can be reported either in relation to the length of the surgical anal canal or relative to the dentate line. To express its relation to the dentate line, the following method is employed. The dentate line is an anatomical landmark on the mucosal surface. Although visible intraoperatively, it cannot be seen on MRI. Anatomically, it lies approximately 25% to 33% up the surgical anal canal—that is, at the junction of the lower one-third and upper two-thirds [ If the measurement falls between 25% and 33% of the surgical anal canal length, the primary internal opening is considered to be at the level of the dentate line. If it is less than 25%, the primary opening lies below the dentate line. If it is greater than 33%, the primary opening lies above the dentate line. The sphincter is shorter in the anterior direction, especially in women. Therefore, in addition to the above calculation, the sagittal view is also helpful for determining the height of the internal opening and the point at which the fistula tract penetrates the external sphincter. Similarly, in patients with previous surgery, resultant fibrosis should be considered when calculating the opening’s height.

    "findings_text": "A 36-year-old male patient presented with persistent discharge, pruritus, and pain. The patient had experienced multiple episodes of recurrent perianal abscesses, which were managed with incision and drainage. Over the past year, he developed continuous purulent discharge from a newly formed external opening in the right gluteal region, lateral to the ischial tuberosity. His symptoms progressively worsened, leading to a marked decline in quality of life. MRI revealed a complex fistula with more than three secondary tracts, the longest of which extended approximately 20 cm and opened into the right gluteal region. The primary tract was located at the 7-8 o’clock position in relation to the rectum. VAAFT was undertaken with the primary aim of accurately localizing the internal opening and comprehensively mapping the fistulous tract architecture. The procedure was conducted under general anesthesia with the patient positioned in the prone jackknife posture to optimize perineal access. Following standard antiseptic preparation, the fistuloscope was carefully introduced through the external opening, allowing real-time endoluminal visualization of the primary tract and any secondary extensions. Continuous irrigation facilitated clear visualization of the epithelialized tract; the internal opening was clearly identified and confirmed by both visual inspection and concurrent transillumination. Thorough curettage and unroofing of the secondary tracts were performed to disrupt the fistulous epithelium and promote healing. A loose draining seton was inserted to maintain adequate drainage and prevent premature closure, thereby minimizing the risk of abscess formation or recurrence. Importantly, the procedure ensured complete preservation of the sphincter mechanism. All surgical steps are demonstrated in Video  At the four-month follow-up, all secondary tracts had successfully closed. However, due to the development of false tracts from prior surgical attempts, the primary tract had progressed to a suprasphincteric course. Consequently, only the main fistulous tract remains, and the patient continues to be followed with a draining seton in place. ",

He denied recent trauma and heavy lifting. His past medical history included chronic sciatica.  Three weeks before presentation, the patient was seen by his general practitioner (GP) for new-onset pain radiating from the right hip down to the foot. At that time, he denied back pain, nocturnal pain, urinary or faecal incontinence, and altered perianal sensation. He remained fully mobile. On clinical examination, he appeared well, with normal gait and balance, and was found to have mild lumbar spinal tenderness on palpation. Neurological examination revealed normal lower limb muscle strength across all major muscle groups, including hip flexors/extensors, knee flexors/extensors, ankle dorsiflexors/plantar flexors, and toe movements. Sensory assessment demonstrated reduced sharp sensation over the right lateral foot. Deep tendon reflexes were preserved, and plantar reflexes were downgoing bilaterally, indicating normal upper motor neuron function. A clinical diagnosis of right-sided sciatica was made by the GP. The patient was started on amitriptyline, advised to continue nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and referred for a lumbar spine X-ray. He was educated about red flag symptoms and asked to urgently come to the ED if symptoms worsen.  Upon arrival at the hospital, vital signs revealed a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 15/15, temperature of 37.1℃, heart rate of 87 beats/minute, blood pressure of 104/64 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SpO₂) of 98% on room air. Routine blood tests showed no abnormalities of clinical concern. Neurological examination revealed no spinal tenderness, with intact sensation and motor function in all limbs. Digital rectal examination showed normal anal sphincter tone, no saddle anaesthesia, and no perianal numbness. Observations were within normal limits, and the bladder scan showed no urinary retention. He was treated with 100 mg rectal Diclofenac in the ED, which relieved the pain. A working diagnosis of lower back pain with right-sided sciatica was made, and he was discharged with analgesics, lansoprazole for gastric protection, and was instructed to return urgently if he developed leg weakness, urinary or faecal incontinence, and altered perianal sensation.  The patient re-presented to the ED the next morning with worsening severe lower back pain (pain score 10/10), predominantly in the right lower back. The pain intensified with weight bearing and was relieved by lying flat, significantly limiting mobility. He denied urinary incontinence, limb weakness, saddle anaesthesia, fever, recent trauma, or heavy lifting. On examination, he appeared pale and clinically unwell. His vitals were within normal range on arrival. Neurological examination was unremarkable. Musculoskeletal ass",

    "findings_text": "A 62-year-old male presented to a regional hospital with a painful, erythematous and indurated left buttock. The patient was found to be tachycardic and febrile, with raised inflammatory markers. He was transferred to a regional tertiary surgical centre where he underwent emergent incision and drainage of a suspected perianal abscess. No imaging was performed. The patient was discharged the following day with oral antibiotics. His past medical history included polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) (taking prednisone 25 mg/day), type two diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obesity, ischaemic heart disease, and congestive cardiac failure. He had sacroiliac joint (SIJ) screws in situ following a quadbike injury. He had no personal or family history of colorectal cancer or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). On postoperative Day 3 he had a resurgence of his pain prompting readmission and an examination under anaesthesia. This found a more extensive ischioanal abscess with anterior and posterior communication forming a circumferential horseshoe abscess. A modified Hanley’s procedure was performed with bilateral posterior incisions for drainage and insertion of penrose drains. Despite repeat surgical debridement the patient failed to improve. He was managed in the intensive care unit due to septic shock and required a short period of vasopressor support. Pelvic computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a contiguous abscess extending from the surgical cavity through the greater sciatic notch and into the left gluteal region ( CT pelvis (axial slices) demonstrating the perianal surgical site with packing, and the gas and fluid containing intergluteal collection.

The study included 69 patients, of whom 59 were males and 10 were females. A total of 80 perianal fistulae were detected in these 69 patients. Out of these patients, 9 (13.00%) had more than one fistula. According to the St. James’s University Hospital classification, most of the perianal fistulas were Grade 1 (42.5%), followed by Grades 2 and 4 (both 21.3%), then Grade 3 (11.3%), and the least common being Grade V (3.8%) fistula and abscess (Tables  Conventional MR imaging parameters Based on active clinical pus discharge, 54 (67.5%) of the fistulas were active, and 26 (32.5%) were inactive. For the detection of these tracts, almost perfect agreement was found between active pus discharge and DWI (P < 0.001), active pus discharge and T2 STIR (P < 0.001), and active pus discharge and post-contrast fat-suppressed T1 WI (P = 0.039).

Of the 80 primary fistulas, the internal opening could be noted in only 70 (87.5%) cases by post-contrast fat-suppressed T1-WI. For the detection of the internal opening, almost perfect agreement was found between the combination of DWI and T2 STIR and post-contrast fat-suppressed T1 WI (P < 0.001), substantial agreement was found between T2 STIR and post-contrast fat-suppressed T1 WI (P < 0.001), and only slight agreement was found between DWI and post-contrast fat-suppressed T1 WI (P= 0.011). In comparison to post-contrast fat-suppressed T1 WI, the ability to correctly identify the internal opening was maximum for the combined DWI and T2 STIR, followed by T2 STIR alone, and minimum for DWI alone.

Most abscesses (93.3%, 443 of 475) were surgically drained to the skin. However, 6.5% (31 of 475) were drained endoluminally. Of these, 13 were classified as high intersphincteric, 10 as intersphincteric horseshoe and two supralevator. Only one classified as perianal and two as low intersphincteric were described as drained endoluminally according to electronic patient records.

    "findings_text": "A 73-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension presented to the hospital with a six-year history of a painful, bloody left gluteal perirectal mass. It had increased in size in the past four to six months, during which time he had also noted fluctuating weight with a recent unexplained weight loss of 6 kg. He denied any fatigue, constipation, bloody stools, or melena. The patient also stated that he had never had a colonoscopy and had no family history of cancer. Reportedly, the mass had been biopsied previously in Mexico with benign results. The patient was hypothermic, with a temperature of 35.0 degrees Celsius, bradycardic (53 beats/min), and hypertensive (181/81 mmHg). On physical examination, a large exophytic mass extending from the perirectal region to the left gluteus was noted. The mass was large, ulcerated, and fungating and was approximately 15 cm in greatest diameter (Figure  On digital rectal exam, the anal canal was patent and the mucosa smooth; however, despite feeling the mass, we could not ascertain if it was originating from the anal canal or the lower rectum. The rest of the physical exam was within normal limits. Admission lab results showed a normal white blood cell count and low hemoglobin and hematocrit of 9.5 g/dL and 32.3%, respectively. Serum sodium and potassium levels were also within normal limits, in addition to creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and liver enzyme levels. Subsequent lab results did report a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 80 mm/hr and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) of 73.4 ng/mL. A pelvic MRI with and without contrast revealed a large T2 hyperintense, locally invasive, heterogeneous tumor measuring 15.7 x 10.5 x 8 cm. The mass was centered in the perianal soft tissue involving the left gluteal fold to the overlying skin. The tumor extended through the internal and external sphincters to the posterior wall of the anal canal, abutting the puborectalis and infiltrating the posterior wall of the anal canal and lateral walls of the lower rectum (Figure  Punch biopsy subsequently resulted as invasive, well-differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma without involvement of epidermis, most compatible with colorectal adenocarcinoma. CT of the chest/abdomen/pelvis showed no evidence of metastatic disease apart from the rectal mass. Due to the patient’s extensive progression of his tumor, it was difficult to clinically stage the patient’s PMA. The patient was discharged and advised to follow up outpatient for further workup. On outpatient follow-up, the patient underwent a colonoscopy, revealing no involvement of the anal canal.

The patient reported 5-6 bowel movements per day and denied substantial abdominal pain, fever, or chills. His medical history was significant for recurrent anal fistulas and benign prostatic hyperplasia with chronic outlet obstruction and associated urinary frequency. His surgical history included numerous examinations under anesthesia, endorectal advancement flaps, ligation of an intersphincteric fistula tract (LIFT) procedure, hemorrhoidectomy with anal fistula plug placement, incision and drainage of a perirectal abscess, laparoscopic sigmoid colostomy, and colostomy take-down. His physical exam revealed a soft, nontender, nondistended abdomen. The previous colostomy site and surgical incisions were well-healed. On anorectal exam, there were perianal inflammatory changes consistent with pCD and small tags with minimal induration on the left aspect of the anal canal. There were no abscesses or active sites of drainage. Pertinent labs were within normal limits including a normal C-reactive protein, a normal genotype for thiopurine S-methyltransferase, and a negative intestinal tuberculosis workup. Initial management consisted of switching from Ustekinumab to Infliximab.

Perianal fistulizing CD remains a challenging condition, with anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (Anti-TNF) being the preferred, and effective therapy in the majority of cases. Ustekinumab (UST) is in off-label use for refractory CD in children especially those who don’t show a response to anti-TNF. However, data on safety and efficacy in children is limited. Our patient is 15-year-old girl, started to have a recurrent perianal and labial abscess at age of 11 yr. Despite having a normal upper and lower colonoscopy in the first place, pathology examination showed mild regenerative glandular alterations in the rectum. However, she continued to have recurrent peri-anal and vulval abscesses, in November 2016, April 2017, June 2017, and February 2018, which required multiple incision, drainage, fistulotomy as well as antibiotics therapy. Further evaluation revealed an isolated perianal Crohn’s disease for which she was commenced to Adalimumab, and despite optimal dosing, she continued to have an active disease with partial response evidenced by biochemical and radiological findings. The decision was made to shift from Adalimumab to weight-based UST doses based on the promising results in adult CD. Our patient was followed frequently to ensure good therapeutic drug level, inflammatory markers improved from the maximum during her active disease till the last readings (56 weeks after starting UST), ESR (2-34 mm/hr) of 46 to 15 and CRP (1.0-1.7) of 21 to 0.2. Albumin and fecal calprotectin remain within normal range throughout her disease course. Repeated MRI showed Interval resolution of ischiorectal/ischioanal collection, almost complete resolution of transsphincteric fistulous tract while another intersphincteric fistula remained unchanged. Nonetheless, our patient reported a significant improvement in her perianal pain and weight gain of 6 kg during the interval assessment at 56 weeks of therapy. UST therapy shows a modest response in treating perianal CD in adult population,  The safety and efficacy of UST use in pediatrics remain an area to improve by conducting large, prospective, randomized, and controlled trials.

    "findings_text": "The skin is an important organ that covers the human body and interacts directly with the outside world. It plays a key role in immunity, feeling, and protection. In recent years, silica nanoparticles (SNPs) and their multifunctional carriers have gained considerable attention due to their significant advantages in drug delivery. Applications of polymer-coated MSNs in various therapeutic fields, including photodynamic therapy (PDT), photothermal therapy (PTT), chemotherapy, RNA delivery, wound healing, tissue engineering, food packaging, and the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Reprinted from Nair A, Chandrashekhar H R, Day CM, et al. Polymeric functionalization of mesoporous silica nanoparticles: biomedical insights.  Over the past few decades, advancements in nanotechnology have led to the emergence of various nanomaterials and nanomaterial-based drug delivery systems, which have been applied to wound repair and regeneration. Skin wounds are defined as disruptions or damage to the structure and function of the skin caused by various factors, including trauma, burns, and physiological or medical conditions. Following injury, damaged skin initiates a complex repair process involving the interplay of various cell types, cytokines, and biological mediators. Under normal conditions, this process progresses through distinct stages, including hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling ( Damaged skin initiates a complex repair process involving the interaction of multiple cell types, cytokines, and biological mediators. Under normal conditions, this process undergoes a series of stages, including hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. Adapted from from Cioce A, Cavani A, Cattani C, Scopelliti F. Role of the Skin Immune System in Wound Healing.  Immediately after injury, the body triggers hemostatic responses to minimize blood loss. Local blood vessels constrict via smooth muscle contraction to limit blood flow, and both intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways are activated. The inflammatory phase typically occurs from day 2 to day 5 post-injury. During this phase, platelets activated by thrombin release various growth factors, including epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and transforming growth factors (TGF-α and TGF-β). From 3 days to 2 weeks post-injury, the wound enters the proliferative phase, characterized by cell proliferation and migration. The remodeling phase involves structural reorganization and cellular reduction. Type III collagen in the granulation tissue is gradually replaced by type I collagen, the primary matrix component of the dermis. The rearrangement, cross-linking, and alignment of collagen fibers involve the dynamic synthesis of collagen and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), leading to ECM strengthening and contraction, and ultimately the formation of mature scar tissue.

    "title": "First Reported Successful Use of Infliximab Maintenance Therapy for Dual Treatment of Crohn Disease and Idiopathic Retroperitoneal Fibrosis",
    "clinical_history": "",
    "findings_text": "Crohn disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) characterized by transmural inflammation that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus. Clinical manifestations include diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, fatigue, and extraintestinal features such as arthritis and skin lesions. Perianal involvement—particularly anal fistulas and fissures—is frequently associated with more severe disease. Management typically involves immunosuppressive therapy and biologic agents, including antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) medications to control inflammation and prevent complications. Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis (IRF) is a rare, often underdiagnosed condition characterized by inflammation and fibrosis in the retroperitoneal space, which can obstruct surrounding structures such as the ureters, iliac vessels, and abdominal aorta. The estimated incidence of IRF ranges from 0.1 to 1.3 cases per 100,000 individuals annually, highlighting its rarity. The co-occurrence of CD and IRF is exceedingly rare, and only a handful of cases have been reported in the literature. Although associations between ulcerative colitis and IRF have also been documented, the connection between CD and IRF seems to be more commonly observed. This association likely stems from the immune dysregulation and chronic inflammation seen in CD, which can contribute to fibrotic changes in the retroperitoneum. The transmural inflammation in CD, which affects all layers of the bowel wall, including the serosa, likely interacts with the intra-abdominal cavity, increasing the risk of retroperitoneal involvement. Although the precise pathophysiology of this relationship remains unclear, CD with a fistulizing phenotype, characterized by severe transmural inflammation and recurrent tissue damage, is considered more likely to develop IRF. This overlap in clinical features between CD, IRF, and other conditions such as neoplasms can complicate the diagnosis and delay appropriate treatment. Early recognition and management of IRF are critical to preventing complications such as ureteral obstruction and renal damage. Treatment of IRF typically involves corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents, with emerging evidence suggesting that biologics such as infliximab, a TNF-alpha inhibitor, could be beneficial in treating refractory IRF. A 34-year-old man with a diagnosis of CD in 2018 presented with hematochezia, which led to the identification of an anal fissure and perianal fistula. There was no family history of IBD. He underwent an examination under anesthesia but did not require seton placement as the fistula was draining. Colonoscopy revealed severe ulcerations in both the small and large bowel, consistent with CD. Initially, he was treated with weekly adalimumab, which was later reduced to a biweekly regimen as his disease became inactive. Over time, he began to take the medication inconsistently, administering it approximately every 3 to 4 weeks w",

She then underwent perineal evacuation of blood clots. A few days later, following surgery, she started passing faeces and flatus per vagina. This was managed by proximal diversion colostomy. For persistent menstrual symptoms, she underwent multiple sessions of drainage of hematometra followed by total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy and attempted repair of perineal deformity elsewhere before being referred to us. The main presenting symptom was passage of mucous discharge per vagina with stoma in situ in left iliac fossa. No significant history of chronic illness. Not contributory. Perineal examination revealed absent anterior wall of anorectum and rectovaginal septum with single cavity of vagina and anal canal (common cloaca, Figure  \n All required laboratory investigations done were within normal limits. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pelvis revealed absence of uterus and bilateral ovaries with defect in anterior wall of anal canal and lower rectum involving half circumference of the internal and external sphincter anteriorly.

Posterior wall of vagina along with anterior wall of anal canal and part of lower rectum were absent. External sphincter was absent from 9 o' clock to 3 o' clock. Ends of sphincter were retracted and thinned out. The retracted ends of the posterior wall of vagina were separated from the retracted ends of the anorectum.

Lipoma noted in the perianal position since birth, is called as congenital perianal lipoma and is rarely reported in literature; usually associated with other congenital anomalies like, genito urinary or anorectal malformations (ARM). Congenital perianal lipoma on one side and associated with an accessory scrotum on the opposite side is rarely reported in neonate. One month old male baby born to non-consanguineously married couple, by full term caesarean section with a birth weight of 2.6kg, was brought to us with a painless, non-tender soft tissue swelling on the left side of the anal canal noticed since birth. On examination, there was a left sided perianal soft tissue swelling of size 7cm × 5cm just posterior to well-developed scrotum with bilaterally descended testis in it, without any redness over the swelling. There was an accessory scrotum of size 2 cm × 2 cm just posterior to orthotopic scrotum on right side without any testis in it, lying at the anterosuperior limit of the left sided perianal swelling. Baby had normal phallus and normally placed anal orifice without any spinal or other systemic anomalies.

Physiological changes in pregnancy, overlapping symptomatology, and concerns about fetal safety limit the use of certain diagnostic tools. When compounded with chronic gastrointestinal diseases like Crohn’s, the evaluation becomes even more complex. We report a rare case of a pregnant woman with Crohn’s disease who presented with an acute abdomen, ultimately diagnosed as perforated left-sided appendicitis in the setting of large bowel malrotation. A 36-year-old Gravida 4, Para 3, woman at 5 weeks and 6 days gestation (confirmed by ultrasound) presented to the emergency department (ED) with acute, progressive abdominal pain localized initially to the left lower quadrant, associated with nausea and three episodes of non-bloody, non-bilious vomiting. She had no fever, diarrhea, or urinary symptoms. Her past medical history was significant for Crohn’s disease (fistulizing perianal subtype) diagnosed in 2008, previously treated with infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, and currently on Ustekinumab every four weeks.  Her surgical history included three cesarean sections, multiple incision and drainage procedures for perianal abscesses, and a perianal fistula repair. Her most recent dose of Ustekinumab was administered 10 days prior to presentation.  On examination, she appeared well, with hemodynamic parameters within normal limits. The abdominal exam revealed generalized tenderness without peritoneal signs. The urine pregnancy test was positive, and the serum β-hCG measured 19,957 IU/L. Bedside ultrasound confirmed an intrauterine gestation with fetal cardiac activity as well as uncomplicated biliary stones. Laboratory studies demonstrated leukocytosis and elevated inflammatory markers (ESR 114 mm/hr, CRP 60 mg/L). An MRI abdomen was performed to assess possible causes of progressive abdominal pain, including a flare-up or complication of her IBD, the scan was inconclusive for any specific surgical pathology, but demonstrated free pelvic fluid and a suspected ruptured ovarian cyst vs. possible heterotopic pregnancy (Fig.  Axial cut MRI- demonstrating free fluid with a left-sided possible adaxial mass Despite pain management with intravenous opioids, her abdominal pain worsened, raising concern for an underlying surgical cause. Gynecology was consulted to assess the possibility of a heterotopic pregnancy and advised admission with repeat imaging and observation.

While abscesses, fistulas, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are well-recognized causes, perianal panniculitis remains a rare and often underdiagnosed entity [ Panniculitis refers to inflammation of subcutaneous fat, which can occur due to infection, trauma, autoimmune conditions, or metabolic disorders. When it affects the perianal region, it can mimic more common conditions, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment. Clinical presentations are often nonspecific, including localized pain, swelling, and tenderness, which overlap with other perianal disorders [ A man in his 40s presented to our surgical unit with a 3-month history of perianal pain, which he described as an intermittent pricking sensation, worsening after bowel movements. The pain was aggravated by consuming spicy food and had no identifiable relieving factors. He also reported a lumpy sensation in the perianal region but denied rectal bleeding, prolapsing masses, burning urination, or constipation. There was no history of weight loss or systemic symptoms such as fever or night sweats. The patient had no known comorbidities, and his medical, surgical, and family histories were unremarkable. He was not on any long-term medications, did not smoke, and reported occasional alcohol consumption. There was no personal or family history of IBD, connective tissue disorders, or dermatological conditions. The patient had been treated elsewhere conservatively for close to a 2 months duration. On general and systemic examination, the patient appeared well, with no signs of systemic illness. His vital signs were within normal limits. A digital rectal examination revealed an increased anal tone with a skin tag at the 6 o’clock position. An extra-luminal nodular growth was felt at the 11 o’clock position, which was firm, irregular, and nontender of size 3 × 2 cm on the right side extending from the right gluteal cleft.

    "clinical_history": "",
    "findings_text": "In recent years, there has been increasing attention on radical surgical procedures for low rectal cancer that balance oncological safety with the preservation of anal function. In the early 1990 s, Schiessel introduced intersphincteric resection (ISR) for the treatment of low rectal cancer [ Based on the extent of sphincter resection, ISR is classified into partial ISR (PISR), subtotal ISR (subtotal-ISR), and total ISR (TISR). Correspondingly, the anastomosis site after coloanal anastomosis is located below the levator ani hiatus (PISR, near the dentate line; subtotal-ISR and TISR, below the dentate line). However, after low rectal total mesorectal excision (TME) and subsequent coloanal anastomosis, participants often face a high risk of anastomotic leakage and pelvic infections, which usually necessitates a protective ileostomy. The ileostomy helps divert fecal matter, providing a relatively low perfusion environment that promotes healing for ultra-low coloanal anastomoses. In case of an anastomotic leak, the protective stoma can mitigate infection and reduce the risk of secondary surgeries. However, complications from protective ileostomy, such as dehydration, chronic renal failure, and parastomal hernia, occur in up to 43% of cases [ In 1961, Turnbull and Cutait independently reported a surgical technique involving transanal pull-through rectal resection and delayed manual coloanal anastomosis [ In 2009, Remzi et al. conducted a retrospective analysis of 67 participants who underwent the Turnbull-Cutait procedure for various indications such as rectovaginal/urethral fistulas, anastomotic leaks, radiation proctitis, and rectal strictures. Compared to 88 participants undergoing standard coloanal anastomosis, the Turnbull-Cutait procedure (delayed anastomosis) significantly reduced the incidence of anastomotic leaks (3% vs. 7%) and pelvic abscesses (0% vs. 5%) without significant differences in defecation, urination, or sexual function [ Therefore, it is highly worthwhile to conduct a multicenter prospective randomized controlled study to determine whether this technique can serve as an effective alternative to ISR-coloanal anastomosis, achieving comparable or lower rates of postoperative complications, as well as equivalent oncological radicality and defecatory function. However, most research has focused on rectal cancers located higher in the rectum (requiring only TME) rather than specifically addressing ultra-low rectal cancers (which necessitate intersphincteric dissection, ISD) and there is limited data on its use in ISR—an extreme sphincter-preserving surgical procedure for low rectal lesions [ This study targets participants undergoing ultra-low rectal cancer surgery, which requires internal sphincter dissection for sphincter-saving procedures. The study compares the staged Turnbull-Cutait Pull-through anastomosis (a delayed transanal pull-through anastomosis without a protective stoma) as the experimental group with direct anastomosis ",

Among the different kinds of sacral canal cysts, nerve root sheath cysts are the most common. Sacral canal nerve fascicular cysts were first reported by Tarlov in 1938, who conducted thorough and systematic research on them, hence they are also known as Tarlov cysts [ This 39-year-old Chinese woman patient presented with a 9-year history of progressive, recurrent, and recalcitrant sacrococcygeal pain, accompanied by discomfort in both lower limbs. In addition, she also reported a persistent sensation of anal distension. Her pain intensity was quantified as a score of 5 out of 10 on the visual analog scale (VAS). Notably, her symptoms were exacerbated during activities such as standing, walking, lifting, climbing stairs, and coughing, and they were not alleviated by resting in a recumbent position. Regarding the patient’s medical history, she had no significant prior health issues apart from an abortion 2 years ago. However, she exhibited bowel and bladder dysfunction, characterized by altered sensation for urination and defecation. Specifically, she experienced frequent urination (10–15 times per day), urinary weakness graded as 1 point on the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) sphincter function score, residual urine, and severe constipation. Constipation symptoms are very severe, and the frequency of bowel movements is only once every 3–4 days, so laxatives must be used to help with bowel movements. Preoperative ultrasound examination further revealed a residual urine volume of 150 mL. During the physical examination, the patient exhibited limb muscle strength graded as 5, with a negative straight leg raising test (SLR test). The jugular compression test elicited sacrococcygeal pain accompanied by paresthesia. Sensory assessment revealed diminished pinprick sensation in the plantar region and S1–S2 distribution. A sensory deficit was noted in the perineal region. The tone and contractility of the anal sphincter were within normal limits. Lumbar flexion alleviated the pain, whereas extension exacerbated it.

    "findings_text": "This large, multicentre inception cohort of newly diagnosed adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), with integrated biobanking and prospective material collection, enables exploration of IBD pathophysiology and biomarker discovery. The inclusion of symptomatic controls with gastrointestinal symptoms mimicking IBD but without evidence of the diagnosis provides a realistic diagnostic setting and addresses limitations of many previous cohorts. The use of healthy controls as a second control group offers opportunities to gain insight into IBD pathogenesis. The non-population-based study design and the predominance of university hospitals in recruitment may limit the generalisability of findings. Suboptimal sample processing at some centres, including delays in serum centrifugation and transportation of faecal samples at ambient temperatures, may have affected the quality of some specific analyses, such as microbiota analyses.  Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprising Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and IBD-unclassified (IBD-U), is a chronic disease that predominantly presents during the second and third decades of life. The disease results in an impaired quality of life for patients and substantial societal costs due to sick leave and a high use of healthcare resources. IBD often presents with non-specific symptoms such as diarrhoea, fatigue and abdominal pain and, therefore, presents a diagnostic challenge. Commonly used biomarkers in diagnostic algorithms include C-reactive protein (CRP) and, in some regions, faecal calprotectin (FCP) which help identify patients needing referral for further investigations, including ileocolonoscopy. At diagnosis, the heterogeneity in clinical presentation and subsequent disease course make clinicians’ attempts to stratify the treatment according to the individual patient’s needs very difficult. While some patients experience an indolent disease course with minimal symptoms and low endoscopic activity, a substantial proportion exhibit an aggressive disease phenotype characterised by treatment refractoriness, corticosteroid dependency, frequent hospital admissions and surgical interventions, including resection surgery and acute colectomy. To address the need for both diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, we established the ‘Swedish Inception Cohort in IBD’ (SIC-IBD), a large prospective multicentre cohort involving patients with suspected IBD referred to eight hospitals in Sweden. After a comprehensive diagnostic work-up, patients were classified as incident IBD patients or symptomatic non-IBD controls, that is, patients presenting with symptoms mimicking IBD but where IBD was ruled out. Alternative diagnoses in this patient group included infectious colitis, irritable bowel syndrome and diverticulitis.

The laboratory parameters were as follows: leukocyte count, 14.31 × 10 (a) Coronal T2W1 sequence showing poor disintegration of the bowel wall at the level of the deeper part of the tumor with the external sphincter, extending and pushing away the external sphincter to the sciorectal fossa and (b) Sag T2W1 sequence showing strong tumor–perianal sphincter association. Ultrasound-guided puncture biopsy. Pathology results. The combination of immunohistochemistry showed an origin in the smooth muscle. After preoperative preparation, we made a paranal curved incision and found that the tumor was located in the sciatic-rectal fossa, the upper edge of the tumor was adherent to the puborectalis muscle, the lower edge was adherent to the internal anal sphincter, and the root of the tumor was in close proximity to the deeper part of the external sphincter muscle and the rectal wall, with a rich blood supply ( Photograph of the tumor during surgery. Tumor removal. Postoperative pathology. SMT, which were first described by Virchow in 1854 as benign tumors, SMT in the rectal and perianal regions have different growth patterns, namely, intraluminal, intramural, and extraluminal. Most SMT in the rectum grow intraluminally, and those in the perianal region tend to grow extraluminally due to their origins in the mucosal muscularis mucosae of the rectum, intrinsic muscularis mucosae of the intestinal wall, or internal sphincter of the rectal muscle, which is a continuation of the rectal muscle. In clinical work, the diagnosis of SMT should be differentiated from diseases such as gastrointestinal mesenchymal tumors and SMS, including PA and many mesenchymal tumors. PA is a common morbidity characterized by acute onset and severe pain that is often accompanied with chills and fever. SMS is a malignant tumor with abnormal cell morphology, no clear envelope, and the possibility of distant metastasis. Benign SMS usually present as well-defined, slow-growing, painless masses, whereas malignant SMS are fast-growing, may be associated with pain or ulceration, and have invasive and metastatic potential. Differentiation between the two usually relies on histopathologic examination, including features such as cellular anisotropy, nuclear division index, and necrosis. In our patient, after initial misdiagnosis, the diagnosis of a perianal SMT was finally confirmed. Based on preoperative CT, MRI, and intraoperative exploration, it was confirmed that the root of the tumor was located deep within the external sphincter at the level of the rectal musculature, growing outward into the lumen and encroaching upon the exte",

In 2008, the patient’s symptoms were evaluated by infectious diseases and allergy/immunology services and he was diagnosed with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) due to his complaints of recurrent abdominal pain, bouts of diarrhea, joint pain, and continuous fever, in which his symptoms fit the Tel Hashomer criteria of FMF, yet there was no positive family history of first-degree relative with FMF. Colchicine 0.6 mg t.i.d. was initiated at that time, and follow-up revealed minimal symptom improvements. In 2015, DNA analysis for the FMF gene ( In 2011, the patient developed perianal abscesses and fistulas, and the pelvis magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a left intersphincteric fistula and abscess requiring fistulotomy and abscess drainage. In 2014, the patient developed recurrent abscesses in the axillae and inguinal areas requiring treatment with antibiotics and excision and drainage of the abscesses. The histopathology of both axillae showed fibrosis and inflammation compatible with HS. In 2015, the patient presented at the emergency room with diffuse dull aching abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and fever with chills and multiple joint pain in the elbows, knees, and ankles. On physical examination, the patient was febrile (38°C) and had oral ulcers. His body mass index was 25 kg/m Laboratory tests indicated the following: white blood cell count, 13 × 10 During follow-up, the CD was in clinical and biochemical remission on azathioprine. A colonoscopy in 2016 revealed improved mucosal disease, and histopathology showed mild chronic inactive colitis involving the rectum and sigmoid colon. The patient was followed up every 6 months, wherein he exhibited minimal symptoms of non-bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, and joint pain. In 2018, abdominal MRI revealed improved diffuse colonic wall thickening with residual featureless proximal sigmoid and descending colonic transmural enhancement, which were likely sequelae of the chronic inflammation. There was no evidence of small bowel disease. In 2022, the patient mentioned that his brother had recurrent fever and abdominal symptoms for many years and was recently diagnosed with HIDs at another institution following genetic testing and was receiving biological treatment. Previous serum immunoglobulin levels of our patient were requested and were shared as follows: IgA, 5.66 g/L (normal ran",

    "findings_text": "Perianal mucinous adenocarcinoma (MAC) is a rare and aggressive malignancy that arises in the lower third of the anal canal, accounting for less than 5 % of all anal tumors [ This study aims to present four cases of perianal MAC arising from perianal fistulas. Patients' clinical features, diagnostic challenges, and treatment strategies are discussed. Also, it focuses on the significance of surgical treatment as a key component of the treatment plan while also focusing on perioperative treatments to improve outcomes of patients with this rare cancer. A 53-year-old male patient presented with altered bowel habits and rectal bleeding. Investigations revealed rectal cancer, and the patient subsequently underwent low anterior resection (LAR) with ileostomy. During surgery, a perianal fistula located near the rectal adenocarcinoma and anus was discovered, raising suspicion of malignancy. A biopsy was taken from the fistula tract, followed by seton placement. Pathological examination of the rectal specimen confirmed well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, staged as T3aN0, with wide tumor-free margins. Furthermore, the fistula biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of MAC. Therefore, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) was recommended by our multidisciplinary team. Two months after NAC, the patient underwent an abdominoperineal resection (APR), perineal colostomy, and an antegrade colonic enema (ACE). However, the patient refused the placement of an ileostomy, so we closed it during a subsequent surgery. The pathology report revealed a T2N0 tumor with no margin involvement ( Baseline characteristics of patients, systemic and surgical treatments, and follow-up. APR: abdominoperineal resection; ACE: antegrade colonic enema. This procedure allows the patient to perform a complete colonic washout by flushing stool from the colon downward after inserting a water enema via a catheter. The patient was educated on how to irrigate the colon daily using one liter of water. This is likely to improve the patient's quality of life, enabling them to resume normal activities. This approach not only addresses the patient's medical needs but also preserves their body image and cultural sensitivities. Furthermore, the patient may experience reduced or absent soiling of undergarments. After surgery, the patient underwent adjuvant chemotherapy (AC). Twenty-nine months after surgery, a follow-up evaluation for recurrence of the tumor included a CT scan that demonstrated a distant metastatic nodule at the site where the perineal colostomy was embedded in the skin between the perineum and the colon. The pathology analysis confirmed that the metastatic nodule was adenocarcinoma related to MAC in a perianal fistula. Treatment included chemotherapy and local excision of the nodule. During a four-year follow-up period after diagnosis, no evidence of local recurrence or further metastases was observed, and the patient remains alive.

Human ancestors lost their tails almost 20 million years ago.[ A 4-year-old girl came to the neurosurgery department with pain in her lower back. Examination revealed she had a bulge in the lumbar spine, no motor or sensory deficits, and normal sphincters. The mother reported an uneventful pregnancy and no known perinatal infections. She had not taken folic acid during pregnancy. Ultrasound at 32 weeks of gestation showed no abnormalities. The infant was born at 39 weeks of gestation by vaginal delivery; she weighed 3.800 g, measured 50 cm, a head circumference was 35 cm, and had a bulge in the lumbar region with intact skin. The Apgar score was 9 at 1 min and 10 at 5 min consecutively.

    "findings_text": "\n Anorectal and perianal complications are among the most challenging manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). These conditions often require repeated assessments to guide therapeutic decisions, detect complications, and monitor treatment response. While endoscopy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remain the established standards for evaluation, they are limited by cost, accessibility, patient discomfort, and repeatability-particularly in scenarios such as pediatric care, pregnancy, or urgent outpatient settings. Transperineal ultrasound (TPUS), in contrast, offers a non-invasive, real-time, and bedside imaging solution that is repeatable, well-tolerated, and resource-efficient. In this context, TPUS has gained increasing attention as a non-invasive, real-time, and bedside tool capable of visualizing both structural and functional aspects of anorectal disease[ Despite its growing use, the role of TPUS in IBD remains under-recognized and inconsistently applied across clinical settings. Clinicians often lack clear guidance on its technical implementation, interpretation of findings, or how it compares with other imaging modalities such as MRI or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)[ In this review, we synthesize the current evidence and evolving applications of TPUS in IBD. We emphasize its potential as a frontline imaging modality in specific populations (children, pregnant women) and outpatient scenarios where rapid, repeatable, and radiation-free assessment is valuable. We cover its use in CD for the detection, classification, and monitoring of perianal fistulas and abscesses; in UC for assessing rectal inflammation; and in post-surgical pouch evaluation. We also highlight novel adjuncts such as Doppler imaging, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), 3D reconstruction, and computer-aided interpretation. By contextualizing these findings within clinical practice, we aim to clarify the utility, limitations, and future directions of this promising imaging modality. TPUS should begin with verbal consent, and the procedure is ideally performed in the presence of a female assistant when examining female patients. Bowel preparation is generally not required unless TPUS is scheduled on the same day as colonoscopy, in which case 1-2 L of polyethylene glycol solution may be used. To ensure patient comfort and modesty, disposable colonoscopy pants are recommended. The patient is positioned in the left lateral decubitus position with the right leg gently flexed at the hip and knee to allow full exposure of the perineum (Figure  \n The examination can be performed using high-end ultrasound (US) systems, equipped with high-frequency linear (2-14 or 2-18 MHz) (Figures  \n \n The probe is initially positioned horizontally anterior to the anus, with the vertical marker on probe oriented towards the operator.

    "findings_text": "\n Anorectal fistulas[ One major problem in diagnosing anorectal fistulas[ To overcome these diagnostic challenges, imaging methods have become more significant like low-spatial-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)[ Hydrogen peroxide-MRI (HP-MRI)[ In addition to obvious medical advantages there are many socio-economic benefits like with high accuracy HP-MRI could prevent repeated surgeries, which means lower healthcare cost. It also has improved the quality of patient’s life by maximising the chance of addressing the fistula completely at the first attempt & reduced the physical and psychological burden on patients who often suffer from discharge, chronic pain & emotional stress. HP-MRI collect precise anatomical information to develop the most successful treatment solutions for anorectal fistula. This advanced imaging methodology surpasses conventional methods considering the high sensitivity and specificity of 96.08% and 90.91% respectively for identifying interior openings. It shows not only greater accuracy but also real socioeconomic advantages by shedding light on previously hidden branches, decreasing missed abscesses, and lowering recurrence rates overall. When it comes to assessing an anorectal fistula because it allows for a better visualization of the fistulous network. Fistulas that are recurrent or complex tend to have subtle internal openings and additional branches not captured through regular methods such as low spatial resolution ultrasounds or MRIs[ HP-MRI is an important milestone toward more precise, effective, and patient-focused treatment for anorectal fistulas. It overcomes the limits of traditional diagnostics, such as low-spatial-resolution MRI or ultrasound, by allowing for a more distinguished identification of complicated fistula pathways, branches, and accompanying abscesses. Because of its high sensitivity and specificity, fewer extensions are likely to be overlooked, which is crucial for avoiding recurrence and reoperations. For patients, Single surgical operations mean improved quality of life: Fewer complications, faster recovery, and less financial pressure. Integration of HP-MRI in today’s medical industry is clearly in interests of hospitals and healthcare professionals & most importantly patients. Enhancing accuracy for the first diagnosis not only has straightforward medicinal benefits but decreases long-term expenses, embracing this cutting-edge technology is a necessary step towards advanced proctology and patient well being on a larger scale.

    "findings_text": "For colorectal surgeons, anorectal fistulas represent one of the most technically demanding and intellectually challenging conditions to manage. Treatment success requires surgical skill and a deep understanding of anorectal anatomy and its variations. Anorectal fistulas are characterized by an abnormal epithelialized connection between the anal canal or rectum and the perianal skin [ The management of anorectal fistulas has considerably evolved since ancient times. Contemporary surgical approaches have expanded beyond traditional fistulotomy to include sophisticated sphincter-sparing procedures, with technique selection heavily dependent on precise anatomical assessments. This evolution reflects a growing understanding of the critical balance between complete fistula eradication and preservation of anal continence. Recent studies have shown that inappropriate technique selection can lead to incontinence rates as high as 45% in complex cases. Parks' classification remains a cornerstone in surgical planning, categorizing fistulas into four types: intersphincteric, transsphincteric, suprasphincteric, and extrasphincteric [ Recent advancements in imaging techniques have significantly improved preoperative assessments. Modern imaging modalities, particularly high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 3-dimensional (3D) endoanal ultrasound (EAUS), now provide unprecedented anatomical details, with recent studies demonstrating accuracies of up to 98% in delineating the fistula anatomy. This enhanced imaging capability allows surgeons to plan more precise and targeted interventions [ This review aimed to provide practicing surgeons with a detailed anatomical framework for understanding fistula pathogenesis, practical strategies for managing complex and recurrent cases, and updates on emerging technologies and their anatomical implications. Various surgical management techniques have been evaluated using an anatomical lens. Traditional methods, such as fistulotomy, have a success rate of 92–97% for simple fistulas but carry a risk of incontinence in up to 45% of cases of complex fistulas [ We emphasize the importance of a tailored approach to fistula management, based on individual patient anatomy and fistula characteristics. Extensive cohort studies have demonstrated improved outcomes with personalized treatment strategies [ By synthesizing the current evidence and highlighting the critical role of anatomy in successful fistula management, this review seeks to enhance clinical decision-making and ultimately improve patient outcomes in this challenging area of colorectal surgery. We aimed to provide clinicians with a comprehensive, evidence-based resource to bridge the gap between anatomical knowledge and practical surgical applications.

The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the People’s Hospital of Liuyang (No. 2023-013). Since the MRI examinations require the intravenous injection of the contrast agent gadopentetate monoglucoside (Gd-DTPA), patients signed an informed consent form for the contrast injection prior to the MRI scan, and also provided consent for any surgeries or related procedures beforehand. This is a retrospective study, and an application to waive the requirement for informed consent for the retrospective collection of data was approved by the medical ethics committee after review. We initially retrieved 203 cases of anal fistula from the picture archiving and communication systems (PACS, Diagnostic imaging workstation; Neusoft Corporation, Shenyang, China). Following the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 168 patients with confirmed diagnoses of anal fistula were recruited in the Radiology Department of the People’s Hospital of Liuyang between November 2021 and November 2023, and all cases were assessed using MRI. The inclusion criterion was clinically diagnosed anal fistula that was subjected to MRI examination within seven working days before surgery. The clinical objective was to “cure while preserving anal function”. Treatment options were selected or combined based on the specific condition of the patient and can be categorized into surgeries that damage the sphincter and those that preserve sphincter function.

Traditional invasive treatment options aim to eliminate the fistula tract and to close the internal opening. Notably, such procedures carry the risk of damaging the anal sphincter complex and potentially lead to faecal incontinence symptoms [ One sphincter-preserving technique in the treatment of anal fistulas is the use of autologous compound platelet-rich fibrin foam, a novel application of fibrin matrix [ However, its efficacy is not well studied in the literature. Pérez Lara et al. included 60 anal fistula patients who were treated with platelet-rich fibrin foam in a prospective longitudinal multicentre study and observed a success rate of 66.6% after a follow-up of 24 months [ Obsidian RFT Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) enables the liberation of multiple growth factors crucial for cellular proliferation and angiogenesis [ The aim of our study was to analyse the efficacy of an autologous compound platelet-rich fibrin foam, Obsidian RFT®, in treating anal fistula. A retrospective single-centre cohort study was performed between January 2018 and 2022. Fifteen patients (5 female), receiving an anal fistula closure with Obsidian RTF In our institution, Obsidian RFT is offered to patients with anatomically complex anal fistulas (high transsphincteric, suprasphincteric or extrasphincteric) and to patients with anatomically simple anal fistulas (low transsphincteric, intersphincteric or superficial) who are considered at high risk of faecal incontinence if a fistulotomy is performed. This includes females with anterior fistulas, some degree of associated faecal incontinence, previous anal surgeries or Crohn’s disease patients without clinical or endoscopic signs of rectal disease activity. Fistula healing was defined as the closure of all treated external openings and no secretion after external finger compression without symptoms of the disease.

Abbreviation: HS, hidradenitis suppurativa. There is a paucity of data on the utility of USG in HS among dermatologists, radiologists, and surgeons alike, especially in India, with the lack of standard reporting systems making it difficult to manage HS and assess therapeutic response. The data regarding HS patients in India is scarce, and the role of USG in managing HS in Indian centers has not been established. We aimed to assess the severity of HS by clinical and sonographic methods in suspected cases of HS and determine if the predecided therapy based on clinical severity was appropriate. We also aimed to identify the risk factors on USG findings that can predict the failure to respond to treatment and changing the management line from medical to surgical. Our secondary aim was to exclude differentials and define the classical skin features of HS on USG. An observational cross-sectional study involving the patients suspected of HS was conducted at the Department of Dermatology and Department of Plastic Surgery at Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital. The study population consisted of patients who met the clinical diagnostic criteria of HS, defined by recurrent painful or suppurating lesions more than or equal to two times over 6 months.

    "findings_text": "Highlights Identifications of internal fistula opening and course of fistula tract is paramount for successful treatment of anal fistula. Goodsall’s rule is commonly used to predict the course of fistula and internal fistula opening. Its accuracy has been questioned by several investigators. Goodsall’s rule could be accurate for posterior long tract fistulas, horseshoe fistulas and short tract anterior fistulas. For long tract anterior fistulas, midline rule is more accurate. Short tract posterior fistulas could be open in a direct radial fashion. Fistula-in-ano is an abnormal tract lined by granulation tissue which connects between the epitheliazed surface of anal canal or the rectum and the perianal skin or perineum. It develops most frequently from spontaneously draining anorectal abscess which evolves from infection and suppuration of anal crypt glands at dentate line Surgery is still the main treatment modality for perianal fistulas. Several surgical procedures were practiced for eradication of anal fistulas with variable success rate depending on certain factors such as type of the fistula whether simple or complex, single or multiple, primary or secondary to other conditions such as inflammatory bowel diseases, namely Crohn’s diseases or malignancy Although the Goodsall’s rule is still widely used as a preliminary guide for identification of internal fistula opening in general surgical practice, the accuracy of Goodsall’s rule were questioned by several researchers and its overall predictive accuracy was a controversial topic among investigators This is a case series prospective study conducted for the period between April 2016 and March 2023, in which in which 320 adult consecutive patients attending private surgical clinic (224 males, 96 females) were enroled. Ages ranges from 16 to 64 years and mean body mass index 24.8±5.5 average 18.5–30.6).

    "clinical_history": "",
    "findings_text": "A fistula is an unusual communication between the organs or between an inward organ and the skin. Anorectal fistulas are chronic inflammatory disorders affecting the peri-anal tissues that join the perineal skin and the anal canal [ There are several potential causes of anal gland infection or fistula formation, including inflammatory bowel disorders, pelvic sepsis, diabetes mellitus, cancer, perineal trauma, and congenital factors [ Inflammation in the intersphincteric plane is common in cases of anal gland sepsis. It progresses along the intersphincteric plane to the perianal skin, a phenomenon found in approximately 70% of fistula cases. Another sort, transsphincteric fistulization, incorporates the infection going through the two layers of the butt-centric sphincter and the ischiorectal fossa; this occurs in around 20% of cases. Fistulous plots might bring about sore pits anyplace along their course; ischiorectal fossa abscesses are common in transsphincteric fistulas. Suprasphincter fistulization happens when infection sidesteps the sphincter complex and enters the ischiorectal fossa. Likewise, extrasphincteric or translevator fistulas might create assuming infection spreads from the pelvis to the skin through the ischiorectal fossa. Even after surgery that seems to be effective, there is a notable tendency for some fistulas to have recurrence rates of up to 25%. Often, the recurrences are the result of untreated infections from the original operation that were missed [ For a long time, the imaging method for anorectal fistulas was traditional fistulograms. Using this technique, the exterior opening is first accessed, and then the fistula is injected with a water-soluble contrast. There are two significant drawbacks to this strategy. First, when the primary tract and its extensions are blocked by pus or debris, the area is not completely visible because the area does not fill with contrast. Secondly, the sphincter muscle anatomy is not imaged [ Even though fistula in ano is not evaluated using computed tomography (CT), its poor soft tissue distinction and restricted imaging capability limit the accuracy of fistula classification. The attenuation values of the sphincter muscles, fibrotic areas, and fistula tract are comparable to each other, which limits the use of CT fistulography [ Milligan and Morgan first proposed the surgical classification of anal fistulae in 1934, and Stelzner and Goligher later modified it [ The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a diagnostic and preoperative assessment tool for fistula in ano has led to substantial breakthroughs in imaging methods, with MRI interpretations agreeing with surgical results in 14 of 16 instances [ The accuracy with which MRI shows the anatomy of the perianal area has been shown by Charles et al.

    "clinical_history": "",
    "findings_text": "Cutting setons have been used since Hippocrates. The cutting seton technique is based on the assumption that it causes an inflammatory reaction which stimulates fibrosis around the seton, preventing the sphincter from retraction when slowly divided. Unlike ‘laying open’ of the fistula tract, this technique should preserve optimal continence. Today, the use of cutting setons is controversial because of the significant patient discomfort after tightening and the wide range of reported incontinence rates [ Alternatively, a seton can be placed through the fistula tract and left loose without tightening, facilitating drainage. This loose seton technique is often applied prior to definitive repair and is also used as a palliative measure aimed to control symptoms and avoid formation of new abscesses. It is believed that long-term loose seton drainage causes distal migration of the fistula tract [ The aim of the present study is to assess the occurrence of distalization of trans- and suprasphincteric perianal fistulas after loose silicone seton drainage. Consecutive patients undergoing loose silicone seton placement for the management of a trans- or suprasphincteric fistula between January 2016 and December 2021 who met the inclusion criteria were studied retrospectively. Inclusion criteria were magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 3 months before loose seton placement and MRI after loose seton placement. In our centre MRI is routinely performed for assessment of perianal fistulas. Exclusion criteria were seton replacement after seton loss instead of primary seton placement and surgery between seton placement and MRI. The height of the external anal sphincter (EAS) and the level of penetration of perianal fistula through the EAS or puborectal muscle (PRM) were determined on pre- and postoperative MRI (Fig.  Measuring external anal sphincter  length and level of penetration.  Primary outcome was migration of the fistula tract through the EAS and PRM. The level of penetration of the fistula was divided by the EAS height to determine the proportion of muscle involved. Migration was determined by comparing the proportion of involved muscle before and after seton placement.

Common MRI techniques for anal fistulas include standardized sagittal fat-suppressed T2-weighted fast spin-echo (FSE) and axial T1-weighted FSE sequences, high-resolution axial T2WI, and coronal fat-suppressed T2WI sequences. Therefore, a sequence in the sagittal plane with a 45-degree slope forward from the vertical direction was performed first. The axial (i.e., the conventional position for the diagnosis or treatment of anal diseases, which corresponds to the surgeon's point of view and facilitates the location of the leak) and coronal sequences must be aligned with the anal canal in the sagittal sequence, oriented perpendicular and parallel to the long axis of the anal canal, respectively.

Mak et al. [ The surgical management of pCD most commonly consists of the drainage of sepsis with or without seton placement, and sometimes subsequent removal [ Studies of reparative surgery in pCD focus largely on minimally invasive techniques that avoid the division of the sphincter complex. Rectal advancement flaps involve mobilizing a flap of tissue to occlude the internal opening of the fistula tract, preventing inflammation triggered by gastrointestinal micro-organisms. Meta-analyses have found that success and recurrence rates in pCD are around 61 and 18%, respectively [ Less-well-studied minimally invasive techniques take various forms, generally involving cauterizing the internal surface of the tract, or scraping and then filling it. The Video Assisted Anal Fistula Treatment (VAAFT) achieves cautery under direct vision through cannulation of the tract with a rigid fistuloscope; however, studies on patients with pCD are scarce [ Despite (or perhaps due to) the wide range of procedures available for definitive treatment, most surgeons adopt a conservative approach [ However, there is evidence to suggest that a combination of medical and surgical treatment results in improved healing rates over either treatment alone [ There has been a recent shift towards addressing these deficiencies in pCD research, with several multi-center RCTs being conducted to examine the efficacy of various surgical and medical treatments.

Data gathered included demographics, procedural history, medications, operative details, and clinical outcomes. Outcomes included rates of symptom improvement, clinical or radiologic closure, recurrence, complications, and worsening fecal incontinence. Patients undergoing a planned staged closure were excluded from fistula closure rate analysis. Patients with a stoma were excluded from fecal incontinence rate. Perianal disease activity index (PDAI) scores were obtained for patients who underwent combination AFG and fistula plug treatment as part of a clinical trial (IIT-2017–10,082 treatment of perianal disease using adipose-derived stem cells). Pre-procedure PDAI was obtained within 8 weeks of surgery and post-procedure PDAI obtained at 3-month follow-up. Clinical improvement was defined as decrease in pain and drainage having significant impact on patient quality of life. Clinical closure was defined as resolution of all fistula drainage and local sepsis including no perianal pain, no seton, and visual closure of the external orifice on perianal exam. Recurrence was defined as persistence of the fistula 3 months after intervention or significant enough fistula symptoms prior to the 3-month end point to require a seton placement. Subgroup analyses were performed examining differences in outcomes based on number of procedures, IBD status, fat preparation method, diversion, and internal orifice management.

Proponents argue that the culture of pathogenic microorganisms is necessary not only to predict the likelihood of fistula formation after anorectal abscess surgery but also to guide the precise use of antibiotics and prevent antibiotic resistance ( The lack of a systematic comparison of microbial differences and source-tracking analysis of anorectal abscesses provided the rationale for conducting this study.

However, the aggressive laying-open technique may cause unavoidable harm to the anal sphincter, leading to different levels of postoperative incontinence ( This was a prospective study conducted on patients treated with the CTiF technique between July 2023 and April 2024 in a large tertiary medical center in Shanghai (Shuguang Hospital Affiliated with Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine). This study was approved by the ethics committee of Shuguang Hospital Affiliated with Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Study Approval No. 2023-1270-27-01). Written consent was obtained from all patients who were informed about the procedure. Inclusion criteria were patients aged ≥18 years presenting with HTAF. HTAF was diagnosed in accordance with the Parks classification ( All patients underwent MRI before surgery to delineate the HTAF tracts and their anatomic relationship with the sphincter. This imaging was used to facilitate accurate identification of the internal opening and tracts, thereby providing direction for surgical planning ( Preoperative MRI. Lithotomy and coronal section of preoperative MRI scan. (1) A curvilinear skin incision was made at the site of the fistulous tract between internal anal sphincter (IAS) and external anal sphincter (EAS) to enter the intersphincteric groove (IS approach) ( A 35-year-old man with HTAF treated by the CTiF procedure with complete healing demonstrated on follow-up  Postoperatively, all patients were prescribed 2.0 g intravenous cefmetazon, twice a day (1.0 g sildenafil was given intravenously once a day for penicillin-allergic patients). The duration of intravenous anti-inflammatory drugs was determined according to the severity of the anal fistula and the length of the hospital stay. Iodophor cotton slivers were used to clean the wound and were placed at the intersphincteric plane for drainage 2 times a day until the wound healed. Patients were considered to have postoperative recurrence if they experienced the following conditions:(1) previous wounds developed erythema, swelling, fluctuation, pus discharge from external openings; (2) self-reported pain and/or pain during palpation; (3) previous wound that did not heal in 3 months after surgery ( All patients were examined at the outpatient clinic by the CTIF surgeons once a week for 6 weeks. Thereafter, telephone follow-up was conducted every 4 weeks. Patient demographics, clinical information, and short-term clinical outcome data were noted through outpatient and telephone follow-up. The primary outcome measure of this study was the 6-month healing rate. The standard for complete healing of HTAF is when the skin of all fistula tract areas is free from tenderness, without discharge of pus from any canal or the anus ( SPSS Statistics 25",

    "findings_text": "Fistula-in-ano (FIA) is an intriguing problem of the anorectal region in the general population. A patient’s first visit and precise surgical management in the initial phase play a crucial step in the healing of the fistulous tract. Fistulectomy is among gold-standard procedures practiced for ages [ The prevalence in the general population varies greatly; in various European nations, it ranges from 1.04 to 2.32 cases per 100,000 people [ Risk factors for FIA include obesity, diabetes, impaired immune systems, low socioeconomic position, smoking, hyperlipidemia, and a sedentary lifestyle [ For FIA management, various methods have been recommended and detailed, such as fistulectomy, fistulotomy, and the use of cutting seton. The arsenal of these therapeutic options has lately expanded to include newer procedures, including fibrin plug, anal fistula plug, fistula laser closure (FiLaCTM), ligation of inter-sphincteric fistula tract (LIFT), and video-assisted anal fistula therapeutic (VAAFT). Due to anal sphincter injury, surgical treatment of FIA has a high risk of fecal incontinence and a large chance of recurrence. The risk of incontinence is associated more with the proximal location of the internal opening in the anal canal [ Since the previous surgical treatments had a significant risk of recurrence and fecal incontinence, a number of innovative procedures with minimal morbidity and great patient satisfaction have been developed [ There is no link between FIA and mortality; however, there is a strong correlation with morbidity. Chronic side effects, such as fecal and gas incontinence, recurrence, and anal canal stenosis, affect patients after therapy. The anatomic classification and surgical technique of the FIA will determine whether it will recur or not. Fibrin glue was first introduced in the 1990s and was thought of as a good idea for closing fistula tracts since, acting as an occlusive substance, it has a low risk of incontinence because it spares sphincteric damage. Fibrin glue showed a lot of promise for successfully sealing anorectal fistulae with few problems, but newer data reflect that the success rate had dropped from 80% in the early years to less than 50% [ There are four types of tissue adhesives, which are biomimetic, synthetic, natural protein-based, and hybrid. N-butyl 2-cyanoacrylate (n-BCA), octyl cyanoacrylate (OCA), and 2-octyl cyanoacrylate (2-OCA) are the different types of cyanoacrylate glue. Cyano helps in binding protein, acrylate helps in polymerization, and a combination of both leads to tissue healing. The term \"cyanoacrylate\" is based on the cyano, ethylene, and various alkyl groups [ A variety of techniques are being applied these days to treat anorectal fistulae, but none of them are without drawbacks, including incomplete healing, large perianal incisions or scars, incontinence, and recurrence [ In many ways, cyanoacrylate glue appears to be another good alternative cure for FIA.

At an outside institution, a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, which did not reveal Fournier’s gangrene or abscess formation, leading to a diagnosis of cellulitis. Despite a 10-day course of oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid followed by a five-day course of oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), the cellulitis progressed, and she developed an abscess. An incision and drainage (I&D) was performed, but unfortunately, no intraoperative cultures were sent. Over a span of two months, she was administered empiric azithromycin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and ciprofloxacin due to persistent symptoms. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the presence of a complex fistulous tract suggesting bilateral ischiorectal space abscesses and a horseshoe fistula (Figures  At our institution, she underwent three procedures: 1) I&D and bilateral seton placement from abscess internal opening to its bilateral extensions, 2) bilateral anal fistulectomy, and 3) I&D of ischiorectal space abscesses over a seven-month period.

    "findings_text": "Deep postanal abscesses (DPAs) are complex conditions that challenge clinicians due to their location, diverse symptomatology, and difficulties in surgical management. The deep postanal space is defined as the area bounded anteriorly by the external anal sphincter (EAS) complex, posteriorly and inferiorly by the coccyx and anococcygeal ligament, and superiorly by the levator muscle [ The primary goal in managing a DPA is to drain the abscess, eliminate the focus of sepsis, and, if possible, treat the fistula tract. Based on Courtney's theory, open surgical methods, such as the Hanley procedure or modified Hanley procedure, have been widely used to treat deep posterior anal fistulas, as well as techniques such as seton placement or flap advancement. Managing DPAs and related fistulas requires careful evaluation, a strategic approach, and extensive proctological experience. In this case report, we aim to share our treatment details and follow-up on a case of DPA accompanied by osteomyelitis. Such a local sequel of DPA has not yet been reported in the literature. A 43-year-old male patient with no comorbidities presented with ongoing coccygeal pain radiating to his back and his thighs. A digital rectal examination revealed a painful swelling in the proximal anal canal. A loose seton had been placed on the left lateral side at another hospital. Contrast-enhanced pelvic MRI was planned with a preliminary diagnosis of anal abscess. Laboratory tests revealed a leukocyte count of 7.8 x 10⁹/L, with neutrophils 5.12 x 10⁹/L. The patient had received oral ciprofloxacin and metronidazole treatment for four weeks at an external center prior to presenting to us. Therefore, we only evaluated the preoperative values upon admission. Since these values were within the normal range due to prior antibiotic use, we did not find it necessary to recheck the laboratory parameters. The patient had no fever or any septic signs. The MRI images revealed a 5x3 cm lesion consistent with an abscess in the deep anal fossa, with accompanying osteomyelitis at the S4-S5 localization (Figure  A: On the sagittal short tau inversion recovery (STIR) image, intramedullary hyperintensity consistent with osteomyelitis was observed on the opposite surfaces of the sacral 4-5 vertebrae.

    "clinical_history": "",
    "findings_text": "Acquired ano-rectal fistulas and sinuses are a prevalent condition, with a higher incidence reported in the male population [ Typically, these cases are identified when patients present with perineal pain or discharging cutaneous openings. However, certain patients may remain asymptomatic or exhibit atypical symptoms, leading to delayed diagnosis and progression to more advanced stages of the disease [ Although the anatomical proximity of pelvic genito-urinary organs to the ano-rectal region theoretically predisposes them to involvement, such cases are rarely documented in the literature. This rarity is attributed to natural anatomical barriers, including the mesorectal fascia, fascia of Denonvilliers, Colle’s fascia, Buck’s fascia, and the perineal diaphragm, which act as protective structures preventing the extension of fistulas and sinuses into adjacent pelvic organs. In this article, we present a series of four cases demonstrating the extension of advanced ano-rectal fistulas and sinuses into pelvic genito-urinary structures. This series highlights the diverse clinical presentations, the role of MRI in diagnosis, and the subsequent surgical management strategies employed in these rare and complex cases. Anatomical considerations and etiopathogenesis The anal canal is surrounded by the internal and external anal sphincters, which consist of smooth and striated muscles, respectively. The external sphincter is posteriorly attached to the ano-coccygeal ligament and anteriorly attached to the perineal body and urogenital diaphragm (and bulbocavernosus muscles in men) and continues proximally with the puborectalis muscle (which marks the ano-rectal junction), which in turn, merges with the levator ani muscles. The internal sphincter is formed by the distal circular muscle of gastro-intestinal tract [ The proximal half of the anal canal contains longitudinal mucosal folds, the anal columns of Morgagni. The distal aspect of each column is linked to its neighbor by a small semilunar fold (the anal valves), which in turn forms small pockets (the anal sinuses, or crypts of Morgagni). At the distal undulating end of these valves is the dentate (pectinate) line, which also marks the most distal aspect of the anal transitional zone, a histologic junction between the anal squamous epithelium and rectal columnar epithelium. The dentate line lies approximately 2 cm proximal to the anal verge and is a crucial landmark since the anal glands empty into the crypts that lie proximal to the valves. The origin of the anal glands within the surrounding tissues is variable. They may be present in the subepithelium or the internal sphincter, and approximately one- to two-thirds of these glands are deeply seated within the intersphincteric space (Figure  We hereby state that Figure  It is believed that infection of these results in the formation of anorectal sinuses and fistulas, in a process known as the “cryptoglandular hypothesis” [ The anatomy of the male pelvis alo",

Since Hippokrates described his pioneering treatment with a cutting thread through the fistula tract (what was later meant to be the “seton” procedure), one could say that many things have changed, but all remain the same [ Concerning fistula classification, several systems have been proposed since Parks introduced his well-established, nowadays, classification system [ Contemporary surgical approaches for complex anal fistulas still have the Seton method as a reference point, and many of the new ones would very much like to have the results of this method while also adding the best sphincter preservation. Even though new methods share the philosophy of the golden ratio between definitive treatment and anal continence, none of them has proven to be ideal. Although anal fistulas have been widely studied and various mechanisms of pathogenesis have been proposed, we still seem to be in shallow waters regarding their exact mechanisms of pathophysiology. In this study, we presented four different cases of anal fistulae that have been treated by this method of PRPs. Materials and methods PRP A total of 20mL of whole blood was acquired up to five days preoperatively from the patients. After adding citrate-phosphate-dextrose solution (CPD), first centrifugation at 270g for seven minutes was done to collect the plasma, and then a second at 1000g for five minutes to collect the platelet fraction. After these steps, the supernatant was discarded, and the platelet fraction was placed at -80°C for 30 minutes to lyse the platelets and release the growth factors. After leaving the specimen at room temperature for some minutes, one final centrifugation at 1000g for five minutes was carried out, and the supernatant was collected.

The choice between incision and drainage (I and D) alone or combined concurrent fistulotomy remains highly controversial. Proponents of the combined procedure argue that, based on the cryptoglandular infection theory, most anorectal abscesses would inevitably recur or develop anal fistulas after I and D alone, which can only be prevented by I and D combined with concurrent fistulotomy, thus avoiding reoperation[ Currently, anorectal abscesses are described according to their anatomical locations: (1) Ischiorectal; (2) Intersphincteric; (3) Supralevator; and (4) Submucosal abscesses[ Through years of clinical observation, we found that fistula-prone abscesses (FPAs) have an extremely high rate of recurrence or fistula formation after simple I and D, while non-FPAs (NFPAs) exhibit a substantially lower rate of recurrence. This suggests that this new classification of anorectal abscesses is reasonable. Therefore, this retrospective study was conducted to test this hypothesis and provide the basis for this new classification. Furthermore, we aimed to identify other risk factors that might predict recurrent anorectal abscess to guide the choice of surgical procedure.

The patient presented with a swollen, painful lump on the right buttock (1 cm × 1 cm) that was found after a long ride 5 years ago. The pain subsided after 2 days of rest. However, the swelling and pain recurred and were sometimes relieved by self-medicating with cefixime. Owing to worsened swelling and pain after a long ride 3 years ago, the patient sought medical help at a local hospital and was subsequently diagnosed with a perianal abscess. The pain was relieved by topical drugs but recurred every 2 months. The abscess began to spread upwards. Six months after topical drug treatment, the symptoms of the perianal abscess began to recur more frequently, approximately 2-3 times per month, and were not relieved by conservative treatment. The patient used to have good physical condition, and denied chronic diseases like hypertension, diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease. Surgical history was deniable. The patient and his family denied any history of infectious and hereditary diseases, smoking, alcohol consumption, major trauma and blood transfusion, or food or drug allergy. The patient was admitted for physical examination at the anus. The appearance of the anus was still flat. The sacrococcygeal region on the right side was 4 cm × 6 cm away from the anal truncus and a 3 cm × 3 cm hard mass was palpable, with weakly positive tenderness, normal skin temperature, and no obvious fluctuating sensation. Finger-pointing of the anus identified an anal verge at the 6 o’clock, 5 cm vertically away from the anus, located in the depression of the hard inner mouth. The right posterior rectal ring was hard without blood staining in the retracted finger. No directly relevant laboratory tests for reference. Ultrasonography of the perianal area using a high-frequency probe revealed a subcutaneous hypoechoic area on the right side of the sacrococcygeal area extending to the posterior anus, suggesting the presence of a high complex anal fistula. Hypoechogenicity was observed in the lateral sphincter at the six o'clock position of the anorectal ring, extending deep into the plane between the internal and external sphincter above the six o'clock position of the anorectal ring and spreading to the seven o'clock position on the right and five o'clock position on the left.

Case reports are therefore required for our better understanding and implementation of appropriate management strategies. A 66-year-old man with complex Crohn’s disease, diagnosed at age 32, attended gastroenterology clinic for routine review in November 2017. He had a medical history of gastro-oesophageal reflux. Previous surgical intervention included a right hemicolectomy with terminal ileal resection and synchronous proximal jejunal resection at age 40. This was complicated by psoas abscess requiring repeat laparotomy, washout and drain insertion. At clinic review, he had a symptomatic colovesical fistula, which was initially diagnosed at age 54, two perianal fistulae, initially diagnosed at age 61, and an intermittent enterocutaneous fistula in the right iliac fossa at a previous drain site. He also had chronic anal canal stenosis, requiring anal dilatation in the past. While he remained intermittently symptomatic from the fistulae at clinic, there were no complications requiring hospital admission and his symptoms were medically managed as an outpatient with full patient compliance. His medications included azathioprine 50 mg three times per day, alendronic acid 70 mg once weekly, calcium carbonate and colicalciferol D3 tablets two times per day, lansoprazole 15 mg once daily and hydroxocobalamin injections every 12 weeks. At the time of surgical clinic review, he had received his second infusion of infliximab. His main complaints at clinic were worsening of symptoms relating to his fistulae. Specifically, he complained of increasing white coloured discharge leaking from a perianal abscess.

Only a handful of cases are described in the literature, which have been mostly managed with open sigmoid colectomy. This case was successfully managed laparoscopically. Usually, presentations of peri-anal abscess proceed swiftly to examination under anesthetic (EUA). This case highlights the need to consider extra-levator causes of peri-anal abscess and to have low threshold for early imaging. It also demonstrates a good outcome through first managing the sepsis, then proceeding with a laparoscopic approach to definitive surgical management once the disease was quiescent. A 55-year-old male presented with a 1-month history of perianal swelling with increasing discomfort. Other than malaise, he remained systemically well. He reported 3 months of intermittent abdominal discomfort, thought to be related to constipation, which had resolved by the time of his presentation. He had no prior history of perianal abscess and had a medical history that was significant only for conservatively managed diverticulitis, with a recent colonoscopy confirming mild disease. On peri-anal examination, there was fullness and tenderness over the right ischiorectal space. The tenderness extended from 9 to 11 o’clock ~4 cm from the anal verge. No external opening was obvious, and there were no masses on per rectal exam. His abdomen was soft and non-tender. Bloods upon presentation revealed a mild leucocytosis (white cell count of 12.5 × 10 The patient was commenced on intravenous antibiotics and underwent EUA and drainage of perianal abscess. An ischiorectal cavity was found with small amount of purulent material. No fistulae into the rectum were identified. Further imaging was considered at thistime. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) identified a fistulous tract extending from the sigmoid colon, around the anterior aspect of the anal canal, with small collections in the ischiorectal and ischioanal fat.

He presented with fever, cramping lower abdominal pain and severe pain around the area of the buttocks. The physical examination revealed tenderness upon deep palpation of the right lower abdominal quadrant with no evidence of peritoneal irritation. An extensive perianal surgical wound was revealed, indicating the previous drainage procedures were performed through bilateral ischioanal incisions. No pathology of the scrotum and groin was observed. The digital rectal examination provoked severe pain and was not diagnostic. The laboratory studies showed leukocytosis (white blood cells number, 18.000/μL; neutrophils, 97%) and an increased level of C-reactive protein (CRP, 30 mg/L). The computed tomography (CT) scan, which was performed 5 days prior to presentation, demonstrated a posterior horseshoe abscess and inflammation of the right pararectal space. Due to the patient’s indolent clinical presentation, the complex perianal surgical wound and the persistent fever despite the multiple drainage procedures, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lower abdomen and pelvis was performed. As a new finding, an abscess cavity was revealed in the right supralevator space ( Initial resuscitation with crystalloids and intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics was followed by an examination under general anaesthesia. Prior to induction of general anesthesia, the patient received counsel regarding the emergency procedure, and written informed consent was obtained. Our institution’s policy is that a case report does not meet the criteria of research that must be approved by the Health Sciences Institutional Review Board (IRB) therefore it is exempt from IRB review. In the operating room, thorough inspection and wash-out of the bilateral ischioanal spaces were possible through the previous incisions. Neither an additional surgical wound to the perineum nor a posterior midline sphincterotomy were performed.

    "clinical_history": "",
    "findings_text": "Crohn's disease (CD) is an inflammatory bowel disease that may involve any area of the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus. A vast majority of patients have involvement of the small bowel, particularly the terminal ileum. Nearly half of all patients have some involvement of the colon. Patients typically experience diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, and fever. Patients with colonic involvement also suffer from lower gastrointestinal bleeding and perianal complications.[ Supportive laboratory data to diagnose CD include elevated serum inflammatory markers such C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum albumin, alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor, and some fecal markers such as fecal calprotectin.[ Confirmation with an endoscopic procedure with specimen sampling is often performed using ileocolonoscopy, which provides only limited access to the small bowel. Video capsule endoscopy can be used to visualize the entire length of the small bowel but does not have the provision of tissue sampling and is contraindicated in patients with strictures or bowel obstruction. While mucosal disease is well-assessed with endoscopic techniques, submucosal and serosal/mesenteric disease as well as intraabdominal complications cannot be evaluated. Description of the disease severity, exact location, and associated complications is necessary for appropriate clinical and surgical management. Traditionally, barium studies have been performed to evaluate the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract, but are now used less frequently due to poor sensitivity and specificity. Computed tomography (CT) remains a common clinical tool in the evaluation of CD and its complications. Because CD patients often undergo multiple studies over the course of diagnosis, they can be exposed to a high cumulative effective dose of radiation.[ Magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) is a radiation-free alternative to CT and is extremely useful in the management of CD. Usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as an effective modality to evaluate type and severity of inflammatory bowel disease and its comparability with endoscopy has been studied for the past two decades.[ When compared to conventional endoscopy, MRE has a sensitivity and specificity of 85% and 80%, respectively,[ When compared to enteroclysis, MRE has lesser sensitivity for detecting superficial ulcers due to inadequate distention.[ High diagnostic accuracy between high resolution MRE and surgical/histopathologic specimens in a series of 49 patients with CD was recently established in a study by Sinha  Fasting 4–6 hours prior to the examination is recommended in order to improve tolerance of oral contrast. Some authors have advocated the use of rectal enema the morning of the examination because fecal burden obscures colonic disease. Rectal enema has shown to increase the detection of inflammation at the terminal ileum, although this technique is not widely used.[ Adequate distention of small bowel",

Uncommonly encountered by the radiologists due to the diagnosis being based largely on clinical assessment, HS is more than just “recurrent abscesses” and has several important associations such as Crohn's disease and arthritis that may warrant further evaluation as well as potential complications, including complex draining sinus and fistula tract formation, fistula-in-ano, lumbosacral epidural abscess from deep extension, osteomyelitis, and squamous cell carcinoma developing in chronic inflammatory tracts. Imaging plays a supplementary but important role in both the early and chronic stages of the disease, aiding in the characterization of active lesions, assessment of the extent of involvement, and the recognition of complications. The use of advanced imaging modalities such as MRI, the modality of choice, has greatly aided in the management of these patients. To our knowledge, there has been limited discussion of HS in the radiology literature. We present a case report of a 56-year-old man with known diabetes mellitus and a 10-year history of HS and highlight through MR imaging findings, the relentless natural progression of the disease, characterized by recurrent exacerbations of abscesses and fistulae and complications of perianal fistulae and sacral osteomyelitis. We also demonstrate the appearance of this condition on PET-CT with F-18 FDG, which was performed for staging after postexcision tissue specimen revealed well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The association of arthritis and possible dactylitis, which were also manifested in our patient, will also be discussed. A 56-year old man presents to our institution with complaints of increasing right buttock pain and pustular skin lesions, which have worsened in the recent month. Medical records showed recurrent admissions over the past 9 years for gluteal-femoral and perianal abscesses and multiple perianal fistulae requiring repeated surgical debridement. He has had gradual but certain weight loss in the recent years. On clinical examination, extensive erythematous and pustular lesions were noted in the gluteal-femoral region bilaterally, with extension to the upper thighs (worse on the right), on background of rope-like dermal thickening and induration. Multiple fistulous openings were identified with visible purulent and haemoserous discharge. Perianal erythema is observed.

In mild cases, hemorrhoids prolapse during defecation but retract spontaneously. If uncontrolled, manual reduction is necessary. Severe cases involve prolapse triggered by increased abdominal pressure (e.g., coughing, sneezing, exertion) that is difficult to reduce. Surgery becomes necessary when conservative treatments fail. The procedure for prolapse and hemorrhoids (PPH) is a common surgical approach for treating grade III and IV internal hemorrhoids and mixed hemorrhoids. PPH offers advantages over traditional surgery in managing outlet obstructive constipation caused by internal rectal prolapse with circumferential hemorrhoids ( Procedure for prolapse and hemorrhoids causes less surgical damage, making it suitable for elderly patients and those with rectal mucosal prolapse.

    "findings_text": "Crohn's disease is a chronic, immune‐mediated disorder of the gastrointestinal tract, that is characterized by a relapsing‐remitting course with heterogeneous phenotypes. Perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease represents one of the most aggressive and debilitating forms of Crohn's disease, characterized by abnormal connections between the rectum or anal canal and adjacent tissue, occurring with an estimated prevalence of 14%–43%. The impact of this condition can be detrimental to a patient's quality of life, with increased severity of symptoms and an overall poor prognosis. The management of perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease is a major clinical challenge due to its refractoriness to medical treatment despite recent advancement in targeted therapies, as many patients still require surgical intervention [ Detailed evaluation of the fistula tract is essential to determine the optimal management strategy and to assess responsiveness to initiated therapies. Here, magnetic resonance imaging has established itself as the reference standard to assess the anatomy, the degree of inflammation and treatment response in Crohn's disease associated fistula tracts [ In the current issue of the  Altogether, this is a convincing pilot study addressing a currently unmet need in Crohn's disease, as objective evaluation of fistula tract response to initiated therapies still remains a challenging task. Various studies have indicated that fistula healing identified by MRI is a valuable outcome measure, as it is associated with prolonged period of clinical remission [ Some limitations of the presented study need to be acknowledged, which include the retrospective study design, the unicentric setting, the small sample size of included patients and the limited follow‐up time. Further data regarding the timing of observed volumetric changes between initiated therapies and differing outcomes concerning the type of treated perianal fistula would provide valuable further insights for prospective validation of this novel diagnostic procedure. Furthermore, differentiation of fibrotic and active components based on signal intensity on T2 sequences should be validated against histological analyses of the investigated fistula tract. This diagnostic method should ideally also include outcomes for both perianal and internal fistulae. Reduction in the volume of the active component of the fistula should also be correlated with newly proposed patient‐reported outcome measures, such as the Crohn's Anal Fistula Quality of Life scale [ Nevertheless, this study is of great value compared to the available literature, notably by being the first to assess volumetric changes of active and fibrotic components of the fistula tact and positively correlating it with clinical response to therapy. Overall, decrease in the active component in 3D volumetry on MRI might represent a valuable biomarker for defining therapeutic targets of treatment of perianal fistulizing disease, thereby addressing an ",

    "findings_text": "Pilonidal sinus disease (PD) is a chronic inflammatory benign condition that commonly occurs in the sacrococcygeal region, specifically in the natal cleft. Although the etiology and pathogenesis remain unclear, the most widely accepted theory is the penetration of hair, shed from the head, neck, or back, into the natal cleft, which induces a foreign body reaction [ Although PD is more commonly observed in males, risk factors include genetics, obesity, prolonged sitting, deep natal cleft, trauma, local irritation, and excessive body hair. PD may present with symptoms or remain asymptomatic. The most common symptoms include discomfort or pain while sitting, drainage or a feeling of moisture in the natal cleft, and the development of abscesses [ In patients with acute abscesses, the first step is drainage, whereas for chronic cases, there is no universally accepted standard treatment. Various techniques have been described for chronic PD, including excision with primary closure, various flap techniques, and non-excisional minimally invasive surgical techniques such as endoscopic pilonidal sinus treatment (EPSIT), video-assisted ablation of the pilonidal sinus (VAAPS), crystallized phenol application, and laser ablation [ The aim of this study is to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of laser ablation treatment in patients with recurrent PD, focusing on treatment success, recurrence rates, complications, and return to normal daily life. This retrospective study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Medicana International Hospital, Atılım University (Approval No: 21, dated 22.09.2023), in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Data were retrospectively analyzed from prospectively standardized clinical records. Patients who underwent laser ablation for recurrent pilonidal sinus disease (PD) between January 2022 and January 2025 were retrospectively reviewed. Postoperative follow-up was conducted weekly in the outpatient clinic until complete wound healing was achieved. After wound closure, patients were scheduled for follow-up visits at the 3 Patients with primary diseases, a history of inflammatory bowel disease, chronic steroid use, diabetes, autoimmune disorders, prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy in the anorectal or sacrococcygeal region, malignancy, or those who had previously undergone any form of minimally invasive treatment for PD were excluded from the study. Additionally, patients with a follow-up period of less than six months were excluded to prevent statistical bias. The study included patients aged 18 years and older who met the eligibility criteria and had undergone laser ablation for recurrent PD following conventional non-minimally invasive surgical interventions. Demographic data were recorded, and preoperative and perioperative information was obtained from clinical examination notes. Complete healing was defined as full epithelial closure of the sinus cavit",

The segmental transmural lesions associated with CD can lead to recurrent abdominal pain, diarrhoea, intestinal obstruction, and perianal lesions, among other clinical manifestations [ The diagnosis of CD currently lacks a definitive gold standard, requiring a comprehensive strategy that integrates clinical assessment, laboratory testing, imaging, endoscopy, and histopathological analysis. While pathological evaluation is central to diagnosing CD, practical issues such as sampling limitations and patient cooperation can complicate its application. Ulcers, a dominant manifestation of CD, can occur in any part of the gastrointestinal tract, including the small intestine [ Virtual Monoenergetic Imaging (VMI) using Dual-energy computed omography enterography (DECTE) has recently gained prominence for evaluating IBD [ Approximately 70–80% of CD patients involve small bowel lesions, with 30% presenting as isolated small bowel CD [ This study aimed to compare the diagnostic efficacy of small intestine DECTE and DBE in Crohn’s disease by evaluating their performance in detecting stenosis, fistulas, and ulcers; diagnosing CD across different clinical manifestations; and assessing disease activity in various inflammatory states. At the Endoscopic Centre of the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, patients with suspicious small intestinal disease who underwent DBE between 1 July 2016 and 1 November 2023 were included initially. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Diagnosis of CD [ The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Pathological results indicating conditions other than CD or inconclusive diagnoses, (2) incomplete data, and (3) the period between DBE and DECTE > 3 months. This study was reviewed and approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University (Approval No. 2024–249). Patients were instructed to follow a liquid or semi-liquid diet the day before DECTE. Patients ingested 68.56 g of polyethylene glycol electrolyte powder dissolved in 1000 ml of warm water twice on the night before examination, and on the day of examination respectively, until a clear, watery stool was obtained. One hour before the scan, patients ingested 2000 ml of 2.5% isotonic mannitol solution at five 10-min intervals. An additional 300 ml of the solution was used to fill the stomach and the upper jejunum. To suppress intestinal motility, anisodamine (10 mg) was administered intramuscularly 10 min before scanning. The small intestine was scanned using a Philips Healthcare IQon Spectral CT, covering the top of the diaphragm to the pubic symphysis. The patients were asked to hold their breath to enhance their image quality.

We retrospectively analyzed patients with complex pfCD who underwent FiLaC™ at Renji Hospital (Supplementary Fig.  Demographic data collected prior to surgery included age, sex, surgical history, smoking status, prior medications, and number of setons used. The perianal Crohn’s disease activity index (PDAI) was determined by grading five elements—pain, discharge, activity restriction, fistula, and skin changes—on a 5-point Likert scale, where higher scores indicate more severe disease [ All procedures were approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Renji Hospital, affiliated with Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine. Informed consent was obtained from all participants, adhering to the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations were routinely conducted prior to surgical procedures using a phased array coil (Ingenia; Philips Healthcare). The MRI sequences included coronal and transverse sections, with coronal and transverse sequences angulated parallel and perpendicular to the anal canal, respectively. T2-weighted turbo spin echo (TSE) sequences were executed as follows: repetition time (TR) 4000 ms, echo time (TE) 80 ms, field of view (FOV) 30 × 30 cm, scan matrix 256 × 202, slice thickness 3 mm, interslice gap 0.3 mm, and number of signal averages (NSA) 2, covering 24–32 slices. Additionally, a fat-suppressed T2-weighted TSE sequence was carried out in the transversal plane, with adjustments to a TE of 85 ms, also covering 24–32 slices.

    "findings_text": "neuroendocrine tumor The Union for International Cancer Control Perineal tear is a complication that occurs when the baby’s head passes through the vagina. Herein, we present a rare case of rectal neuroendocrine tumor (NET) incidentally discovered following a fourth-degree perineal tear, which was subsequently treated with robot-assisted ultra-low anterior resection. A 29-year-old woman experienced a fourth-degree perineal tear during the first vaginal delivery. The patient had no relevant medical or family history. Although the patient had no physical symptoms, gynecological examination revealed a rectal mass during treatment ( MRI, magnetic resonance imaging Perineal tears occur in up to 90% of nulliparous women, with the majority being first- or second-degree tears. Third-degree perineal tears involve partial damage to the external anal sphincter, and fourth-degree perineal lacerations extend from the vaginal wall to the external anal sphincter and then to the rectal mucosa, which require immediate suturing after delivery. The optimal time for rectal surgery following a perineal injury should be after complete healing of the injury. However, the time required for a wound to heal varies, and many factors influence the healing process. Simple wounds often heal within 30 days, while complex or contaminated wounds may become chronic. Robot-assisted surgery for rectal cancer is safe and now an important surgical technique for rectal procedures. Rectal surgery after a severe perineal tear may be associated with scarring and fibrosis around the rectum, and precautions should be taken during rectal dissection. We could safely perform rectal surgery after 4 months; however further research is required to determine the optimal timing for surgery, considering factors like the tumor condition.

One study reported that among 1284 patients of anal fistula and PNS, six patients had PNS communication with fistula in ano [ In this case, the patient was treated with interception of the fistulous tract and MIKKT. We present a case of recurrent PNS communicated with fistula-in-ano in a 27-year-old female and the subsequent surgical management based on Ayurvedic principles. A 27-year-old female arrived at the Shalya Tantra Outdoor Patient Department (OPD), reporting a non-healing wound at the natal cleft area and pus discharge from the wound persisting for two months. The patient reported undergoing two surgeries for PNS; the first, a year ago, an excision of the PNS tract was done, and the second surgery with flap technique was done three months ago. Despite the two-month duration after the second surgery, effective wound healing did not commence, and the condition persisted unchanged. On Physical Examination, the patient was fair, well oriented to time, place and person and vitals were within normal limit. Local Examination: On local examination, the wound of previous surgery presented at the natal cleft region, and the secondary pit was 3 cm away from the wound with the scar mark of the previous operation. On DRE, internal opening was felt at the 6 o'clock position at the level of the dentate line, which was communicated with the previously operated PNS wound, and the tract was felt up to that wound. The sphincter tone was normal with a normal temperature of the perineum and anal canal. Timeline of the case is depicted in  Timeline of the case. Pilonidal abscess, fistula in ano, PNS, and perianal abscess were taken into consideration for the differential diagnosis of this case. There was no sign of abscess, viz., tenderness, pus accumulation, and raised temperature of the body. While on examination, communication between fistula in ano and pilonidal sinus was found, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis region stated that there is communication between fistula in ano and PNS. So, perianal abscess and pilonidal abscess were excluded, and the case was diagnosed as a simultaneously coexisting PNS and fistula in ano. Urine routine/microscopic examination and Echocardiogram were within normal limits. Chest X-ray was normal. MRI of pelvis region showed communication between PNS and fistula in ano.",

In this study, we used a multi-omics approach including single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), mass cytometry (CyTOF), and spatial transcriptomics (ST) to unravel mucosal cell response in an extensive cohort of patients with PCD, CD without perianal disease (NPCD), or idiopathic perianal fistula or cryptoglandular fistulas (IPF). PCD fistulas showed hyperactivated pathogenic signals including interferon (IFN)G and TNF responses. Ileal and rectal cells from PCD patients also expressed increased IFN-γ-responsive and EMT genes compared to NPCD patients. Furthermore, we identified expanded IFNG+ pathogenic Th17 cells in both fistula tracts and ileal mucosa from PCD patients. Altered frequencies and inflammatory phenotypes of immune cells in the fistula tracts, external fistula opening, and rectum in PCD patients were uncovered by CyTOF. Moreover, molecular modules associated with anti-TNF therapy were identified in PCD samples. Altogether, this study identified IFN-γ as a potential therapeutic target for PCD. We recruited three groups of patients with a history of: 1) PCD confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis and/or examination under anesthesia (EUA) by a colorectal surgeon (n = 24); 2) NPCD (n = 29); 3) IPF without a history of inflammatory bowel disease, diagnosed on EUA by a colorectal surgeon (n = 10;  Cells were washed with Cy-FACS buffer (CyPBS, Rockland, MB-008; 0.1% BSA, Sigma, A3059; 0.02% Sodium Azide, Sigma, 71289, 2mM EDTA, Hoefer, GR123-100) and stained with antibodies on ice for an hour.

Chronic anal fistulas that persist for >10 years are considered a potential risk factor for fistula-associated cancers [ A 43-year-old male patient was admitted in July 2022 due to an anal fistula. The patient had a 15-year history of recurrent perianal abscesses with prior surgical intervention in 2007, 2011, and 2012. However, following each surgery, the wounds failed to heal completely, resulting in persistent drainage of purulent fluid through the external orifices and intermittent recurrence of perianal abscesses. Two weeks before admission, the patient reported a significant increase in perianal pain. Notably, the patient had no history of inflammatory bowel disease, but had been diagnosed with HIV infection for 10 years. Physical examination revealed two external fistulous orifices located at the 3-o’clock and 9-o’clock positions, ~3 cm from the anal verge. Rectoscopy confirmed that the internal opening was situated within the anal crypt at the 6-o’clock position, and laboratory tests conducted upon admission did not reveal any abnormalities. Colonoscopy was performed and no underlying intestinal pathology was identified. Perianal magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intersphincteric fistula ( Preoperative perianal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination. Postoperative pathology indicated squamous cell carcinoma. The relationship between cancer and anal fistulas can manifest in a number of ways [ In this case, the patient presented with a carcinoma at the site of an anal fistula. The patient had a history of chronic anal fistula for 15 years and a 10-year history of HIV infection. Preoperative colonoscopy ruled out the possibility of cancerous cells spreading from the anal canal and rectum to perianal tissue and gastrointestinal tract metastasis. Additionally, the examination eliminated the possibility that the cancer predated the fistula or that the anal fistula developed concurrently with anal canal carcinoma. Therefore, it is considered that the carcinoma arose secondary to chronic anal fistula. The precise pathogenic mechanism underlying squamous cell carcinoma associated with anal fistulas is a vital factor in cancer development [ The diagnosis of cancers associated with fistulas is challenging. Biopsy of the fistula tract is essential for diagnosis and early intervention [ This article presents the case of a patient with chronic anal fistula that ultimately progressed to fistula-associated squamous cell carcinoma, which suggests a potential link between HIV infection and the development of fistula-related cancer. The precise etiology and mechanisms underlying malignant transformation of anal fistulas remain unclear. Prognosis is dependent on early diagnosis and treatment, which emphasizes the importance of biopsy in the management of chronic anal fistulas. ",

The patient was admitted for suspected appendicitis at the local medical facility. Following this, an enhanced CT (computed tomography) scan of the abdomen revealed thickening and irregular enhancement of the wall of the proximal ileum, cecum, and adjacent ascending colon, accompanied by a surrounding mass shadow, suggesting a high likelihood of CD. The colonoscopy revealed the presence of a mass located at the terminal portion of the cecum. Subsequent biopsy of the cecum demonstrated chronic enteritis with ulcer and a small noncaseating granuloma within the muscularis mucosa. No special staining was done on the biopsy specimen. The administration of anti-infection and analgesic therapy did not yield improvement. Right hemicolectomy was undertaken due to the ineffectiveness of symptomatic treatment and the potential risk of intestinal wall perforation. Postoperative pathological findings in local hospital indicated that both CD and tuberculosis were potential diagnoses. After the surgery, abdominal pain was relieved. One-year post-surgery, the patient experienced an increase in stool frequency to 2–3 times per day with loose consistency. A repeat colonoscopy at the local hospital revealed histopathological findings of the ileum and rectum consistent with active chronic enteritis with ulcers and without granulomas.

In 2021, a total of 1,933,381 incident cases in India accounted for 28% of global TB burden.[ A 47-year-old male patient sought medical attention at the outpatient department, reporting persistent pain in the perianal region for the past 6 months. The patient denied experiencing fever, cough, shortness of breath, or loss of appetite. There was no history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The patient had not been previously treated with anti-TB therapy (ATT) and denied contact with TB patients. Upon local examination, there was a nontender induration of 4 × 3 cm in the right gluteal region at 7 o›clock position approximately 4 cm from anal verge and 2 × 2 cm in the left perianal region approximately 2 cm from anal verge without any ulceration or sinuses. The margin of the induration is diffuse with a smooth surface and without any ulceration or discharge. Initially, conservative management with antibiotics (ofloxacin and ornidazole (200/500 mg)) twice daily for 7 days was adviced and a sitz bath was started. However, the response was incomplete, and the patient returned with multiple abscesses over the perianal region. Incision and drainage were done. Although his condition improved after drainage, he again presented with pain and discharge drainage sites. The pus culture showed no growth, and the AFB and CBNNAT tests were negative. The patient was restarted on antibiotics (Tab ofloxacin ornidazole 200/500 mg) due to a partial response to the previous course. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was scheduled to determine the extent of the fistula and abscess. MRI of the pelvic region revealed enhancing irregular thickening of rectum for a length of 4 cm along with extensive soft tissue thickening around the perirectal region, perianal region, and medial aspect of the bilateral gluteal region. Tran sphincter fistula with internal opening at 5 o’clock position was also noted [ MRI of pelvic region showing extensive soft tissue thickening around perirectal and perianal regions Histopathology image (H and E staining) showing caseating granulomatous lesion consisting of multinucleated giant cells of Langerhans type Photography showing healed lesion after 2 months of treatment The occurrence of perianal TB is extremely rare, accounting for 1% of the GI tract, while GI TB makes up less than 1% of all TB cases.[ Perianal TB is mostly associated with direct evidence of TB foci in lungs or intestine. Sayaka Tago has reported a case of perianal TB that has concurrent pulmonary TB.[ The most common clinical feature of anal TB is anal fistula. Our cases presented as perineal abscess.

    "findings_text": "Coccydynia refers to pain in the sacrococcygeal region resulting from pressure on the coccyx, also known as the tailbone. Coccydynia is mainly idiopathic and develops from unknown causes. However, direct injuries to the sacrococcygeal region such as falling from a height and challenging vaginal delivery are known to be the cause in several cases [ Chronic refractory coccydynia, defined as persistent pain for more than three months, may mandate surgical management in the form of coccygectomy [ The standard technique for coccygectomy typically involves making a vertical midline incision near the coccyx, exposing the bone, and then carefully removing part or all of the coccyx and its ligamentous attachments. However, the technique may vary slightly depending on the surgeon's preference and the patient's condition. In a retrospective study [ A 41-year-old male presented in 2016 with chronic coccydynia for 10 years. This coccygeal pain radiated to his gluteal area and was typically aggravated by prolonged sitting. The pain varied in severity over time until it became so intense that it reached a pain score of 9/10, causing him an inability to sit. The patient did not have any medical illnesses, with a history of previous gastric sleeve and anal fistula repair. Different imaging and screening modalities were used to assess the patient’s condition, including sacrococcygeal X-ray, pelvis CT scan, and lumbar MRI (Figures  Operative details Before the procedure, the patient was commenced on a soft diet for 48 hours. He received two doses of Fleet Enema. The first dose was administered in the evening time one day before the surgery. The second was given early morning on the same day of the surgery. Cefazolin 2 g and metronidazole 100 mg were used as prophylactic antibiotics before skin incision. The patient was positioned prone on a standard Jackson table. Gentle traction of the skin and the gluteal area was done using plaster to further expose the midline crease. Under a C-arm, a vertical skin mark was made over the coccygeal area. The perianal area was covered with iodine-soaked gauze distal to our intended incision. Prepping and draping were done in the usual sterile fashion. A vertical incision was made over the coccygeal area. Dissection of the soft tissue was carried down to the bone using a monopolar. Subperiosteal dissection was carefully continued from the midline posteriorly down to the lateral side bilaterally. Using a blade, the sacrococcygeal disk was removed. Then using towel clips to direct the coccyx, dissection was carried from the posterolateral side into the ventral side while maintaining subperiosteal dissection. Hemostasis was controlled using monopolar and coagulation. Then the coccygectomy was completed, and no rectal injury was encountered. Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs were taken to confirm the complete removal of the bone. The distal edge of the sacral bone was rasped, and bone wax was applied. Thorough irrigation and loc",

Congenital tumors are the most common tumors of the presacral space, accounting for 55% to 70% of all lesions [ Tailgut cysts develop in the final section of the intestine from which the rectum and anus extend. The embryo develops a tail on approximately the fifth week of gestation that regresses during the eighth week of fetal life. The ectoderm then invaginates to the end of the gut and the anus forms. However, if this process is disturbed, a stray fragment of hindgut remains, and the tailgut cyst is formed [ Tailgut cysts are more common in females, with a 5:1 ratio of predominance [ Because of these lesions’ rarity and their potential risk of malignancy, we present two cases, which occurred in our clinic, to increase awareness of this type of lesion. First patient: The first patient is a 40-year-old woman with large intestinal hyperplastic polyps and hemorrhoids. The pelvis minor tumor was diagnosed in 2016 during a routine ultrasound, and the patient underwent an unsuccessful surgery the same year. The tumor was asymptomatic, but in 2021, the patient started to experience morning tenesmus, urinary outflow disorders and painful ovulation. The physical examination showed left-sided thickness in a per vaginam examination. An MRI scan the with contrast of the lesser pelvis revealed a cystic, multilocular mass measuring 8.9 cm × 8.1 cm× 6.3 cm. This lesion shifted the rectum forward and to the left. It pressured the reproductive organ. The MRI scan aroused suspicion of a tailgut cyst [ Due to the symptomatic character of the tumor, a laparotomy was performed. The peritoneum was opened with a midline incision. Aside from an inflamed left uterine appendage, no pathological changes were found. Then, the peritoneum was opened on the right side, from the rectum. A large cystic tumor was visible, filling presacral and precoccygeal areas. The tumor was dissected from the mesorectum of the sidewall of the pelvis, from the reproductive organ from below and from the coccyx bone going down to the pelvic floor where infiltration of the coccyx was visible. The patient was shifted onto their stomach and another midline incision was performed, which made the removal of the tumor and coccyx bone possible. Also, two accidentally detected small cystic tumors in the external anal sphincter area were removed. After checking tightness of the rectum with a catheter syringe and placing a Redon drain in the presacral area, the wound of the sacrococcygeal area was sutured. The pat",

Current research suggests that stoma closure is performed between 3 and 6 months after surgery, although some studies propose an earlier closure [ \nThe aim of this study, comprising patients with maximal re-leakage, was to assess the risk factors for rectal anastomotic re-leakage and develop a prediction model for the probability of anastomotic re-leakage following stoma closure. \nData from our database and medical records of patients treated at Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, were reviewed from January 2010–December 2020. The patient inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) preoperative pathological examination confirming rectal adenocarcinoma; (2) underwent laparoscopic surgery, including anterior resection (AR), low anterior resection (LAR), or ISR surgery; and (3) confirmed AL during hospitalization or recovery period. The exclusion criteria were: (1) emergency surgery for acute intestinal obstruction, bleeding, or perforation; (2) subtotal colectomy or total colectomy due to multiple primary tumors; and (3) individuals with distant organ metastasis. All patients provided written informed consent, and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (ethical approval number 22/503–3705). \nFor patients with preoperative stage cT3/N + advanced low rectal cancer, nCRT is recommended as a routine treatment. All operations were performed by experienced surgical teams, regardless of whether the anastomosis was stapled or hand-sewn, and a diverting ileostomy was routinely considered in ISR and nCRT patients. After the index surgery, basic judgments are made based on the patient’s vital signs, laboratory results, and whether there are any abnormal signs in the abdomen or drainage shape. Once AL is suspected, computed tomography (CT) or endoscopy is performed for further diagnosis. Protective measures such as active anti-infection, maintaining unobstructed drainage, and systemic nutritional support therapy can be considered for patients with ileostomy. For patients without ileostomy, secondary surgery is performed on the transverse colon or ileum stoma if there is apparent peritonitis or shock. The healing of the anastomosis in all patients with AL is evaluated every month in our outpatient clinic, with the first choice being an internal anal examination. If necessary, iodine oil imaging and CT scans are also used for further evaluation.

Upon evaluation, ultrasound examination showed a large abscess measuring 8×4 cm in the right ischiorectal fossa, prompting drainage through an endorectal incision and intravenous antibiotics administration (1 gram amoxicillin+clavulanic acid). Although the fever resolved and bacterial wound and blood cultures (aerobic and anaerobic) returned negative results, persistence of exudate from the lesion prompted further investigation. A subsequent MRI and colonoscopy exposed a narrow fistula extending from a large abscess in the ischiorectal fossa to the mid-third of the anal canal, leading to suspicion of ACD ( A 16-year-old girl (weight 50 kg) was referred to our center following the incidental finding of a large ischiorectal cyst discovered during a routine gynecological evaluation. She was otherwise in good health and had not undergone any previous treatments for medical conditions. A preoperative pelvic MRI revealed a well-defined homogeneous cystic mass measuring 7.3×6.3 cm in the left ischiorectal fossa in continuity with the rectal wall ( ACD is typically diagnosed early, in the first years of life, and there are few cases among older children [ Although the likelihood of malignancy remains low in case of ACD, surgical excision aiming for complete removal while preserving anorectal function is typically recommended for all patients, as early removal of the duplication can prevent potential future complications, including malignancy [ The choice of surgical approach depends on factors like anatomical localization, presence of an external orifice, surgical accessibility, and individual preferences. Various techniques, including trans-anal, trans-coccygeal, abdominal, and posterior sagittal approaches, have been described [ In the second case, due to the cyst being located exclusively within the ischiorectal fossa, after a multidisciplinary discussion, a robotic approach was preferred. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first case of ACD treated with a robot. The use of robotic assistance played a crucial role in facilitating a minimally invasive procedure, particularly within the confined space of the pelvis. The inherent magnification of the robotic camera and the dexterity of robotic arms played a crucial role in the precise mass excision within the confined areas [ Anal canal duplication should be considered in the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with lesions in the ischiorectal fossa. Clinical examination and radiological findings are essential for guiding the choice of surgical approach. For cases with an external orifice extending below the peritoneal reflection, a posterior approach may be suitable.

It is usually caused by infections or other diseases around the anus, including but not limited to perianal abscess, perianal inflammation, and Crohn's disease (CD) [ Mucinous adenocarcinoma is a unique subtype of colorectal cancer (CRC). This kind of adenocarcinoma is distinguished by its prominent production of mucin, a gel-like substance found in the extracellular matrix. In this subtype, mucin accounts for at least 50% of the tumor's volume, imparting a characteristic appearance of abundant mucin pools within the tumor tissue [ Therefore, we reported a case of mucinous adenocarcinoma in the perianal fistula of a patient with a recurrent anal fistula. This case emphasized the importance of multidisciplinary approaches in internal medicine, surgery, and imaging for disease diagnosis and treatment. A 54-year-old male came to the digestive department for treatment due to recurrent diarrhea. The patient has had recurrent diarrhea, accompanied by abdominal distension, weight loss, and occasional abdominal pain in the past 10 years.

We hypothesized that having a 3D model of the tumor and the surrounding structures would help anticipate potential issues in the operating room and the extent of the operation and improve the patient’s understanding of his disease process, all of which have been documented in the literature. The Institutional Review Board at our facility deemed it unnecessary to get informed consent to publish this case report. However, the informed consent process at the VA includes using deidentified information for publication, in which the patient signed and agreed. A 54-year-old male presented to the colorectal surgery clinic with the chief complaint of a painful anal swelling that had been ongoing for several weeks. He denied any obvious drainage but would occasionally notice some moisture. He had had regular bowel movements with occasional pain but no blood. His vitals in the clinic were a heart rate of 106 beats per minute, blood pressure of 145/87, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and a temperature of 98.2°F.

A rigid proctoscope was then inserted, and a posterior mass indenting the posterior rectal wall was noted and extended superiorly 11 cm from the anal verge. Once past the mass, the rest of the rectum and sigmoid appeared normal. Proctoscopy revealed no mucosal irregularities, and no pus was noted. Next, a fine needle aspiration using an 18-gauge needle with a syringe was inserted via the posterior midline perianal skin located one-inch posterior to the anal verge and directed superiorly into the retrorectal mass. Aspiration produced a red, gelatinous material. The aspirate was sent for cytology, biopsy, and culture, and the procedure was terminated. The pathology results were significant for strong diffuse expression of vimentin, CD68, and CD34 and weak patchy CD10.

His prostate was measured at 158 g by trans-rectal ultrasound (US) with a prostate-specific antigen of 1.06 ng/dL. After failing conservative management and resorting to chronic catheterization, the patient underwent a robot-assisted laparoscopic simple prostatectomy. The patient was fully informed about the nature, purpose, and potential risks and benefits of the treatments provided. The patient understood and agreed to each treatment plan. Consent was also obtained for the publication of the patient's medical data, and all personal identifiers were removed to maintain anonymity. After the creation of a midline cystotomy, the prostate appeared grossly abnormal, with significant bullous edema overlying the left lobe, surrounding the bladder neck. The surgical fascial planes were obliterated. The right lobe also appeared somewhat necrotic and friable, disintegrating with manipulation. After tissue samples were collected and a suprapubic catheter was placed, the procedure was aborted due to concern for infection.

    "findings_text": "Low rectal cancer refers to malignant rectal tumours within 5 cm from the anal verge. Currently, surgery remains the main treatment method for common rectal cancer, with abdominoperineal resection (APR)[ However, despite the major progress in the multidisciplinary treatment approach to rectal cancer, about 40% of rectal cancer patients will undergo an abdominoperineal resection, resulting in a permanent colostomy.[ Here, we propose a new method of combined abdominal and perineal resection, as an alternative to the conventional APR, that is, individualised resection of the levator ani muscle guided by laparoscopy to reduce the positive rate of CMR and ITP, reduce local recurrence (LR) and simplify the operation of the perineum. In addition, we provide evidence that laparoscopic-dominant abdominoperineal resection (LDAPR) is a safe technology for rectal cancer. The primary endpoints were CRM (+), ITP, 2-year overall survival (2-year OS) and 2-year LR. The secondary endpoints were the post-operative complications. This study retrospectively used medical records of rectal cancer surgery cases from September 2014 to December 2019. The experimental group included patients who had undergone laparoscopic-led individualised levator ani resection from January 2017 to December 2019, while the control group included patients who had received laparoscopic conventional APR surgery from September 2014 to December 2016. The ethics committee of Zhangzhou Municipal Hospital Affiliated of Fujian Medical University approved this retrospective investigation and waived the regulations of informed consent due to the design of the study. Solitary rectal adenocarcinoma or carcinoma diagnosed by colonoscopy and biopsy, and the anus could not be preserved; the high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) staging below T3a, and some T3b and T3c patients were reduced after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy; age <75 years old; no local infection such as anal fistula and perianal abscess; no severe cardiopulmonary, liver and kidney dysfunction; laparoscopic surgery and no sexual dysfunction and urination prior to surgery. Post-operative pathological findings of non-adenocarcinoma such as signet-ring cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma; medical records of T4 stage; patients with distant metastasis or local inability to undergo R0 resection, but palliative resection is performed; transition to laparotomy. The operation is divided into two phases: the abdominal and perineal phases. The abdominal phase is done according to the conventional surgical procedures that target the total mesorectal excision (TME) plane. It follows the principle of low anterior resection in laparoscopic anterior rectotomy that ensures the separation of the left Toldt space. The lymph nodes at the inferior mesenteric artery and the root of the vein are dissected at a high position and ligated.

Despite using the laparoscopic or robotic approach, the large perineal defect can make the reconstructive phase of this procedure extremely challenging, especially when an extralevator abdominoperineal excision (ELAPE) is needed; the process involves dissecting outside the extralevator muscles plane and removing the entire pelvic floor to achieve oncological radicality [ The main surgical techniques for perineal reconstruction after APR, in addition to the direct closure of the perineal wound where it is technically possible, include fascial-myocutaneous flaps, omentoplasty, tissue expanders, silicone breast implants and synthetic or biological prostheses [ Materials used in synthetic prostheses, such as polypropylene, create visceral adhesions in contact with the peritoneum and the pelvic floor organs that can cause erosions, fistulas, or perforations; for this reason, these meshes are not recommended in perineal wound reconstruction. On the other hand, biological prostheses, despite being more advantageous, have limitations related to low resistance and reduced integration into the tissue (ingrowth), the tendency of shrinking, high costs, the risk of rejection reactions or transmission of viral infections and the need of tissue tracking and preoperative soaking [ The use of biosynthetic prosthetic materials in recent years has revolutionized the pelvic–perineal reconstructive surgery, achieving satisfactory results. These prostheses have a chemical structure very similar to the natural polymers contained in biological tissues, such as collagen, which gives these materials excellent biocompatibility. The interaction between the three-dimensional matrix of the synthetic copolymers and human tissue promotes cell adhesion and cell growth. In some circumstances, the body “metabolizes” the polymer by degrading it over time until it is completely reabsorbed after tissue regeneration. This is the case of the GORE The aim of the current observational retrospective study is to analyse and compare the surgical and oncological outcomes in patients undergoing Miles’ APR and perineal wound reconstruction with or without the use of an absorbable biosynthetic prosthesis in two high-volume tertiary centres.

They are often seen in the setting of complicated perianal fistula but can also be seen as the precipitating cause of perianal fistula. Perianal abscess is a part of a wide group of anorectal abscesses, and is the most common type of it. They are mainly confined to the perianal region but if left untreated, can extend to involve the continuations of the perianal space. In the worst and most troublesome cases, these can also lead to systemic infections [ Common causes of perianal abscess include trauma, anal sex, diabetes mellitus, corticosteroid medications, immunosuppressive state, anal fissures and inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn's disease [ Patients commonly present with redness and swelling in the anal region often associated with throbbing pain, fever, tenderness, constipation and perianal discharge (in cases of fistulous tract formation). Males are more commonly affected as compared to females [ Early diagnosis of the condition is essential for timely intervention. Usually, clinical examination is sufficient to diagnose the presence of abscess as the cause of the patient’s symptoms. However, to accurately evaluate the location, extent and possible associated complications, further radiological investigation is often needed. Various imaging modalities have been tried for decades including CT pelvis and CT/Xray-fistulography, but did not prove to be of much use. Anorectal ultrasound is a useful modality for identification and characterization of perianal abscess; however, its use is often limited owing to extreme pain and tenderness suffered by the patient due to underlying abscess. Transcutaneous perineal ultrasonography using high-frequency linear transducer can be used to identify the location of abscess, measure its approximate volume and grossly assess its loco-regional extent, however, detailed analysis can still not be done [ Contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) is currently the gold standard for perianal disease with almost 100% accuracy when compared with post-surgical outcomes.

MRI has been shown to correlate with operative/clinical findings in 82 % of anorectal fistulas [ Although surgical treatment is mainstay of therapy, having a good understanding of the anatomy is vital [ Goal of surgical treatment for anal fistula is definitive treatment by closure, obliteration, or excision of the fistula tract, and the main priority is to avoid immediate fecal incontinence. While the fecal continence mechanism is complex, this loosely translates to a priority to preserve the external sphincter muscle across most approaches. The risk for post-operative anal sphincter dysfunction is typically when the anatomy is distorted, including recurrent or complex fistulas, previous anorectal surgeries, and female sex [ While treatment options available for any given situation may be many – seton placement, fistulotomy, fibrin glue injections, fistula plug, and advancement flaps – most surgeons have a few techniques they are comfortable with, and tailor these to the patient's situation and anatomy of the fistula. For submucosal or simple intersphincteric fistulas, treatment is fistulotomy and healing by secondary intention is typically associated with low recurrence and complications [ For deeper fistulas, involving the external sphincter muscle or having complexity like branching or extensive infection, the surgeon may opt for seton placement. A draining seton can provide symptomatic relief as well as decrease of inflammation, edema, or infection to allow for staged operative interventions.

Furthermore, sedatives are necessary for young children or patients with claustrophobia, and MRI requires gadolinium-based contrast agents, which are associated with a risk of complications, such as brain deposition or nephrotic systemic fibrosis. Transperineal ultrasonography (TPUS) is a simple, real-time, and practical examination that does not require specific patient preparation. Compared with pelvic MRI, TPUS has the advantages of being inexpensive, noninvasive, widely available, and safe [ This retrospective study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, which waived the requirement for informed consent (IRB No. B-2105-687-102). Between January 2013 and February 2020, 125 patients aged <19 years with Crohn's disease who underwent TPUS or pelvic MRI at the authors’ affiliated hospital were consecutively enrolled in this study. Among them, 56 were selected based on the availability of two or more pelvic MRI scans and TPUS examination reports. Twenty-seven patients were removed from consideration according to the following exclusion criteria: (1) a >14-day interval between each MRI and TPUS examination (n=22), (2) absence of perianal lesions (n=2), and (3) a >2-year interval between baseline and follow-up examinations (n=3). Finally, 29 patients were included in the analysis. The demographic data and information related to the treatment for PACD were collected from the electronic medical records. TPUS was performed without preparations such as enema administration or premedication by two experienced pediatric radiologists (J.Y.K. and Y.J.R. with 16 and 10 years of clinical experience, respectively).

The operating surgeons need to understand the exact position of the anal fistula and its relation to the anatomical structures in order to achieve high cure rate especially in complex anal fistulas. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard investigation used for anal fistulas. Usually, the MRI is interpreted by the radiologists who then send a written report to the operating surgeon and the surgeon performs the surgery after reading the radiologist’s report. Formats have been suggested for reporting the MRI in fistulas[ Format for the written magnetic resonance imaging report SJUH- St James’s University Hospital classification. Report: The primary fistula tract is opening in perianal skin at 7 o’clock position. It extends superiorly in right ischiorectal fossa from 7 to 8 o’clock position for a length of 6.35 cm and penetrates the external anal sphincter (EAS) at 8 o’clock position involving approximately two-thirds of the EAS. It then bends inferiorly and follows an intersphincteric route from 8 to 6 o’clock and opens in the anal canal at the level of dentate line. There are no secondary extensions of primary tract. There are no secondary tracts, no associated abscess, and no supralevator tract. The sphincters look normally preserved.

No secondary tract, abscess or supralevator extensions. Parks grade -II, SJUH grade III.  First, when only a written report is sent by the radiologist who has analyzed the MRI scans, then a lot of important information is lost. This happens because the three-dimensional picture created in the radiologist’s mind by the detailed visual analysis of the MRI scans cannot be replicated in the surgeon’s mind just by reading the text in the radiologist’s report. This loss of three-dimensional visual data can be prevented by sending a small video highlighting all relevant parameters along with the written report. Second, as discussed, the two main concerns in anal fistulas are recurrence and incontinence[ \n As the origin of most fistulas is at the level of the dentate line, the location of the internal opening in most of them is at that level only. The location of the internal opening does not accurately correspond to the amount of involvement of the EAS as penetration of the EAS by the fistula is often at a different level (Figure  The level of understanding of fistula anatomy is greatly enhanced in the surgeon’s mind when a small video of MRI scan showing the fistula characteristics is send along with the written report ( Format for reporting the fistula magnetic resonance imaging in the video As can be seen, the novel parameter reported in this study, HOPE (height of penetration of external an",

The role of sepsis in the intersphincteric space, the space between the internal and the external sphincters, has been known for several decades. Over the last few years, proper eradication of sepsis in the intersphincteric has been shown to improve success rates in complex fistulas. Conventionally, it is believed that in the sphincter complex (the internal and the external sphincters) there is only one potential space through which a fistula (pus/sepsis) extends. This is the space between the two sphincters (intersphincteric space) ( Schematic diagram showing intersphincteric and outer-sphincteric spaces. However, the recent availability of high-resolution MRI has enabled a detailed evaluation of complex anal fistulas and their relation to the sphincter complex. It seems that apart from the conventional intersphincteric space, there is another space lateral (outside) to this space, between the external sphincter and its external fascia (named as “outer-sphincteric space” in this manuscript) ( In a retrospective study, the MRI scans of patients operated on intersphincteric abscesses over a four-year period were studied. A team comprising of operating surgeons and the consulting radiologist assessed the MRI scans. Features analyzed included whether the external sphincter could be seen lateral to the intersphincteric abscess/tract or not, extension of the abscess/tract to the ischiorectal fossa or the supralevator space, and whether it was possible to drain or lay open the abscess into the rectum through the transanal route. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Indus International Hospital. Informed consent was taken from all the patients.

This can be preceded by neoadjuvant therapy such as chemoradiotherapy or adjuvant therapy with postoperative chemotherapy, considering multiple factors such as tumor size and location, clinical stage, and surgical procedure to be performed [ In the surgical management of RC with curative intent, the choice of surgical approach will depend on the tumor's height in relation to the anal margin (AM), the involvement of adjacent structures (levator ani muscles, seminal glands, and bladder), and the involvement of the anal sphincter complex. The main transabdominal surgical procedures used for the resection of RC, with subsequent primary anastomosis and sphincter preservation, are low anterior resection (LAR) with colorectal anastomosis for patients with tumors in the upper third of the rectum, and ultra-low anterior resection (ULAR) with coloanal anastomosis, with or without intersphincteric dissection, for patients with tumors in the middle or lower thirds of the rectum [ It is important to consider the potential postoperative adverse results that significantly increase morbidity and mortality in RC surgery procedures. Anastomotic leak (AL) is one of the most severe complications in patients undergoing RC surgery. The incidence of AL in this specific population ranges from 3% to 36.3% [ Multiple studies in the literature have identified numerous risk factors associated with the development of AL after colorectal surgery and can be divided into patient-, disease- and treatment-related factors. Identifying those risk factors for AL can help surgeons use a tailored approach for decision-making, but in the present day, it is not possible to predict the occurrence of leakage for a specific patient. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed cases of RC surgery performed at our hospital, examining the frequency of AL, and evaluated the clinical, surgical, and pathological characteristics to identify risk factors for AL in a surgical reference center in Mexico City.

It is characterized by an unknown etiology, difficult management, and frequent recurrence. In recent years, the global incidence of CD has increased steadily [ Perianal fistulizing Crohn’s disease (PFCD) is the most common and distinctive complication associated with CD. PFCD may develop in up to 43% of patients with CD [ Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely recognized as the gold standard for identifying various types of anal fistulas [ Given the correlation between the PFCD lesion region and surrounding tissues, the model must be equipped with adequate global feature extraction capabilities. Thus, Vision Transformer (ViT) [ Heat maps of anal fistula image visualization based on different recognition models As a result, ViT was combined with the MobileNet Convolutional neural network (CNN). This integration enables the model to capture both global and local features with increased precision in regions of interest. This paper introduces CVT-HNet fusion network, which utilizes high-resolution anal fistula MRI. By incorporating residual structures, depthwise separable convolution, and Coordinate Attention (CA) mechanism [ CVT-HNet fusion model, which integrates CNN and ViT architectures, is proposed for the accurate classification of PFCD and CAF based on high-resolution anal MRI. This work represents an early attempt to apply hybrid networks to this specific clinical task. CVT-HNet employs a customized MV2-CA module with h-swish activation to enhance non-linearity without compromising computational efficiency. By interleaving MV2-CA and Transformer layers, CVT-HNet effectively fuses local and global features for precise detection of subtle anal fistula variations in MRI scans. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated through comparative experiments and external validation. These assessments involve comparisons with both original Transformer models and hybrid networks. The contribution of each component module of CVT-HNet is evaluated through ablation experiments. Heat maps are used to assess the variations in network attention within anal fistula images across different models. CNNs have been widely used in medical image classification for their effective local feature extraction. Recent studies include Balasubramaniam et al. [ Despite these advances, CNNs’ local receptive fields limit their capacity to model global context, particularly affecting performance on lesions with blurred boundaries or variable morphology where long-range dependencies are essential. ViT architecture leverages self-attention to model global dependencies, showing unique advantages in complex structural recognition. In 2023, Zhang et al.

It accounts for approximately 5% of all anorectal fistulas,  This retrospective cohort study included patients who underwent RVF surgery at Shahid Faghihi Hospital, a tertiary referral colorectal center (Shiraz, Iran), between 2013 and 2023. The exclusion criteria were active malignancy, inflammatory bowel diseases, a lack of routine postoperative follow-up, and other types of surgical techniques. All surgeries were performed by a single expert colorectal surgeon. Postoperative follow-ups were routinely scheduled at 3, 6, and 12 months, with annual visits thereafter. Each visit included a comprehensive medical history, physical examination, and imaging studies as needed. Fistula recurrence was defined as the passage of gas, feces, or mucosal discharge from the vagina postoperatively. If the patient’s history and physical examination did not confirm recurrence, CT or MRI with rectal contrast was performed. We collected demographic information, past medical history, the site, size, and cause of the fistula, the status of the anal sphincter, the operation time, the duration of hospital stay, previous surgeries for fistula repair, and ostomy status from medical records. Additionally, postoperative complications were recorded using the Clavien-Dindo classification.  Prior to data collection, written informed consent was obtained from the patients. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (code: IR.SUMS.REC.1403.149). Complete mechanical bowel preparation was performed prior to the surgery. A single dose of prophylactic antibiotics was administered preoperatively, and a Foley catheter was inserted. Following the induction of general or spinal anesthesia, the patient was positioned in the lithotomy position. A transverse perineal incision was placed.

The standard surgical procedures in the management of perianal fistula include seton placement and fistulectomy[ Long-standing CD carries a significant risk of cancer development, particularly squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Patients with CD have a 4- to 20-fold increased risk of colorectal carcinoma[ MRI demonstrates utility not only for evaluation of fistulizing disease, but also in the diagnosis of perianal carcinoma. Characteristic MRI findings suggestive of perianal neoplasia in patients include irregular inner wall morphology, delayed enhancement of internal tissue, and mucinous patterns. While the fistula wall is frequently observed, this finding alone is insufficient to differentiate cancer from inflammation. Additionally, a distinct double-layered enhancement pattern characterized by an early bright external wall enhancement contrasting with a darker delayed-enhancing internal wall may be observed[ Perianal fistulas in CD, which can affect the small and large intestines, are characterized by narrow squamous epithelial cells. These cells undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition to become transition cells in response to immunological triggers or bacterial invasion. As a result, the cells lose their phenotypic and functional properties such as polarity and adhesiveness, while acquiring mesenchymal cell traits. This leads to reduced cell-to-cell adhesion and enhanced migratory activity[ \n Immunohistochemical analyses of CD-related perianal fistulas indicate acute inflammation in 56% of cases[ Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play crucial roles in tissue degradation and remodeling.

    "findings_text": "Crohn’s disease (CD) can present with a range of clinical manifestations, including the development of anal fistulas or perianal abscesses. Perianal abscesses typically occur during infancy and often resolve by the age of one year. However, pediatricians should remain vigilant for the possibility of CD when perianal abscesses present outside the usual age range. Diagnosing CD as the underlying cause of anal fistulas typically requires gastrointestinal endoscopy. However, characteristic findings of CD, such as longitudinal ulcers or cobblestone patterns, may not always be evident on endoscopy [ Treatment of perianal abscesses and fistulas associated with CD often involves antibiotics, biological therapies, and surgical interventions such as seton drainage. While the efficacy of enteral nutritional therapy for perianal fistulas has not been firmly established, there are reports suggesting its potential benefits. Here, we report the case of a pediatric patient with a refractory anal fistula that led to a diagnosis of CD despite the absence of abnormal endoscopic findings. Notably, in this case, the refractory anal fistula was successfully treated with partial enteral nutrition (PEN) therapy alone, and remission has been maintained for over 1.5 years. A three-year-old boy presented with redness, swelling, and pain in his buttocks, followed by drainage, and was referred to the pediatric surgery department of our hospital with suspected perianal fistulas, three weeks after the onset of anal symptoms. At presentation, he had neither gastrointestinal symptoms nor growth failure. Additionally, he had no family history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or immunodeficiency. Physical examination revealed a reddish mass, approximately 3 cm in size, at the 3 o’clock position of the anus, and an induration of approximately 1 cm at the 9 o’clock position. The pain was more severe at the 3 o’clock position, prompting us to incise and drain the lesion. Blood examination revealed the following results: WBC count of 10,600/µL (neutrophils 44%, lymphocytes 52%), hemoglobin 13.0 g/dL, platelet count of 34.7 × 10⁴/µL, albumin 4.5 g/dL, and CRP ≤0.01 mg/dL. Stool examinations revealed occult blood at 880 ng/mL (+) and calprotectin at 65.2 mg/kg (Table  A blood examination revealed no abnormal findings.

    "findings_text": "Crohn’s disease (CD) is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory condition associated with significant complications due to persistent inflammation, leading to increased risks of comorbidity, hospitalization, surgery, and disability, all of which profoundly impact patients’ mental health and quality of life.

A 74‐year‐old man with a permanent stoma, who had undergone colectomy for descending colon cancer 20 years ago, presented with dysuria and was found to have a prostate‐specific antigen level of 120.24 ng/mL in screening tests.

Treatment strategies for advanced rectal cancer have differed significantly between Western countries and Japan [ Although LLND, a technically demanding procedure, has traditionally been performed using open surgery, the increasing popularity of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has led to its recent application in LLND. Retrospective reports from advanced facilities have indicated favourable outcomes regarding the safety and curative potential of MIS‐LLND [ This was a multicentre prospective observational study conducted at six facilities affiliated with the Multicentre Clinical Study Group of Osaka, Colorectal Cancer Treatment Group. The inclusion criteria were as follows: patients diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the rectum via endoscopic biopsy of the rectal primary lesion, with the lower edge of the tumour located between the peritoneal reflection and the anal verge, cStage II or III (evaluation based on pretreatment findings for patients who underwent preoperative treatment), absence of lateral lymph node metastasis with a short‐axis diameter of ≥10 mm on CT and MRI, aged between 20 and 80 years, and scheduled for laparoscopic LLND. The exclusion criteria were active multiple cancers and lack of decision‐making capacity. Similar to the JCOG0212 trial [ The registered patients underwent bilateral laparoscopic LLND. The clearance range for LLND included the lymph nodes around the internal iliac artery and the obturator lymph nodes, while the autonomic nerves were generally preserved. Registration was allowed only for cases wherein LLND was performed laparoscopically, regardless of whether TME was performed laparoscopically or robotically. To assess patient safety, the primary outcome was the incidence of Grade III–IV postoperative complications at discharge according to the Clavien–Dindo classification [ The criteria for early urinary dysfunction were established based on the definitions used in the JCOG0212 trial [ Facility requirements for quality control included experience with MIS‐LLND in ≥10 cases or at least 20 lateral pelvic compartments.
