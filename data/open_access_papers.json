      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nThere is no validated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) index for assessment of perianal fistulas in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). We developed and internally validated a new instrument.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe used paired baseline and week 24 MRI scans from 160 participants in a randomized placebo-controlled trial of stem cell therapy for patients with perianal fistulizing CD. Four radiologists scored disease activity using index items identified during previous studies and exploratory items. Reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients. We developed an index using backward elimination linear regression analysis in which potential independent variables were items having intraclass correlation coefficients of at least 0.4 and the dependent variable was perianal fistulizing disease activity, measured on a 100 mm visual analogue scale. The final model was internally validated using the .632 bootstrap method to correct model optimism and quantify calibration accuracy. We evaluated responsiveness of the index by assessing longitudinal validity and estimating standardized effect sizes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe developed the magnetic resonance novel index for fistula imaging in CD (MAGNIFI-CD) using 6 items. The optimism-corrected R2 of the model was 0.71, which was comparable to R2 for the original sample (0.74). The calibration slope for the model was 0.98. Compared with the original and modified versions of the Van Assche index, the MAGNIFI-CD had improved operating characteristics. Estimates of intraclass correlation coefficients for MAGNIFI-CD, the modified Van Assche index, and Van Assche index were 0.85 (95% CI, 0.77-0.90), 0.81 (95% CI, 0.74-0.86), and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.71-0.86) for intra-rater reliability, and 0.74 (95% CI,0.63-0.80), 0.67 (95% CI, 0.55-0.75), and 0.68 (95% CI, 0.56-0.77) for inter-rater reliability. Corresponding standardized effect size estimates were 1.02 (95% CI, 0.65-1.39), 0.84 (95% CI, 0.48-1.21), and 0.68 (95% CI, 0.33-1.03).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe developed an index, called the MAGNIFI-CD, based on 6 items. It assesses MRI data and determines perianal fistulizing CD activity with improved operating characteristics compared to previous indices. This index may be used as an outcome measure in clinical trials comparing treatment effects in patients with perianal fistulizing CD. Although the performance of the MAGNIFI-CD indicates its stability and reasonable external validity, external validation is needed.",

      "abstract": "Clinical and radiologic variables associated with perianal fistula (PAF) outcomes are poorly understood. We developed prediction models for anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) treatment failure in patients with Crohn's disease-related PAF. In a multicenter retrospective study between 2005 and 2022 we included biologic-naive adults (>17 years) who initiated their first anti-TNF therapy for PAF after pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Pretreatment MRI studies were prospectively reread centrally by blinded radiologists. We developed and internally validated a prediction model based on clinical and radiologic parameters to predict the likelihood of anti-TNF treatment failure, clinically, at 6 months. We compared our model and a simplified version of MRI parameters alone with existing imaging-based PAF activity indices (MAGNIFI-CD and modified Van Assche MRI scores) by De Long statistical test. We included 221 patients: 32 ± 14 years, 60% males, 76% complex fistulas; 68% treated with infliximab and 32% treated with adalimumab. Treatment failure occurred in 102 (46%) patients. Our prediction model included age at PAF diagnosis, time to initiate anti-TNF treatment, and smoking and 8 MRI characteristics (supra/extrasphincteric anatomy, fistula length >4.3 cm, primary tracts >1, secondary tracts >1, external openings >1, tract hyperintensity on T1-weighted imaging, horseshoe anatomy, and collections >1.3 cm). Our full and simplified MRI models had fair discriminatory capacity for anti-TNF treatment failure (concordance statistic, 0.67 and 0.65, respectively) and outperformed MAGNIFI-CD (P = .002 and < .0005) and modified Van Assche MRI scores (P < .0001 and < .0001), respectively.

The primary objective was to identify all available scoring indices and describe the operating properties of these indices.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFifty-three studies reported on the use of one clinical index (Perianal Disease Activity Index: PDAI), three PROMs and ten radiological indices. Twenty-five studies evaluated the operating properties of these indices. The PDAI demonstrated content validity, construct validity and responsiveness but criterion validity or reliability were not assessed. The Van Assche index (VAI), modified VAI and the Magnetic Resonance Index for Assessing Fistulas in Patients with CD (MAGNIFI-CD) were the most studied radiological indices. These indices demonstrated responsiveness and reliability. The VAI and MAGNIFI-CD demonstrated construct validity. Criterion and content validity and feasibility have not been assessed. Among the three PROMs, the Crohn's Anal Fistula Quality of Life index demonstrated content and construct validity, inter-observer reliability and responsiveness. Criterion validity, intra-observer reliability and feasibility have not been assessed for this index.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere are no fully valid, reliable, and responsive clinical disease or radiological indices for PFCD. Although the radiological indices demonstrated responsiveness and reliability, well-defined cut-offs for response and remission are lacking.

We investigated MRI features of PAF and associations with long-term outcomes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe retrospectively analyzed 243 patients with pelvic MRI for diagnosis of CD. Incidence of clinically evident PAF at diagnosis was determined, as were the proportions of patients with clinical failure (failure to achieve fistula healing within 1 year) and recurrence (new/recurrent PAF after fistula healing within 1 year). Associations between outcomes and MRI features, specified in modified Van Assche index and MAGNIFI-CD, were evaluated. Associations between later development of clinically evident PAF and subclinical PAF detected on MRI at diagnosis were evaluated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong 243 included patients, 108 (44.4%) and 76 (31.3%) had clinically evident and subclinical PAF at diagnosis, respectively. 66.4% of the patients with clinically evident PAF achieved fistula healing within 1 year, and 32.7% of those patients developed recurrence. Fistula length and dominant features of the tracts were associated with clinical failure, and fistula length was associated with recurrence. Clinically evident PAF developed in 17.0% of the patients without clinically evident PAF at diagnosis. We did not find statistically significant association between subclinical PAF and later development of clinically evident PAF (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.438; P=.15).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA considerable proportion of Korean pediatric CD patients had clinically evident and subclinical PAF.

A validated imaging assessment tool for quantification of perianal disease severity and activity is needed to evaluate treatment response. We aimed to identify magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based measures of perianal fistulizing disease activity and study design features appropriate for pediatric patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSeventy-nine statements relevant to MRI-based assessment of pediatric perianal fistulizing CD activity and clinical trial design were generated from literature review and expert opinion. Statement appropriateness was rated by a panel (N = 15) of gastroenterologists, radiologists, and surgeons using modified RAND/University of California Los Angeles appropriateness methodology.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe modified Van Assche Index (mVAI) and the Magnetic Resonance Novel Index for Fistula Imaging in CD (MAGNIFI-CD) were considered appropriate instruments for use in pediatric perianal fistulizing disease clinical trials. Although there was concern regarding the use of intravascular contrast material in pediatric patients, its use in clinical trials was considered appropriate. A clinically evident fistula tract and radiologic disease defined as at least 1 fistula or abscess on pelvic MRI were considered appropriate trial inclusion criteria. A coprimary clinical and radiologic end point and inclusion of a patient-reported outcome were also considered appropriate.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOutcomes of treatment of perianal fistulizing disease in children must include MRI.

      "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for assessment of perianal fistulising Crohn's disease (CD). The Van Assche index is the most commonly used MRI fistula index. To assess the reliability of the Van Assche index, and to modify the instrument to improve reliability and create a novel index for fistulising CD. A consensus process developed scoring conventions for existing Van Assche index component items and new items. Four experienced radiologists evaluated 50 MRI images in random order on three occasions. Reliability was assessed by estimates of intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Common sources of disagreement were identified and recommendations made to minimise disagreement. A mixed effects model used a 100 mm visual anologue scale (VAS) for global severity as outcome and component items as predictors to create a modified Van Assche index. Intraclass correlation coefficients (95% confidence intervals) for intra-rater reliability of the original and modified Van Assche indices and the VAS were 0.86 (0.81-0.90), 0.90 (0.86-0.93) and 0.86 (0.82-0.89). Corresponding ICCs for inter-rater reliability were 0.66 (0.52-0.76), 0.67 (0.55-0.75) and 0.58 (0.47-0.66). Sources of disagreement included number, location, and extension of fistula tracts, and rectal wall involvement. A modified Van Assche index (range 0-24) was created that included seven component items. Although \"almost perfect\" intra-rater reliability was observed for the assessment of MRI images for fistulising CD using the Van Assche index, inter-rater reliability was considerably lower.

      "abstract": "Fistulizing perianal disease is a frequent, chronic, and often debilitating manifestation of Crohn disease (CD) in adults and children, which in the past was relatively refractory to treatment. The advent of biologic agents such as anti-tumor necrosis factor-α and cellular therapies, used in conjunction with a range of surgical interventions, has greatly improved disease outcomes, although complete remission can still be elusive. This review considers current perianal imaging options, specifically pelvic MRI and endoanal and transperineal ultrasound, and their roles in diagnosis, management, and assessment of treatment response. Pelvic MRI is the first line technique for imaging of perianal CD given the complexity of fistulas encountered in CD. MRI technical acquisition parameters for adults and children and an approach to MRI interpretation and reporting are provided. Anatomic classification systems for fistulising perianal disease are presented. We also explore the history, current landscape, and future developments of MRI features of perianal disease as imaging biomarkers to quantify activity and severity, and consider CD MRI-based inflammatory activity scores. We discuss the reliability and validation of a number of indices (including PEMPAC, MAGNIFI-CD, mVAI, and Van Assche Index), their potential to quantify treatment response, and possible prognostic capabilities.",

The site radiologist and 2 central radiologists provided a radiologist global assessment (RGA) on a 100 mm visual analog scale and scored the items selected by a Delphi group of 35 international radiologists and a review of the literature. Two weighted multivariable statistical models were constructed against the RGA.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEighty children underwent 95 pelvic magnetic resonance imaging scans; 64 were used for derivation and 31 for validation. The following items were included: fistula number, location, length and T2 hyperintensity; abscesses; rectal wall involvement; and fistula branching. The last 2 items had negative beta scores and thus were excluded in a contending basic model. In the validation cohort, the full and the basic models had the same strong correlation with the RGA (r = 0.75; P < 0.01) and with the adult Van Assche index (VAI; r = 0.93 and 0.92; P < 0.001). The correlation of the VAI with the RGA was similar (r = 0.77; P < 0.01). The 2 models and the VAI had a similar ability to differentiate remission from active disease (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.91-0.94). The PEMPAC index had good responsiveness to change (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.69-1.00).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nUsing a blended judgmental and mathematical approach, we developed and validated an index for quantifying the severity of perianal disease in children with CD.

      "abstract": "<h4>Background and aims</h4>To improve management of patients with Crohn's disease, objective measurements of disease activity are needed. Ileocolonoscopy is the current reference standard but has limitations that restrict repeated use. Ultrasonography is potentially useful for activity monitoring, but no validated sonographic activity index is currently in widespread use. Thus, we aimed to construct and validate a simple ultrasound score for Crohn's disease.<h4>Methods</h4>Forty patients were prospectively examined with ultrasound and endoscopy in the development phase. The Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease [SES-CD] was used as a reference standard. Seven ultrasound variables [bowel wall thickness, length, colour Doppler, stenosis, fistula, stratification and fatty wrapping] were initially included, and multiple linear regression was used to select the variables that should be included in the final score. Second, the ultrasound data from each patient were re-examined for interobserver assessment using weighted kappa and intraclass correlation. Finally, the activity index was validated in a new cohort of 124 patients.<h4>Results</h4>Length, fistula and stenosis were excluded. The combination of the remaining variables provided a multiple correlation coefficient of r = 0.78. Interobserver analysis revealed poor agreement for stratification and fatty wrapping and these were thus excluded. There was excellent interobserver agreement for the remaining score consisting of wall thickness and colour Doppler. In both patient cohorts, the ultrasound score correlated well with SES-CD [Development cohort: rho = 0.83, p < 0.001, Validation cohort: rho = 0.78, p < 0.001]. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed an area under the curve of 0.92 and 0.88 for detecting endoscopic activity and moderate endoscopic activity, respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A simple ultrasound activity index for Crohn's disease consisting of bowel wall thickness and colour Doppler was constructed and validated and correlated well with endoscopic disease activity.ClinicalTrials. gov ID: NCT03481751.",

      "abstract": "IBDs are chronic destructive disorders that negatively affect the functional status of patients. Recently, the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Disability Index (IBD-DI) was developed according to standard WHO processes. The aims of the current study were to validate the IBD-DI in an independent patient cohort, to develop an index-specific scoring system and to describe the disability status of a well-defined population-based cohort of French patients with IBD. From February 2012 to March 2014, the IBD-DI questionnaire was administered to a random sample of adult patients with an established diagnosis of IBD issued from a French population-based registry. The IBD-DI consists of 28 items that evaluate the four domains of body functions, activity participation, body structures and environmental factors. Validation included item reduction and data structure, construct validity, internal consistency, interobserver and intraobserver reliability evaluations. 150 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and 50 patients with UC completed the IBD-DI validation phase. The intraclass correlation coefficient for interobserver reliability was 0.91 and 0.54 for intraobserver reliability. Cronbach's α of internal consistency was 0.86. IBD-DI scores varied from 0 to 100 with a mean of 35.3 (Q1=19.6; Q3=51.8). IBD-DI scores were highly correlated with Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (-0.82; p<0.001) and SF-36 (-0.61; p<0.05) scores. Female gender (p<0.001), clinical disease activity (p<0.0001) and disease duration (p=0.02) were associated with higher IBD-DI scores. The IBD-DI has been validated for use in clinical trials and epidemiological studies. The IBD-DI showed high internal consistency, interobserver reliability and construct validity, and a moderate intraobserver reliability. It comprises 14 questions and ranges from 0 to 100. The mean IBD-DI score was 35.3 and was associated with gender, clinical disease activity and disease duration. Further research is needed to confirm the structural validity and to assess the responsiveness of IBD-DI. 2011-A00877-34.",

      "abstract": "Background: Bone marrow lesions (BMLs) and synovitis on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are associated with symptoms and predict degeneration of articular cartilage in osteoarthritis (OA). Validated methods for their semiquantitative assessment on MRI are available, but they all have similar scoring designs and questionable sensitivity to change. New scoring methods with completely different designs need to be developed and compared to existing methods. Objectives: To compare the performance of new web-based versions of the Knee Inflammation MRI Scoring System (KIMRISS) with the MRI OA Knee Score (MOAKS) for quantification of BMLs and synovitis-effusion (S-E). Design: Retrospective follow-up cohort. Methods: We designed web-based overlays outlining regions in the knee that are scored for BML in MOAKS and KIMRISS. For KIMRISS, both BML and S-E are scored on consecutive sagittal slices. The performance of these methods was compared in an international reading exercise of 8 readers evaluating 60 pairs of scans conducted 1 year apart from cases recruited to the OA Initiative (OAI) cohort. Interobserver reliability for baseline status and baseline to 1 year change in BML and S-E was assessed by intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and smallest detectable change (SDC). Feasibility was assessed using the System Usability Scale (SUS). Results: Mean change in BML and S-E was minimal over 1 year. Pre-specified targets for acceptable reliability (ICC ⩾ 0.80 and ⩾ 0.70 for status and change scores, respectively) were achieved more frequently for KIMRISS for both BML and synovitis. Mean (95% CI) ICC for change in BML was 0.88 (0.83–0.92) and 0.69 (0.60–0.78) for KIMRISS and MOAKS, respectively. KIMRISS mean SUS usability score was 85.7 and at the 95th centile of ranking for usability versus a score of 55.4 and 20th centile for MOAKS. Conclusion: KIMRISS had superior performance metrics to MOAKS for quantification of BML and S-E. Both methods should be further compared in trials of new therapies for OA.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Intestinal ultrasound (IUS) is a non-invasive tool for monitoring Crohn’s disease (CD) activity. Recently, sonographic activity scores, including the International Bowel Ultrasound Segmental Activity Score (IBUS-SAS) and Simple Ultrasound Activity Score for CD (SUS-CD), were developed. This study aimed to assess their clinical application value. Methods This retrospective study enrolled patients with CD from March 2021 to June 2022. The diagnostic performance of the ultrasound scores was evaluated using the simplified endoscopic score for CD (SES-CD). Correlations of ultrasound scores with SES-CD, CD activity index (CDAI), and inflammatory biomarkers were assessed. Inter-rater reliability was compared. Results In total, 140 patients were included. The IBUS-SAS for evaluating disease activity had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.895, sensitivity of 85.4%, and specificity of 82.4% for the cut-off value of 48.7. The SUS-CD revealed an AUC of 0.835, sensitivity of 92.7%, and specificity of 64.7% for the cut-off value of 2.5. The IBUS-SAS and SUS-CD were positively correlated with SES-CD (r = 0.511 and 0.534, respectively). The scores correlated significantly with the CDAI and inflammatory biomarkers (all p < 0.01). The IBUS-SAS was more strongly correlated with CDAI (r = 0.666 vs 0.486) and C-reactive protein (r = 0.645 vs 0.434) than the SUS-CD. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of the IBUS-SAS and SUS-CD between the two sonologists was excellent (ICC = 0.96 and 0.78, respectively). Conclusion Both the IBUS-SAS and SUS-CD can evaluate disease activity in CD and exhibited a significant correlation with activity indices and inflammatory biomarkers.

      "abstract": "Objective To show that for the MRI workup of non-specific low back pain and/or lumbar radiculopathy, the acquisition of T1-weighted sequences in the sagittal plane could be waived when using an FSE T2-weighted Dixon sequence. Materials and methods Three musculoskeletal radiologists retrospectively reviewed fifty lumbar spine MRI examinations performed for non-specific low back pain and/or lumbar radiculopathy. Two protocols were separately analyzed in the sagittal plane: a standard protocol (T1-weighted, in-phase, and water-only images of an FSE T2-weighted Dixon sequence) and a simplified protocol (fat-only, in-phase, and water-only images of an FSE T2-weighted Dixon sequence). Eight items usually assessed on T1-weighted sequences were analyzed for each of the vertebrae ( n  = 250), vertebral endplates ( n  = 500), vertebral corners ( n  = 1000), foramina ( n  = 500), lamina ( n  = 500), and facet joints ( n  = 500). Interchangeability of these protocols was tested using the individual equivalence index. A decrease in interobserver agreement of ≥ 5% when one reader used the simplified protocol compared with when both readers used the standard protocol was considered clinically significant. Interreader and intrareader agreement were assessed using kappa statistics. Rates of findings with each protocol were compared using odd ratios. Results The standard and simplified protocols were interchangeable (range of upper bound of the 95%CI of individual equivalence index = 0.25 to 1.38%). Intraprotocol and interprotocol interreader kappa values were similar (0.253–0.671 vs. 0.236–0.723, respectively). Rates of findings were not statistically significantly different ( p  ≥ 0.074), or were higher with the simplified protocol ( p  ≤ 0.036). Conclusion In our target population, a single sagittal T2-weighted Dixon sequence may replace the recommended combination of T1-, T2-, and fat-suppressed T2-weighted sequences. Key Points • In patients with non-specific low back pain or lumbar radiculopathy, spine MRI in the sagittal plane could be limited to a single FSE T2-weighted Dixon sequence, hereby reducing the acquisition time. • A simplified protocol of spine MRI in the sagittal plane combining FSE T2-weighted Dixon sequence provides the same information as a standard protocol including T1-, T2-, and fat-suppressed T2-weighted sequences for the workup of degenerative lumbar spine lesions. • For some findings shown on the simplified protocol, such as focal bone marrow replacement lesions or signs of infection, additional sequences including pre- and post-contrast T1-weighted sequences may be required, as is currently the case when using the standard protocol.",

Subjects with known or suspected CD were prospectively recruited between December 2011 and August 2014. Each patient underwent MRI and ileocolonoscopy with terminal ileum biopsies. Four MRI scoring systems (Magnetic Resonance Index of Activity [MaRIA], Clermont score, London score, and Crohn disease MRI Index) and component features were applied by two observers and correlated to the Crohn disease endoscopic index of severity (CDEIS, 0-44) and histopathologic endoscopic acute inflammation score (0-6). Interobserver agreement (weighted kappa and intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]) and diagnostic accuracy for active and ulcerating endoscopic or histopathologic disease were evaluated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNinety-eight patients (median age, 32 years old; 55 women, 43 men) were included. All four scoring systems showed good interobserver agreement (ICC = 0.70-0.78), moderate-to-strong correlation to CDEIS (r = 0.57-0.67) and weak-to-moderate correlation to endoscopic acute inflammation score (r = 0.38-0.49). Scoring systems' diagnostic accuracy for active and ulcerating endoscopic disease ranged from 73% to 78% and 71% to 76%, respectively, whereas for active histopathologic disease accuracy ranged from 65% to 72%. Between the scoring systems, no significant differences were found for both observers regarding interobserver agreement, correlation coefficients, and diagnostic accuracy.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAll scoring systems were comparable in terms of interobserver agreement, correlation to the endoscopic and histopathologic reference standard, and diagnostic accuracy.

This study investigates whether segmentation software could provide precise and reproducible objective measurements of fistula volume. Methods: Retrospective analysis of patients with perianal Crohn’s fistula at our institution between 2007 and 2013. Pre- and post-biologic MRI scans were used with varying time intervals. A total of two radiologists recorded fistula volumes, mean signal intensity and time taken to measure fistula volumes using validated Open Source segmentation software. A total of three radiologists assessed fistula response to treatment (improved, worse or unchanged) by comparing MRI scans. Results: A total of 18 cases were reviewed for this pilot study. Inter-observer variability was very good for volume and mean signal intensity; intra-class correlation (ICC) 0.95 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91–0.98] and 0.95 (95% CI 0.90–0.97) respectively. Intra-observer variability was very good for volume and mean signal intensity; ICC 0.99 (95% CI 0.97–0.99) and 0.98 (95% CI 0.95–0.99) respectively. Average time taken to measure fistula volume was 202 s and 250 s for readers 1 and 2. Agreement between three specialist radiologists was good [kappa 0.69 (95% CI 0.49–0.90)] for the subjective assessment of fistula response. Significant association was found between objective percentage volume change and subjective consensus agreement of response (p = 0.001). Median volume change for improved, stable or worsening fistula response was −67% [interquartile range (IQR): −78, −47], 0% (IQR: −16, +17), and +487% (IQR: +217, +559) respectively.

Currently, data on postoperative MRI findings are scarce, although they are considered important for assessing healing and recurrence. Our aim, therefore, was to evaluate fistula characteristics on MRI and their relationship with clinical outcomes after LIFT.<h4>Method</h4>Consecutive Crohn's patients treated with LIFT between 2007 and 2018 who underwent baseline and follow-up MRI were retrospectively included. MRIs were scored by two radiologists according to characteristics based on the original and modified Van Assche indices. MRI findings, with emphasis on fibrosis, and the relationship with clinical healing, re-interventions and recurrences are described.<h4>Results</h4>Twelve patients were included [four men, median age 34 (interquartile range 28-39) years]. Follow-up MRI was performed at a median of 5.5 months (interquartile range 2.5-6.0) after LIFT. At baseline, all patients showed a tract with predominantly granulation tissue, which changed to predominantly fibrotic in seven (in three of whom it was completely fibrotic). All patients with a (predominantly) fibrotic tract had clinical closure and no re-interventions or recurrences during long-term follow-up. In contrast, of the five patients with persisting granulation tissue, two reached clinical healing, two needed re-intervention and one had a recurrence.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Markedly decreased fistula activity can be observed on MRI after LIFT. The majority of patients develop a predominantly fibrotic tract relatively soon after LIFT without clinical recurrence, suggesting a highly effective therapy. Unfavourable clinical outcomes were only present in patients with persisting granulation tissue, indicating the potential prognostic value of MRI.",

We assessed inter- and intra-observer agreement of small bowel motility as part of a prospective multicentre trial investigating whether mMRI can predict longer-term response to biologic therapy in active, non-stricturing SB-CD (MOTILITY Trial).<h4>Methods</h4>297 segmental small bowel motility scores from 104 SBCD patients (mean age 38.9 years, 43 female) recruited to the MOTILITY trial were measured independently by two radiologists experienced in mMRI, using GIQuant software. Twenty-six datasets were re-read by both radiologists to test intra-observer variability after a washout period of at least 6 weeks. Five gastrointestinal radiologists inexperienced in mMRI derived 66 segmental motility scores from the same 30 randomly selected patients.

Purpose To assess the reliability of MR enterography features to describe Crohn disease strictures and determine correlation with stricture severity. Materials and Methods A retrospective study of patients with symptomatic terminal ileal Crohn disease strictures who underwent MR enterography at tertiary care centers (Cleveland Clinic: September 2013 to November 2020; Mayo Clinic: February 2008 to March 2019) was conducted by using convenience sampling. In the development phase, blinded and trained radiologists independently evaluated 26 MR enterography features from baseline and follow-up examinations performed more than 6 months apart, with no bowel resection performed between examinations. Follow-up examinations closest to 12 months after baseline were selected. Reliability was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). In the validation phase, after five features were redefined, reliability was re-estimated in an independent convenience sample using baseline examinations. Multivariable linear regression analysis identified features with at least moderate interrater reliability (ICC ≥0.41) that were independently associated with stricture severity. Results Ninety-nine (mean age, 40 years ± 14 [SD]; 50 male) patients were included in the development group and 51 (mean age, 45 years ± 16 [SD]; 35 female) patients were included in the validation group. In the development group, nine features had at least moderate interrater reliability. One additional feature demonstrated moderate reliability in the validation group. Stricture length (ICC = 0.85 [95% CI: 0.75, 0.91] and 0.91 [95% CI: 0.75, 0.96] in development and validation phase, respectively) and maximal associated small bowel dilation (ICC = 0.74 [95% CI: 0.63, 0.80] and 0.73 [95% CI: 0.58, 0.87] in development and validation group, respectively) had the highest interrater reliability. Stricture length, maximal stricture wall thickness, and maximal associated small bowel dilation were independently (regression coefficients, 0.09-3.97; P < .001) associated with stricture severity. Conclusion MR enterography definitions and scoring conventions for reliably assessing features of Crohn disease strictures were developed and validated, and feature correlation with stricture severity was determined. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

      "abstract": "Background Standardized methods to measure and describe Crohn disease strictures at CT enterography are needed to guide clinical decision making and for use in therapeutic studies. Purpose To assess the reliability of CT enterography features to describe Crohn disease strictures and their correlation with stricture severity. Materials and Methods A retrospective study was conducted in 43 adult patients with symptomatic terminal ileal Crohn disease strictures who underwent standard-of-care CT enterography at a tertiary care center at the Cleveland Clinic between January 2008 and August 2016. After training on standardized definitions, four abdominal radiologists blinded to all patient information assessed imaging features (seven continuous measurements and nine observations) of the most distal ileal stricture in two separate sessions (separated by ≥2 weeks) in random order. Features with an interrater intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.41 or greater (ie, moderate reliability or better) were considered reliable. Univariable and multivariable linear regression analysis identified reliable features associated with a visual analog scale of overall stricture severity. Significant reliable features were assessed as components of a CT enterography-based model to quantitate stricture severity. Results Examinations in 43 patients (mean age, 52 years ± 16 [SD]; 23 female) were evaluated. Five continuous measurements and six observations demonstrated at least moderate interrater reliability (interrater ICC range, 0.42 [95% CI: 0.25, 0.57] to 0.80 [95% CI: 0.67, 0.88]). Of these, 10 were univariably associated with stricture severity, and three continuous measurements-stricture length (interrater ICC, 0.64 [95% CI: 0.42, 0.81]), maximal associated small bowel dilation (interrater ICC, 0.80 [95% CI: 0.67, 0.88]), and maximal stricture wall thickness (interrater ICC, 0.50 [95% CI: 0.34, 0.62])-were independently associated (P value range, <.001 to .003) with stricture severity in a multivariable model. These three measurements were used to derive a well-calibrated (optimism-adjusted calibration slope = 1.00) quantitative model of stricture severity. Conclusion Standardized CT enterography measurements and observations can reliably describe terminal ileal Crohn disease strictures. Stricture length, maximal associated small bowel dilation, and maximal stricture wall thickness are correlated with stricture severity. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

Capsule study was viewed and the different indices were independently scored by two trained paediatric gastroenterologists. The relationship between pre-existing scores and CE-CD was assessed by linear regression analysis. Clinical outcomes prediction assessment was based on receiver operating characteristics curves, survival analysis and Cox regression. Finally, interobserver agreement was measured.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFifty-nine patients were finally included. CE-CD showed a strong positive correlation with the Lewis score (ρ = 0.947) and the Capsule Endoscopy Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CECDAI) (ρ = 0.982). Both CE-CD and CECDAI were significant predictors of treatment escalation (hazard ratio 1.07 and 1.09, respectively, with both p-values < 0.01). However, no score predicted risk of hospital admission, surgery or clinical/endoscopic relapse. The presence of moderate-to-severe small bowel (SB) inflammation, defined as a score of ≥9 on CE-CD, provided a hazard ratio of treatment escalation of 2.6 (95% confidence interval: 1.3-5.3). This cut-off provided the optimal sensitivity/specificity pair: 48.4%/89.3%. No interobserver misclassification among inflammation categories given by CE-CD were observed (kappa 100%).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCE-CD is a useful tool to document SB inflammation in children with CD. It correlates strongly with classical scores, can better predict need for treatment escalation and shows good interobserver agreement.",

Although MRI is widely used for ankle assessment, no validated system exists for classifying normal morphological variation of the peroneus brevis tendon. This study aimed to validate an MRI-based classification system. We analyzed 130 normal peroneus brevis tendons (power > 0.8, α = 0.05, effect size = 0.31) on consecutive 3T ankle MRI scans. Persons with fractures, ligament injuries, or peroneal tendon pathology were excluded. Each tendon was evaluated on a single standardized axial PD-weighted slice, selected just proximal to the lateral malleolus apex. Seven independent raters classified tendons into four types: general flat, flat with lateral bulge, flat with medial bulge, and oval. Inter-rater reliability was assessed using Cohen’s kappa, Gwet’s AC1, and Fleiss’ kappa. Classification robustness was evaluated using F1 scores, ROC analysis, and precision-recall metrics. The most common forms were general flat (37.7%) and oval (22.3%). Fleiss’ kappa was 0.691 (95% CI 0.629–0.752), with strong pairwise agreement (Cohen’s kappa and Gwet’s AC1: 0.58–0.87). ROC AUC was 0.89; majority voting improved agreement (F1 = 0.93). This classification system is robust and reliable, supporting consistent MRI-based assessment of tendon morphology in clinical and research settings.",

      "abstract": "Purpose We aimed to identify the anterolateral ligament (ALL) tears in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)-deficient knees using standard 1.5-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods We included all patients who underwent primary ACL reconstruction at our center between 2012 and 2015. Exclusion criteria included patients with multiple ligament injuries, lateral collateral ligament, posterolateral corner, and infections, and patients who underwent MRI more than 2 months after their injury. All patients ( n  = 148) had ACL tears that were subsequently arthroscopically reconstructed. The magnetic resonance (MR) images of the injured knees performed within 2 months of injury were reviewed by a musculoskeletal radiologist and an orthopedic surgeon. The patients were divided into two groups. The first group of patients had MRI performed within 1 month of injury. The second group of patients had MRI performed 1–2 months after the index injury. Both assessors were blinded and the MR mages were read separately to assess the presence of ALL, presence of a tear and the location of the tear. Based on their readings, interobserver agreement (kappa statistic (K)), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy were compared. Results The ALL was identified in 100% of the patients. However, there was a discrepancy of up to 15% in the identification of tear of the ALL. In the first group in which MRI scans were performed within 1 month of injury, the ALL tear was identified by the radiologist in 92% of patients and by the surgeon in 90% of patients (Κ = 0.86). In the second group in which MRI scans were performed within 1–2 months of the injury, the ALL tear was identified by the radiologist in 78% of patients and by the surgeon in 93% of patients (K = 0.62). Conclusion The ALL can be accurately identified on MRI, but the presence and location of ALL tear and its location cannot be reliably identified on MRI. The accuracy in identification and characterization of a tear was affected by the interval between the time of injury and the time when the MRI was performed.

In recent years, several imaging biomarkers have been suggested to predict cerebellar mutism syndrome based on its probable pathoanatomical causes. This study investigates the reliability of preoperative imaging biomarkers for cerebellar mutism syndrome in paediatric posterior fossa tumours. Specifically, it examines the interobserver agreement on the size, invasion, and compression of selected regions of interest with structured magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reporting. Preoperative brain MRI scans from ten paediatric patients with posterior fossa tumours, conducted at a single institution, were analysed. The scans were evaluated by three neuroradiologists from three different institutions across two countries using a structured reporting format. The interobserver agreement was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient and Fleiss’ kappa. All estimates were reported with a 95% confidence interval. The study found good to excellent agreement in measuring tumour size, tumour volume, and the Evans index. Substantial agreement was found in tumour pathology and location. However, the interobserver agreement was unreliable for invasion and compression of the included anatomical structures. Findings from this study challenge the reliability of preoperative imaging biomarkers for cerebellar mutism syndrome, emphasising the need for further investigation into consistent and reproducible biomarkers relevant to this syndrome.",

Human amnion epithelial cells (hAEC) are non-MSC cells with therapeutic properties. The primary aim of this study was safety of hAEC therapy. Secondary aims included hAEC efficacy, feasibility of the protocol and impact on quality of life. A phase I open label study of ten adults with active complex Crohn's perianal fistulas refractory to conventional treatment, including anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha therapy, was undertaken. A single dose of hAEC was injected into the fistula tract(s) after surgical closure of the internal opening(s). Study outcomes were assessed at week 24 with follow up for at least 52 weeks. Local injection of hAEC was safe, well tolerated and the injection procedure was feasible. Complete response occurred in 4 patients, and a partial response in an additional 4 patients. There was a mean reduction in the Perianal Disease Activity Index of 6.5 points (95% CI -9.0 to -4.0, p = 0.0002, paired t-test), modified Van Assche MRI Index of 2.3 points (95% CI -3.9 to -0.6, p = 0.012, paired t-test) and a mean improvement of 15.8 points (95% CI 4.9 to 26.8, p = 0.010, paired t-test) in quality of life using the Short IBD-Questionnaire in complete responders. Local injection of hAEC therapy for refractory complex perianal fistulising Crohn's disease appears safe, well-tolerated, feasible and demonstrated improvement.

      "abstract": "Simple Summary International guidelines recommend multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) of the prostate for use by radiologists to identify lesions containing clinically significant prostate cancer, prior to confirmatory biopsy. Automatic assessment of prostate mpMRI using artificial intelligence algorithms holds a currently unrealized potential to improve the diagnostic accuracy achievable by radiologists alone, improve the reporting consistency between radiologists, and enhance reporting quality. In this work, we introduce AutoProstate: a deep learning-powered framework for automatic MRI-based prostate cancer assessment. In particular, AutoProstate utilizes patient data and biparametric MRI to populate an automatic web-based report which includes segmentations of the whole prostate, prostatic zones, and candidate clinically significant prostate cancer lesions, and in addition, several derived characteristics with clinical value are presented. Notably, AutoProstate performed well in external validation using the PICTURE study dataset, suggesting value in prospective multicentre validation, with a view towards future deployment into the prostate cancer diagnostic pathway. Abstract Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) of the prostate is used by radiologists to identify, score, and stage abnormalities that may correspond to clinically significant prostate cancer (CSPCa). Automatic assessment of prostate mpMRI using artificial intelligence algorithms may facilitate a reduction in missed cancers and unnecessary biopsies, an increase in inter-observer agreement between radiologists, and an improvement in reporting quality. In this work, we introduce AutoProstate, a deep learning-powered framework for automatic MRI-based prostate cancer assessment. AutoProstate comprises of three modules: Zone-Segmenter, CSPCa-Segmenter, and Report-Generator. Zone-Segmenter segments the prostatic zones on T2-weighted imaging, CSPCa-Segmenter detects and segments CSPCa lesions using biparametric MRI, and Report-Generator generates an automatic web-based report containing four sections: Patient Details, Prostate Size and PSA Density, Clinically Significant Lesion Candidates, and Findings Summary. In our experiment, AutoProstate was trained using the publicly available PROSTATEx dataset, and externally validated using the PICTURE dataset. Moreover, the performance of AutoProstate was compared to the performance of an experienced radiologist who prospectively read PICTURE dataset cases. In comparison to the radiologist, AutoProstate showed statistically significant improvements in prostate volume and prostate-specific antigen density estimation. Furthermore, AutoProstate matched the CSPCa lesion detection sensitivity of the radiologist, which is paramount, but produced more false positive detections.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Objectives</h4>We aimed to assess inter-radiologist agreement when interpreting pelvic MRI in children with newly diagnosed perianal Crohn's disease (CD).<h4>Materials and methods</h4>In this retrospective multi-reader study, we identified pediatric patients (< 18 years of age) who underwent a pelvic MRI examination for newly diagnosed perianal CD. Images were de-identified and uploaded to a cloud-based image platform for review by 13 fellowship-trained pediatric radiologists The reviewers assessed for the presence of a fistula and abscess, categorization of different imaging findings, and classification using the Parks and St James' University Hospital systems. Fleiss' kappa (κ) statistics and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were used to measure inter-reader agreement, along with 95% confidence intervals (CI).<h4>Results</h4>Forty-six patients were included in our study (median age = 13.0 years [IQR: 10.5 to 16.0 years]); thirty-five (76.1%) were boys. Most imaging features showed fair agreement (κ = 0.21 to 0.35). There was moderate agreement for categorical fistula length (κ = 0.42 [95% CI: 0.32 to 0.53]), involvement of the genitalia (κ = 0.45 [95% CI: 0.26 to 0.63]), and presence of an abscess/collection (κ = 0.52 [95% CI: 0.31 to 0.73]). Maximum abscess/collection length had good agreement (ICC = 0.81 [95% CI: 0.41, 1.00]). There was an almost equal split (yes vs. no: 50.7% vs. 49.3%) regarding whether postcontrast T1-weighted images added value compared to T2-weighted images alone across all radiologists and examinations.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Inter-radiologist agreement when interpreting pelvic MRI for perianal CD in children is fair for most imaging features, with fewer features demonstrating moderate or good agreement.<h4>Key points</h4>Question Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used for diagnosing and monitoring children with perianal Crohn's disease (CD). Limited information is known about inter-radiologist agreement. Findings Agreement between pediatric radiologists when interpreting MRI for perianal CD in children is only fair for most imaging features (κ = 0.21 to 0.35). Clinical relevance Understanding MRI inter-radiologist agreement is crucial to improve the reliability of pelvic MRI in children with perianal Crohn's disease since it may affect patient management (e.g., surgery); further radiologist education and improved imaging feature definitions may help improve inter-radiologist agreement.",

      "abstract": "Objective: Our study aimed to evaluate and validate PanSegNet, a deep learning (DL) algorithm for pediatric pancreas segmentation on MRI in children with acute pancreatitis (AP), chronic pancreatitis (CP), and healthy controls. Methods: With IRB approval, we retrospectively collected 84 MRI scans (1.5T/3T Siemens Aera/Verio) from children aged 2-19 years at Gazi University (2015-2024). The dataset includes healthy children as well as patients diagnosed with AP or CP based on clinical criteria. Pediatric and general radiologists manually segmented the pancreas, then confirmed by a senior pediatric radiologist. PanSegNet-generated segmentations were assessed using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95). Cohen's kappa measured observer agreement. Results: Pancreas MRI T2W scans were obtained from 42 children with AP/CP (mean age: 11.73 +/- 3.9 years) and 42 healthy children (mean age: 11.19 +/- 4.88 years). PanSegNet achieved DSC scores of 88% (controls), 81% (AP), and 80% (CP), with HD95 values of 3.98 mm (controls), 9.85 mm (AP), and 15.67 mm (CP). Inter-observer kappa was 0.86 (controls), 0.82 (pancreatitis), and intra-observer agreement reached 0.88 and 0.81. Strong agreement was observed between automated and manual volumes (R^2 = 0.85 in controls, 0.77 in diseased), demonstrating clinical reliability. Conclusion: PanSegNet represents the first validated deep learning solution for pancreatic MRI segmentation, achieving expert-level performance across healthy and diseased states.

Our goal was to investigate whether SR reconstructions result in an improved agreement in lung volume measurements determined by different raters, also known as inter-rater reliability. In this single-center retrospective study, fetal lung volumes calculated from both SR reconstructions and the original images were analyzed. Three radiologists manually segmented the fetal lungs and rated the image quality of all images and reconstructions. Fetal lung volumes were calculated, and the coefficient of variation (CV) was determined for each set of images. Bland–Altman plots were generated, and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated. A one-sided paired Wilcoxon test was used to compare the fetal lung volume CVs, and a two-sided paired t-test was used to compare the lung volumes. The quality ratings were compared using a two-sided paired Wilcoxon test. A total of 98 fetal scans with gestational ages from 19 to 37 weeks were evaluated. There was a significantly lower CV in the lung volumes segmented from the SR reconstructions (p < 0.001), and the ICCs of the reconstructions were higher than those determined from the original images. Bland–Altman plots demonstrated better agreement in the SR reconstruction lung volumes. No significant differences in quality ratings or lung volumes were found. SR reconstructions of the fetal lungs in MRI enabled better inter-rater reliability of fetal lung volume assessment. SR reconstructions of the fetal body, obtained through fetal MRI, can be a valuable tool for improving the inter-rater reliability of fetal lung volume measurements, a crucial clinical biomarker for assessing fetal development and predicting pregnancy outcomes. Deformable slice-to-volume reconstructions of fetal body MRI could be a valuable clinical tool. Quantitative advantages of fetal body MRI reconstructions need to be proven.

A retrospective case series study was conducted that included patients over 18 years of age with suspected bile duct injury after cholecystectomy, who underwent contrasted magnetic resonance cholangiography, and who also had endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, surgery, or subsequent clinical follow-up. The images were interpreted by two radiologists who assigned the type of lesion according to the Strasberg classification. Qualitative variables were represented by frequencies and proportions, while quantitative variables were described using measures of central tendency and dispersion. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were assessed, along with interobserver variability, using the kappa index. We included 20 patients with a median age of 51.5 years (interquartile range: 35), and 14 (70%) were women. In all 20 patients, lesions were identified on magnetic resonance cholangiography, of which 19 were confirmed with the gold standard for a positive predictive value of 100% (hepatobiliary-specific contrast agents) and 92% (extracellular contrast). The most frequent lesions were Strasberg E2 and E4 in five patients each. The kappa index was 1 in determining the presence or absence of bile duct injury and 0.9 in the Strasberg classification. Contrasted magnetic resonance cholangiography is a method with high positive predictive value and almost perfect interobserver agreement for diagnosing bile duct lesions after cholecystectomy.",

We assessed the reliability and association with clinical symptoms of a method for assessing fatty infiltration, a simplified muscle fat index (MFI). Methods Preoperative axial T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 243 patients aged 66.6 ± 8.5 years (mean ± standard deviation), 119 females (49%), with symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis were assessed. Fatty infiltration was assessed using both the MFI and the Goutallier classification system (GCS). The MFI was calculated as the signal intensity of the psoas muscle divided by that of the multifidus and erector spinae. Observer reliability was assessed in 102 consecutive patients for three independent investigators by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and 95% limits of agreement (LoA) for continuous variables and Gwet’s agreement coefficient (AC1) for categorical variables. Associations with patient-reported pain and disability were assessed using univariate and multivariate regression analyses. Results Interobserver reliability was good for the MFI (ICC 0.79) and fair for the GCS (AC1 0.33). Intraobserver reliability was good or excellent for the MFI (ICC range 0.86–0.91) and moderate to almost perfect for the GCS (AC1 range 0.55–0.92). Mean interobserver differences of MFI measurements ranged from -0.09 to -0.04 (LoA -0.32 to 0.18). Adjusted for potential confounders, none of the disability or pain parameters was significantly associated with MFI or GCS. Conclusion The proposed MFI demonstrated high observer reliability but was not associated with preoperative pain or disability.",

      "abstract": "Purpose: To characterize the non-laminar flow dynamics and resultant decreased wall shear stress (WSS) and high oscillatory shear index (OSI) of the infrarenal abdominal aortic dilatation, cardiac phase-resolved 3D phase-contrast MRI (4D-flow MRI) was performed. Methods: The prospective single-arm study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and included 18 subjects (median 67.5 years) with the dilated infrarenal aorta (median diameter 35 mm). 4D-flow MRI was conducted on a 1.5T MRI system. On 3D streamline images, laminar and non-laminar (i.e., vortex or helical) flow patterns were visually assessed both for the dilated aorta and for the undilated upstream aorta. Cardiac phase-resolved flow velocities, WSS and OSI, were also measured for the dilated aorta and the upstream undilated aorta. Results: Non-laminar flow represented by vortex or helical flow was more frequent and overt in the dilated aorta than in the undilated upstream aorta (P < 0.0156) with a very good interobserver agreement (weighted kappa: 0.82–1.0). The WSS was lower, and the OSI was higher on the dilated aortic wall compared with the proximal undilated segments. In mid-systole, mean spatially-averaged WSS was 0.20 ± 0.016 Pa for the dilated aorta vs. 0.68 ± 0.071 Pa for undilated upstream aorta (P < 0.0001), and OSI on the dilated aortic wall was 0.093 ± 0.010 vs. 0.041 ± 0.0089 (P = 0.013). The maximum values and the amplitudes of the WSS at the dilated aorta were inversely proportional to the ratio of dilated/undilated aortic diameter (r = −0.694, P = 0.0014). Conclusion: 4D-flow can characterize abnormal non-laminar flow dynamics within the dilated aorta in vivo. The wall of the infrarenal aortic dilatation is continuously and increasingly affected by atherogenic stimuli due to the flow disturbances represented by vortex or helical flow, which is reflected by lower WSS and higher OSI.",

For every patient, breath-holding time, body mass index, sex, age were recorded. The phase without contrast media and the arterial phases were independently evaluated by two radiologists who quantified Gibbs artefacts, noise, respiratory motion artefacts and general image quality. Presence or absence of Gibbs artefacts and noise was compared by the McNemar's test. Respiratory motion artefacts and image quality scores were compared using Wilcoxon signed rank test. Interobserver agreement was assessed by Cohen kappa statistics.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared with TWIST-VIBE, CAIPIRINHA-VIBE images had better scores for every parameter except higher noise score. Triple arterial phases were always acquired with TWIST-VIBE but failed in 37% using CAIPIRINHA-VIBE: 11% have only one arterial phase, 26% have two. Breath-holding time was the only parameter that influenced the success of multi-arterial techniques.

Multiple imagining methods are available to evaluate it, among which magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most advanced noninvasive preoperative method. However, it is limited in its visualization function. AIM To investigate the use of intraluminal MRI for perianal fistulas via a novel direct MRI fistulography method. METHODS We mixed 3% hydrogen peroxide (HP) with gadolinium for HPMRI fistulography, retrospectively analyzing 60 cases of complex/recurrent fistula-in-ano using physical examination, trans-perineal ultrasonography (TPUS), low-spatial-resolution MRI, and high-resolution direct HPMRI fistulography. We assessed detection rates of fistula tracks, internal openings, their relationship with anal sphincters, and perianal abscesses using statistical analyses, including interobserver agreement (Kappa statistic), and compared results with intraoperative findings. RESULTS Surgical confirmation in 60 cases showed that high-resolution direct HPMRI fistulography provided superior detection rates for internal openings (153) and fistula tracks (162) compared to physical exams, TPUS, and low-spatial-resolution MRI (Z > 5.7, P < 0.05). The effectiveness of physical examination and TPUS was also inferior to that of our method for detecting perianal abscesses (54) (Z = 6.773, 3.694, P < 0.05), whereas that of low-spatial-resolution MRI was not significantly different (Z = 1.851, P = 0.06). High-resolution direct HPMRI fistulography also achieved the highest interobserver agreement (Kappa: 0.89, 0.85, and 0.80), while low-spatial-resolution MRI showed moderate agreement (Kappa: 0.78, 0.74, and 0.69). TPUS and physical examination had lower agreement (Kappa range: 0.33-0.63). CONCLUSION High-resolution direct HPMRI fistulography enhances the visualization of recurrent and complex fistula-in-ano, including branched fistulas, allowing for precise planning and improved surgical outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Internal hydrocephalus is the most common malformation of the central nervous system in dogs. Although the grades of ventricular distension have importance for long-term prognosis, there is no standard classification scheme describing the grade of the ventricular distension in dogs. Materials and methods Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from 147 dogs of various breed, sex, skull conformation, and weight were reviewed retrospectively and blinded between three observers. Based on objectively assessable morphologic characteristics, the lateral cerebral ventricles were graded as normal, minimally, mildly, moderately, severely enlarged or end stage (grade 0 to grade 5), respectively. Evans’ index or the ventricle brain index was also measured in all animals. Interobserver agreement between a very experienced, experienced, and unexperienced person was evaluated by the Spearman coefficient and kappa tests. Additionally, correlation to the ventricle brain index was determined using the Spearman coefficient and F-tests. Results The Spearman correlation coefficient reached a very strong correlation (r = 0.97) between the experienced and very experienced observer and a strong correlation (r = 0.91) between the very experienced and unexperienced observer. The kappa value revealed excellent interobserver agreement between the very experienced and experienced observers (weighted kappa 0.91) and moderate between the very experienced and unexperienced observers (weighted kappa 0.75). The ventricular-brain index correlated (r = 0.94, Spearman coefficient test) with the grading system, indicating that a more elevated ratio was related to a more advanced degree of ventricular enlargement. The interobserver agreement with regard to the grade between the neurologist in training and a board-certified neurologist was excellent and between the board-certified neurologist and general practitioner achieved lower values. Conclusion The presented MRI-based grading of ventricular enlargement is a reliable and functional method for an objective grading of the ventricular system in dogs. Some experience in MRI and brain anatomy is needed for interpretation and grading.",

Patients with or without CP constituted the study and the control groups in this cross-sectional investigation. Two reviewers interpreted the dataset regarding the SP-ET index. This ratio was calculated as the distance between the most superior point of patella and the entrance of femoral trochlea (β) divided by the patellar articular surface length (α). The relationship between the SP-ET index and CP was presented using independent samples T-tests, and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated to reveal the interobserver differences. Results There was excellent agreement between the reviewers regarding α, β, and SP-ET values (ICC was 0.971, 0.964, and 0.943, respectively). Higher SP-ET values were obtained for patients with CP, in comparison with patients without any chondral lesion (p < 0.001). A significant, positive, and moderate level of correlation was revealed between SP-ET measurements and CP grades for the total study population.

This single-centre retrospective study included patients from 2019 to 2022 with sonographically indeterminate or solid ovarian masses who underwent MRI with a specific protocol for characterisation according to O-RADS MRI specifications. Each study was evaluated using O-RADS lexicon by two radiologists, one with 17 years of experience in gynaecological radiology and another with 4 years of experience in general radiology. Findings were classified as benign, borderline, or malignant according to histology or stability over time. Diagnostic performance and interobserver agreement were assessed. A total of 183 patients with US indeterminate or solid adnexal masses were included. Fifty-seven (31%) did not have ovarian masses, classified as O-RADS 1. The diagnostic performance for scores 2–5 was excellent with a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 97.4%, 100%, 96.2%, and 100%, respectively by the experienced radiologist and 96.1%, 92.0%, 93.9%, and 94.8% by the inexperienced radiologist. Interobserver concordance was very high (Kappa index 0.92). Almost all the misclassified cases were due to misinterpretation of the classification similar to reports in the literature. The diagnostic performance of O-RADS MRI determined by either experienced or inexperienced radiologists is excellent, facilitating decision-making with high diagnostic accuracy and high reproducibility. Knowledge of this classification and use of assessment tools could avoid frequent errors due to misinterpretation. Up to 31% of ovarian masses are considered indeterminate by transvaginal US and 32% of solid lesions considered malignant by transvaginal US are benign. The O-RADs MRI accurately classifies these masses, even when used by inexperienced radiologists, thereby avoiding incorrect surgical approaches. • O-RADS MRI accurately classifies indeterminate and solid ovarian masses by ultrasound. • There is excellent interobserver agreement between experienced and non-experienced radiologists. • O-RADS MRI is a helpful tool to assess clinical decision-making in ovarian tumours.",

Regions of interest (ROI) were delineated on non-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), high b-value diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) images; radiomic features were subsequently extracted. The most significant radiomic features were selected using the t-test and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator with cross-validation (LASSO-CV). We identified clinical risk factors for clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (CR-POPF) using univariate logistic regression. Ten distinct machine learning algorithms were used to develop radiomics and clinical models, which were then integrated via weighted voting. Model performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calibration curves.<h4>Results</h4>Eight radiomic features and one clinical feature (BMI) were selected for model construction. Among the ten machine learning algorithms, the Random Forest (RF) algorithm yielded the optimal radiomics model, achieving an AUC of 0.702, an F1-score of 0.571, and an accuracy of 0.857 in the test set. The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm produced the optimal clinical model, with corresponding values of 0.846, 0.640, and 0.786. Finally, the integrated model, developed using a weighted voting strategy, demonstrated superior comprehensive performance with an AUC of 0.899, showing excellent discrimination and calibration.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The machine learning model using preoperative multi-sequence MRI radiomic features showed moderate predictive value for CR-POPF risk, which was significantly enhanced by integrating BMI.",

All patients with perianal CD treated with anti-TNF-α therapy at our tertiary care center were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical assessment. Two MR examinations were performed: at initiation of anti-TNF-α treatment and then at least 2 years after. Clinical assessment (remission, response and non-response) was based on Present's criteria. Rectoscopic patterns, MRI Van Assche score, and MRI fistula activity signs (T2 signal and contrast enhancement) were collected for the two MR examinations. Fistula healing was defined as the absence of T2 hyperintensity and contrast enhancement on MRI. Deep remission was defined as the association of both clinical remission, absence of anal canal ulcers and healing on MRI. Characteristics and imaging patterns of patients with and without deep remission were compared by univariate and multivariate analyses. Forty-nine consecutive patients (31 females and 18 males) were included. They ranged in age from 14-70 years (mean, 33 years). MRI and clinical assessment were performed after a mean period of exposure to anti-TNF-α therapy of 40 ± 3.7 mo. Clinical remission, response and non-response were observed in 53.1%, 20.4%, and 26.5% of patients, respectively. Deep remission was observed in 32.7% of patients. Among the 26 patients in clinical remission, 10 had persisting inflammation of fistulas on MRI (T2 hyperintensity, <i>n</i> = 7; contrast enhancement, <i>n</i> = 10). Univariate analysis showed that deep remission was associated with the absence of rectal involvement and the absence of switch of anti-TNF-α treatment or surgery requirement. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that only the absence of rectal involvement (OR = 4.6; 95%CI: 1.03-20.5) was associated with deep remission. Deep remission is achieved in approximately one third of patients on maintenance anti-TNF-α therapy. Absence of rectal involvement is predictive of deep remission.",

      "abstract": "Purpose To analyze the performance of deep learning (DL) models for segmentation of the neonatal lung in MRI and investigate the use of automated MRI-based features for assessment of neonatal lung disease. Materials and Methods Quiet-breathing MRI was prospectively performed in two independent cohorts of preterm infants (median gestational age, 26.57 weeks; IQR, 25.3–28.6 weeks; 55 female and 48 male infants) with (n = 86) and without (n = 21) chronic lung disease (bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD]). Convolutional neural networks were developed for lung segmentation, and a three-dimensional reconstruction was used to calculate MRI features for lung volume, shape, pixel intensity, and surface. These features were explored as indicators of BPD and disease-associated lung structural remodeling through correlation with lung injury scores and multinomial models for BPD severity stratification. Results The lung segmentation model reached a volumetric Dice coefficient of 0.908 in cross-validation and 0.880 on the independent test dataset, matching expert-level performance across disease grades. MRI lung features demonstrated significant correlations with lung injury scores and added structural information for the separation of neonates with BPD (BPD vs no BPD: average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.92 ± 0.02 [SD]; no or mild BPD vs moderate or severe BPD: average AUC, 0.84 ± 0.03). Conclusion This study demonstrated high performance of DL models for MRI neonatal lung segmentation and showed the potential of automated MRI features for diagnostic assessment of neonatal lung disease while avoiding radiation exposure.

      "abstract": "Abstract Background and Aims Characteristic magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] features associated with long-term perianal fistula closure are still being discussed. This study evaluated the predictive value of degree of fibrosis and disease activity (MAGNIFI-CD index) at MRI for long-term clinical closure of Crohn’s perianal fistulas. Methods Crohn’s disease [CD] patients treated with surgical closure following anti-tumour necrosis factor [anti-TNF] induction or anti-TNF alone for high perianal fistulas as part of a patient preference randomized controlled trial [PISA-II] between 2013 and 2020 with a post-treatment MRI and long-term clinical follow-up data were retrospectively included. Two radiologists scored the degree of fibrosis and MAGNIFI-CD index at pre- and post-treatment MRI. The accuracy of post-treatment MRI findings in predicting long-term clinical closure [12 months after the MRI] was evaluated using receiver operating characteristics [ROC] analysis. Results Fifty patients were included: 31 female, median age 33 years (interquartile range [IQR] 26–45). Fourteen patients showed a 100% fibrotic fistula at post-treatment MRI, all of which had long-term clinical closure. Median MAGNIFI-CD index at post-treatment MRI was 0 [IQR 0–5] in 25 patients with long-term clinical closure and 16 [IQR 10-20] in 25 patients without. ROC analysis showed an area under the curve of 0.90 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.82–0.99) for degree of fibrosis and 0.95 [95% CI 0.89–1.00] for the MAGNIFI-CD index, with a Youden cut-off point of 6 [91% specificity, 87% sensitivity]. Conclusions Degree of fibrosis and MAGNIFI-CD index at post-treatment MRI are accurate in predicting long-term clinical closure and seem valuable in follow-up of perianal CD. A completely fibrotic tract at MRI is a robust indicator for long-term fistula closure. EudraCT 2013-002932-25 and 2018-002064-15",

This study aimed to verify the association of MRE metrics with histologic fibrosis independent of inflammation.<h4>Methods</h4>This prospective European multicenter study performed MRE imaging on 60 patients with CD with bowel strictures before surgical resection. Locations of 61 histological samples were annotated on MRE examinations, followed by central readings using the Chiorean score and measurement of delayed gain of enhancement (DGE), magnetization transfer ratio, T2-weighted MRI sequences (T2R), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and the magnetic resonance index of activity (MaRIA). Correlations of histology and MRE metrics were assessed. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were used to select composite MRE scores predictive of histology and to estimate their predictive value.<h4>Results</h4>ADC and MaRIA correlated with fibrosis (R = -0.71, P < 0.0001, and 0.59, P < 0.001) and more moderately with inflammation (R = -0.35, P < 0.01, and R = 0.53, P < 0.001). Lower or no correlations of fibrosis or inflammation were found with DGE, magnetization transfer ratio, or T2R. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator and ROC identified a composite score of MaRIA, ADC, and DGE as a very good predictor of histologic fibrosis (ROC area under the curve = 0.910). MaRIA alone was the best predictor of histologic inflammation with excellent performance in identifying active histologic inflammation (ROC area under the curve = 0.966).<h4>Discussion</h4>MRE-based scores for histologic fibrosis and inflammation may assist in the characterization of CD stenosis and enable development of fibrosis-targeted therapies and clinical treatment of stenotic patients.",

      "abstract": "To compare the responsiveness of linear and volumetric assessments of intestinal inflammation in children with newly diagnosed ileal Crohn disease (CD) into treatment. Twenty children with ileal CD (8 girls; mean age = 14.0 years) between May 2019 and April 2021 underwent research MRI at three time points—diagnosis, 6 weeks, and 6 months into treatment. For each examination, a radiologist measured the maximum wall thickness and length of disease. Then, the inflamed ileum was manually and semi-automatically segmented to measure the tissue volume. Mixed-effects models were used to assess the changes over time. Intra-class correlation was used to assess agreement between manual and semi-automated segmentation. Length of disease decreased with medical treatment (19.2 vs. 12.2 vs. 8.0 cm; p = 0.002), 36% from baseline to 6 weeks and 58% from baseline to 6 months, while maximum bowel wall thickness also decreased over time (7.6 vs. 5.8 vs. 4.5 mm; p < 0.0001), 24% from baseline to 6 weeks and 41% from baseline to 6 months. Manual volumetric measurements demonstrated a significant treatment response (19.8 vs.11.6 vs.5.1 mL; p < 0.0001), 41% decrease from baseline to 6 weeks and 74% from baseline to 6 months. Using semi-automated segmentation, the volume decreased significantly over time as well (24.0 vs.15.1 vs.9.1 mL; p = 0.0007), 37% from baseline to 6 weeks and 62% from baseline to 6 months. There was good agreement between manual and semi-automated volumetric assessments (ICC = 0.78 [95% CI: 0.57–0.88]). Volumetric measurement of inflammation is responsive to medical treatment in CD and, as percentage compared to baseline, may show greater treatment response than linear measurements. QuestionVolumetric measurements of intestinal inflammation related to Crohn disease may be superior to traditional linear measurements. FindingsVolumetric measurements showed greater treatment response when compared to linear measurements, and there was good agreement between manual and semi-automated volumetric measurements of intestinal inflammation. Clinical relevanceVolumetric assessment is a promising tool that may provide a novel biomarker for evaluating intestinal inflammation and treatment response in Crohn Disease.",

Magnetic resonance imaging is the gold standard for evaluating fistula healing in pfCD, but variability in radiological definitions hampers meaningful clinical interpretation and consistent trial design. This study aimed to establish an international consensus on the definition of radiological healing in pfCD. The study was conducted in 2 phases. Phase 1 involved a systematic review to identify magnetic resonance imaging-based variables and indices used to define healing in pfCD, assessing methodological quality using the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) framework. Phase 2 utilized a 2-round online Delphi consensus process with 84 international experts, followed by a stakeholder meeting to achieve consensus (agreement threshold >80%). Results were reported as per Accurate Consensus Reporting Document (ACCORD) guidelines. A radiologically healed fistula can be defined by the absence of T2-weighted hyperintensity, a completely fibrotic fistula tract and, when contrast is used, the absence of contrast enhancement on post-contrast T1-weighted images (95% consensus). Radiological improvement of a fistula can be defined (80% consensus) by the presence of a least one essential criterion: an increasingly fibrotic fistula tract, an unequivocal reduction in one or more of the following: T2-weighted hyperintensity, fistula diameter, fistula length, abscess size, or contrast enhancement of the fistula tract. This international Delphi consensus standardizes radiological endpoints in pfCD, improving consistency in clinical and research settings. Future studies will validate this definition and assess how radiological changes predict long-term clinical outcomes and quality of life improvements.",

      "abstract": "Although the clinical efficacy of infliximab as measured by closure of fistulas in Crohn's disease has been demonstrated, its influence on the inflammatory changes in the fistula tracks is less clear. The aim of the present study was to assess the behavior of perianal fistulas before and after infliximab treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical evaluation were performed in a total of 18 patients before and after treatment with infliximab. An MRI-based score of perianal Crohn's disease severity was developed using both criteria of local extension of fistulas (complexity, supralavetoric extension, relation to the sphincters and of active inflammation (T2 hyperintensity, presence of cavities/abscesses, and rectal wall involvement). The MRI score was reliable in assessing the fistula tracks, with a good interobserver concordance (p < 0.001). Fistula tracks with signs of active inflammation were found in all 18 patients at baseline and collections in seven. After short-term infliximab treatment, active tracks persisted in eight of 11 patients who had clinically responded to infliximab. After long-term (46 wk) infliximab therapy, MRI signs of active track inflammation had resolved in three of six patients. We have developed an MRI-based score of perianal Crohn's disease severity to assess the anatomical evolution of Crohn's fistulas. Our study demonstrates that despite closure of draining external orifices after infliximab therapy, fistula tracks persist with varying degrees of residual inflammation, which may cause recurrent fistulas and pelvic abscesses. Whether complete fistula fibrosis occurs over time with repeated infliximab infusions needs further study.",

      "abstract": "Background Myocardial fibrosis is often detected in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), which causes left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and tachyarrhythmias. Purpose To evaluate the potential value of a machine learning (ML) approach that uses radiomic features from late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and cine images for the prediction of ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VT) in patients with HCM. Material and Methods Hyperenhancing areas of LV myocardium on LGE images were manually segmented, and the segmentation was propagated to corresponding areas on cine images. Radiomic features were extracted using the PyRadiomics library. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was employed for radiomic feature selection. Our model development employed the TabPFN algorithm, an adapted Prior-Data Fitted Network design. Model performance was evaluated graphically and numerically over five-repeat fivefold cross-validation. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were employed to determine the relative importance of selected radiomic features. Results Our cohort consisted of 60 patients with HCM (73.3% male; median age = 51.5 years), among whom 17 had documented VT during the follow-up. A total of 1612 radiomic features were extracted for each patient. The LASSO algorithm led to a final selection of 18 radiomic features. The model achieved a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.877, demonstrating good discrimination, and a mean Brier score of 0.119, demonstrating good calibration. Conclusion Radiomics-based ML models are promising for predicting VT in patients with HCM during the follow-up period. Developing predictive models as clinically useful decision-making tools may significantly improve risk assessment and prognosis.",

Nine conventional MRI sequences and clinical data were used to train a convolutional neural network to reconstruct MRE images at the per-voxel level. The architecture was further modified to accept multichannel three-dimensional inputs and to allow inclusion of clinical and demographic information. Liver stiffness and fibrosis category (F0 [no fibrosis] to F4 [significant fibrosis]) of reconstructed images were assessed by using voxel- and patient-level agreement by correlation, sensitivity, and specificity calculations; in addition, classification by receiver operator characteristic analyses was performed, and Dice score was used to evaluate hepatic stiffness locality.\n\n\nResults\nThe model for predicting liver stiffness incorporated four image sequences (precontrast T1-weighted liver acquisition with volume acquisition [LAVA] water and LAVA fat, 120-second-delay T1-weighted LAVA water, and single-shot fast spin-echo T2 weighted) and clinical data. The model had a patient-level and voxel-level correlation of 0.50 ± 0.05 and 0.34 ± 0.03, respectively.

This study aimed to assess both short- and long-term effectiveness of UST in PFCD and to identify thresholds predicting fistula clinical remission. This retrospective cohort included 89 PFCD patients treated with UST. Evaluations utilized the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI), Perianal Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (PDAI), and Fistula Drainage Assessment (FDA). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the Van Assche Index (VAI) was performed at 52 weeks. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves identified UST trough levels predictive of clinical remission. The fistula clinical remission rates were 66.3% (59/89) at 16/20 weeks and 74.2% (66/89) at 52 weeks. Biochemical markers, including CRP, ESR, and PLT, significantly decreased, while RBC and HB levels increased after treatment (p < 0.05). MRI showed fistula improvement in 54.7% (35/64) of patients and complete healing in 21.8% (14/64). Comparative analysis revealed that anti-TNF-naïve patients had significantly higher rates of fistula remission, whereas seton insertion did not affect long-term fistula healing. ROC analysis identified UST trough concentrations ≥3.95 µg/mL at 16/20 weeks as predictive of clinical fistula remission (AUC: 0.791; sensitivity: 73.8%; specificity: 78.6%). UST achieves 74.2% fistula clinical remission at 52 weeks in PFCD, with trough concentrations at 16/20 weeks predictive of clinical remission.

Inter-rater reliability was assessed using Fleiss’ kappa and Gwet’s AC with conditional confidence intervals. Ordinal weighting was applied to relevant features. High inter-rater reliability was observed for multifocality, enhancement quality, cyst presence, enhanced tumor crossing of midline, and calvarial remodeling. There was poor agreement for diffusion characteristics, hemorrhage presence, involvement of eloquent brain regions, and T1/FLAIR ratio. Several features, including ependymal invasion and tumor size, showed borderline reliability. Inter-rater reliability varied across the 29 features evaluated for glioma imaging.

      "abstract": "Abstract Background and Aims Intestinal ultrasound [IUS] is an accurate, patient-centreed monitoring tool that objectively evaluates Crohn’s disease [CD] activity. However no current, widely accepted, reproducible activity index exists to facilitate consistent IUS identification of inflammatory activity. The aim of this study is to identify key parameters of CD inflammation on IUS, evaluate their reliability, and develop an IUS index reflecting segmental activity. Methods There were three phases: [1] expert consensus Delphi method to derive measures of IUS activity; [2] an initial, multi-expert case acquisition and expert interpretation of 20 blinded cases, to measure inter-rater reliability for individual measures; [3] refinement of case acquisition and interpretation by 12 international experts, with 30 blinded case reads with reliability assessment and development of a segmental activity score. Results Delphi consensus: 11 experts representing seven countries identified four key parameters including: [1] bowel wall thickness [BWT]; [2] bowel wall stratification; [3] hyperaemia of the wall [colour Doppler imaging]; and [4] inflammatory mesenteric fat. Blind read: each variable exhibited moderate to substantial reliability. Optimal, standardised image and cineloop acquisition were established. Second blind read and score development: intra-class correlation coefficient [ICC] for BWT was almost perfect at 0.96 [0.94–0.98]. All four parameters correlated with the global disease activity assessment and were included in the final International Bowel Ultrasound Segmental Activity Score with almost perfect ICC (0.97 [0.95–0.99, p <0.001]). Conclusions Using expert consensus and standardised approaches, identification of key activity measurements on IUS has been achieved and a segmental activity score has been proposed, demonstrating excellent reliability.",

      "abstract": "Background Range of motion (ROM) is an important aspect of orthopaedic patient assessment. It can be measured at the knee joint by determining the knee flexion angle (KFA) a patient can achieve at extremes of flexion and extension. As with any measurement, the accuracy and reliability of the method used determine its validity. The consistency of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans as compared to the current gold standard of X-ray remains unknown in terms of KFA evaluation. The aim of this study was to assess and compare the reliability of measuring KFA between X-ray and MRI scans. Methods This study included 80 patients (94 knees) who had attended a specialist knee clinic due to varying knee pathologies and undergone both X-ray and MRI scans. Lateral and T1-weighted sagittal imaging views (respectively) were used to measure KFA by two trained observers independently at two separate time points, 8 weeks apart. The data was then statistically analysed and intra- and inter-observer reliability calculated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results The intra-observer reliability for X-ray was 0.96 (P<0.001) and that for MRI was 0.83 (P<0.001). The inter-observer reliability for X-ray was 0.99 (P<0.001) and that for MRI was 0.81 (P<0.001). All the intra-class correlation coefficients were graded as excellent in both the intra- and inter-observer reliability analysis. Overall, the mean KFA was notably higher on X-ray measurements than that on MRI scans. There was a statistically significant difference between Time 1 and Time 2 measurements (17.7° vs. 16.8°) for MRI data (P=0.022). No significant difference was found for X-ray measurements (46.4° vs. 45.6°) in this regard (P=0.182). Conclusions Both X-ray and MRI allow KFA to be measured with an excellent degree of reliability. However, X-ray measurements were overall superior to that of MRI mainly due to the larger field of view of the visible on-screen image which more readily identifies the anatomical landmarks required to measure KFA.",

      "abstract": "Background Managing low back pain (LBP) often involves MRI despite the fact that international guidelines do not recommend routine imaging. To allow us to explore the topic and use this knowledge in further research, a reliable method to review the MRI referrals is needed. Consequently, this study aimed to assess the inter-rater reliability of a method evaluating lumbar spine MRI referrals’ appropriateness. Methods Four inexperienced students (chiropractic master’s students) and a senior clinician (chiropractor) were included as independent raters in this inter-rater reliability study. Lumbar spine MRI referrals from primary care on patients (> 18 years) with LBP with or without leg pain were included. The referrals were classified using a modified version of the American College of Radiology (ACR) imaging appropriateness criteria for LBP. Categories of appropriate referrals included; fractures, cancer, previous surgery, candidate for surgery or suspicion of cauda equina. Inappropriate referrals included lacking information on previous non-surgical treatment, no word on non-surgical treatment duration, or “other reasons” for inappropriate referrals. After two rounds of training and consensus sessions, 50 lumbar spine MRI referrals were reviewed independently by the five raters. Inter-rater reliability was quantified using unweighted Kappa statistics, and the observed agreement was calculated with both a pairwise comparison and an overall five-rater comparison. Results Inter-rater reliability was substantial, with a Kappa value for appropriate vs. inappropriate referrals of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.55–0.89). When six and eight subcategories were evaluated, the Kappa values were 0.77 (95% CI: 0.58–0.91) and 0.82 (95% CI: 0.72–0.92), respectively. The overall percentage of agreement for appropriate and inappropriate referrals was 92% and ranged from 88 to 98% for the pairwise comparisons of the five raters’ results. For the six and eight subcategories, the overall agreement was 92 and 88%, respectively, ranging from 88 to 98% and 84–92%, respectively, for the pairwise comparisons. Conclusion The inter-rater reliability of the evaluation of the appropriateness of lumbar spine MRI referrals, according to the modified ACR-appropriateness criteria, was found to range from substantial to almost perfect and can be used for research and quality assurance purposes.",

      "abstract": "Objective: To assess the reliability of measurements of paraspinal muscle transverse relaxation times (T2 times) between two observers and within one observer on different time points. Methods: 14 participants (9f/5m, 33 ± 5 years, 176 ± 10 cm, 73 ± 12 kg) underwent 2 consecutive MRI scans (M1,M2) on the same day, followed by 1 MRI scan 13–14 days later (M3) in a mobile 1.5 Tesla MRI. T2 times were calculated in T2 weighted turbo spin-echo-sequences at the spinal level of the third lumbar vertebrae (11 slices, 2 mm slice thickness, 1 mm interslice gap, echo times: 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 ms) for M. erector spinae (ES) and M. multifidius (MF). The following reliability parameter were calculated for the agreement of T2 times between two different investigators (OBS1 & OBS2) on the same MRI (inter-rater reliability, IR) and by one investigator between different MRI of the same participant (intersession variability, IS): Test–Retest Variability (TRV, Differences/Mean*100); Coefficient of Variation (CV, Standard deviation/Mean*100); Bland–Altman Analysis (systematic bias = Mean of the Differences; Upper/Lower Limits of Agreement = Bias+/−1.96*SD); Intraclass Correlation Coefficient 3.1 (ICC) with absolute agreement, as well as its 95% confidence interval. Results: Mean TRV for IR was 2.6% for ES and 4.2% for MF. Mean TRV for IS was 3.5% (ES) and 5.1% (MF). Mean CV for IR was 1.9 (ES) and 3.0 (MF). Mean CV for IS was 2.5% (ES) and 3.6% (MF). A systematic bias of 1.3 ms (ES) and 2.1 ms (MF) were detected for IR and a systematic bias of 0.4 ms (ES) and 0.07 ms (MF) for IS. ICC for IR was 0.94 (ES) and 0.87 (MF). ICC for IS was 0.88 (ES) and 0.82 (MF). Conclusion: Reliable assessment of paraspinal muscle T2 time justifies its use for scientific purposes. The applied technique could be recommended to use for future studies that aim to assess changes of T2 times, e.g. after an intense bout of eccentric exercises.",

      "abstract": "Objectives Ultrasound measurement of the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) is a rapid, non-invasive means to indirectly assess intracranial pressure. Previous research has demonstrated the ability of emergency physicians to measure ONSD accurately with bedside ultrasound when compared to CT scan or MRI, however the reliability of this measurement between two or more operators has been called into question (Hassen et al. in J Emerg Med 48:450–457, 2015; Shirodkar et al. in Ind J Crit Care Med 19:466–470, 2015). Given the need for accurate and precise measurement to use this as a screening exam, we sought to determine the inter-rater reliability between ONSD measurements obtained in real time by fellowship-trained emergency ultrasound physicians. Methods Three ultrasound fellowship-trained emergency physicians measured bilateral ONSD of 10 healthy volunteers using a high-frequency linear transducer. The physicians were blinded to the other scanners’ measurements, and no instructions were given other than to obtain the ONSD. Each sonographer measured the ONSD in real time and it was recorded by a research coordinator. All measurements were recorded in millimeters. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated to estimate the inter-rater reliability. Results A total of 60 measurements of ONSD were obtained. The average measurement was 4.3 mm (3.83–4.77). Very little variation was found between the three physicians, with a calculated ICC of 0.82 (95% confidence interval 0.63–0.92). Conclusions ONSD measurement obtained by ultrasound fellowship-trained emergency medicine physicians is a reliable measurement with a high degree of correlation between scanners.",

The interpretation of lumbar spine MRI scans is subject to variability and there is a lack of studies where reliability of multiple degenerative pathologies are rated simultaneously. The objective of our study was to determine the inter-rater reliability of three independent raters evaluating degenerative pathologies seen with lumbar spine MRI. Methods Fifty-nine people, 35 patients with low back pain (LBP) or LBP and leg pain and 24 people without LBP or leg pain, received an MRI of the lumbar spine. Three raters (one radiologist and two chiropractors) evaluated the MRIs for the presence and severity of eight degenerative spinal pathologies using a standardized format: Spondylolisthesis, scoliosis, annular fissure, disc degeneration, disc contour, nerve root compromise, spinal stenosis and facet joint degeneration. Findings were identified and classified at disc level according to type and severity. Raters were instructed to evaluate all study sample persons once to assess inter-rater reliability (fully crossed design). Reliability was calculated using Gwet’s Agreement Coefficients (AC 1 and AC 2 ) and Cohen’s Kappa (κ) and Conger’s extension of Cohen’s. Gwet’s probabilistic benchmarking method to the Landis and Koch scale was used. MRI-findings achieving substantial reliability was considered acceptable. Results Inter-rater reliability for all raters combined, ranged from (Gwet’s AC 1 or AC 2 ): 0.64–0.99 and according to probabilistic benchmarking to the Landis and Koch scale equivalent to moderate to almost perfect reliability. Overall reliability level for individual pathologies was almost perfect reliability for spondylolisthesis, spinal stenosis, scoliosis and annular fissure, substantial for nerve root compromise and disc degeneration, and moderate for facet joint degeneration and disc contour. Conclusion Inter-rater reliability for 3 raters, evaluating 177 disc levels, was found to be overall acceptable for 6 out of 8 degenerative MRI-findings in the lumbar spine. Ratings of facet joint degeneration and disc contour achieved moderate reliability and was considered unacceptable.",

Twenty-two consecutive patients with clinical suspicion of perianal sepsis were studied using an endoanal coil followed immediately by a phased array coil. T1-weighted precontrast and postcontrast and STIR images in transverse and coronal planes were produced with each coil and analysed by noting the presence and site of a collection, primary track, the position of any internal opening, and subcutaneous or supralevator extension. An \"expert\" and also a \"trainee\" radiologist assessed the images. Operative findings were similarly recorded. The Fisher exact test was used to compare imaging with surgery. Interobserver variation was calculated using a kappa statistic. Of 22 patients with suspected fistulas, 8 were simple, 4 were complex, and 3 were superficial sinuses. Five had no anal pathology, 1 had anal excoriation, and 1 had a polyp. At surgery, 6 intersphincteric, 1 transsphincteric, 8 extrasphincteric, no supralevator collections, and 9 internal openings were noted. The overall sensitivity and specificity for detecting these were 75% and 64%, respectively, for STIR imaging, and 58.3% and 62.8% for gadolinium-enhanced imaging. There was good agreement between the \"trainee\" and the \"expert\" in the interpretation of images (kappa=0.7). A STIR sequence is more sensitive overall than gadolinium-enhanced techniques on endoanal magnetic resonance imaging of fistulas-in-ano because of increased sensitivity in detecting the internal opening. A combination of endoanal and phased array techniques using STIR imaging sequences is valuable preoperative assessment in both simple and complex cases.",

Abstract Objective  The objectives of this study are to compare absolute values of acromial index (AI) and critical shoulder angle (CSA) obtained in both radiographs and magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the shoulder; and to compare the interobserver and intra-observer agreement for AI and CSA values measured in these image modalities. Methods  Patients who had medical indication of investigating shoulders conditions through radiographs and MRI were included. Images were taken to two fellowship-trained shoulder surgeons, which conducted measurements of AI and CSA in radiographs and in MRI. Twelve weeks after the first evaluation, a second evaluation was conducted. Inter- and intra-observer reliability was presented as an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and agreement was classified according to Landis & Koch criteria. The differences between two measurements were evaluated using Bland-Altman plots. Results  134 shoulders in 124 subjects were included. Mean intra-observer ICC for CSA in X-rays and in MRI were 0.936 and 0.940, respectively; for AI, 0.908 and 0.022. Mean inter-observer ICC for CSA were 0.892 and 0.752 in X-rays and MRI respectively; for AI, ICC values were 0.849 and 0.685. All individual analysis reached statistical power ( p  < 0.001). Mean difference for AI values measured in X-rays and in MRI was 0.01 and 0.03 for observers 1 and 2, respectively. Mean difference for CSA values obtained in X-rays and MRI was 0.16 and 0.58 for observers 1 and 2, respectively. Conclusion  Both MRI and X-rays provided high intra- and interobserver agreement for measurement of AI and CSA. Absolute values found for AI and CSA were highly correlated in both image modalities. These findings suggest that MRI is a suitable method to measure AI and CSA. Level of Evidence II , Diagnostic Study.",

      "abstract": "Objective: This cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the correlation between the necrotic index and the modified necrotic index with the Harris hip score (HHS), as well as to assess their interobserver and intraobserver reliability in patients with osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). Methods: Fifty-four adult patients (88 hips) presenting with atraumatic hip pain and radiographic evidence of ONFH (Ficat-Arlet grades 1 and 2) were included. Participants abstained from analgesics for one week prior to the study. All underwent MRI, and HHS was calculated by a resident uninvolved in the study. The necrotic index was determined using angles obtained from mid-coronal and mid-sagittal MRI slices, whereas the modified necrotic index was derived from angles measured in MRI slices where the necrotic lesion appeared at its largest size. Three senior consultants performed measurements on two separate occasions to assess reliability. Results: Both indices showed significant negative correlations with HHS. The modified necrotic index demonstrated a strong correlation (r = -0.940, p < 0.001), whereas the original necrotic index exhibited a moderate correlation (r = -0.790, p < 0.001). The interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for assessment of lesion size was significant for both indices (p < 0.05), but it was higher for the modified index (ICC = 0.81) compared to the original index (ICC = 0.69). Levene’s test for homogeneity of variance indicated unequal variance across the two methods (p < 0.01). Measurement variance was smaller for the modified index than for the original index (p < 0.01), indicating greater precision. Both methods showed significant interobserver and intraobserver agreement (p < 0.05) Conclusion: Both the necrotic index and the modified necrotic index showed significant negative correlations with HHS. The modified necrotic index demonstrated a strong correlation, whereas the original necrotic index exhibited a moderate correlation. Both methods proved reliable for measuring lesion size, with the modified method showing greater precision. Additionally, both indices demonstrated significant interobserver and intraobserver reliability.",

      "abstract": "Background and Aim: The optimal imaging test for gross tumor volume (GTV) delineation in non-spine bone metastases has not been defined. The use of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) requires accurate target delineation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or 18fludesoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18FDG-PET) allow for better visualization of the extent of bone metastases and optimizes the accuracy of tumor delineation for stereotactic radiotherapy compared to computed tomography (CT) alone. We evaluated the interobserver agreement in GTV of non-spine bone metastases in a single center and compared MRI and/or 18FDG-PET and CT in GTV delineation. Methods: Anonymous CT and MRI and/or 18FDG-PET obtained from 10 non-spine bone metastases were analyzed by six radiation oncologists at our center. Images acquired by CT and MRI and/or 18FDG-PET were used to delineate 10 GTVs of non-spine bone metastases in the pelvis, extremities, and skull. The cases showed different characteristics: blastic and lytic metastases, and different primary cancers (lung, breast, prostate, rectum, urothelial, and biliary). In both CT and MRI and/or 18FDG-PET, the GTV volumes were compared. The index of agreement was evaluated according to Landis and Koch protocol. Results: The GTV volume as defined on MRI was in all cases larger or at least as large as the GTV volume on CT (P=0.25). The median GTV volume on MRI was 3.15 cc (0.027-70.64 cc) compared to 2.8 cc on CT (0.075-77.95 cc). Interobserver variance and standard deviation were lower in CT than MRI (576.3 vs. 722.2 and 24.0 vs. 26.9, respectively). The level of agreement was fair (kappa=0.36) between CT and MRI. The median GTV volume on 18FDG-PET in five patients was 5.8 cc (0.46-64.17 cc), compared to 4.1 cc on CT (0.99-54.2 cc) (P=0.236). Interobserver variance and standard deviation in CT, MRI, and 18FDG-PET were 576.3 versus 722.2 versus 730.5 and 24 versus 26.9 versus 27.0, respectively. The level of agreement was slight (kappa=0.08) between CT and 18FDG-PET. Conclusions: Interobserver variance in non-spine bone metastases was equal when MRI and PET were compared to CT. CT was associated with the lowest variance and standard deviation. Compared to CT GTVs, the GTVs rendered from MRI images had fair agreement, while the GTVs rendered from 18FDG-PET had only slight agreement. Relevance for Patients: The delimitation of the treatment volume in non-spine bone metastases with SBRT is important for the results determining its efficacy. It is therefore essential to know the variability and to manage it to achieve the highest quality of treatment.",

Recent data indicate promising short-term efficacy of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cell (bmMSC) therapy. The aim of this case series is to gather more information on the long-term effectiveness and safety.<h4>Methods</h4>Between 2013 and 2017, bmMSCs were administered under compassionate use to patients at a university hospital in Germany, as no stem cell therapy was approved at the time. Inclusion criteria were inactive CD (Harvey-Bradshaw Index <5) without proctitis, at least one treatment-refractory perianal fistula (with or without rectovaginal additional fistulas) and prior tumour necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor and/or surgical exposure. After curettage of the fistula tract, patients received repeated intrafistular injections with up to 300 million bmMSCs. We retrospectively analysed patient records to assess disease course, clinical fistula remission and radiological activity using the modified van Assche index.<h4>Results</h4>Six female patients with a total of 13 fistulas (9 trans-sphincteric, 2 extrasphincteric and 2 rectovaginal) underwent bmMSC application. Median radiological and clinical long-term follow-up was 80 months (range 44-98 months) after first local bmMSC injection. 8 of 13 fistulas (62%) exhibited complete closure. For rectovaginal fistulas, long-term remission (98 months) was 50% (1 of 2). Pelvic MRI showed a decrease in modified Van Assche index from baseline to long-term follow-up. No immediate adverse events related to bmMSC injections were observed. One patient was diagnosed with a local adenocarcinoma of the rectum 106 months after first bmMSC injection. MRI control 11 months prior showed complete fistula remission. The tumour exhibited a female karyotype, while bmMSC had been derived from a male volunteer.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In this analysis, 62% of complex perianal and 50% of rectovaginal fistulas showed long-term remission up to 8 years post-bmMSC therapy.

However, there is a surprising paucity of studies to date that have sought to identify the prevalence and risk factors of depression associated with PFCD.<h4>Aim</h4>To estimate the prevalence of depressive symptoms and investigate the depression-related risk factors in patients with PFCD.<h4>Methods</h4>The study was conducted in the form of survey and clinical data collection <i>via</i> questionnaire and specialized medical staff. Depressive symptoms, life quality, and fatigue severity of patients with PFCD were assessed by Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patient Quality of Life Questionnaire (IBDQ), and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Fatigue Patient Self-assessment Scale. The basic demographic information, overall disease features, perianal clinical information, and laboratory inflammation indicators were also gathered. Multivariate regression analysis was ultimately used to ascertain the risk factors of depression associated with PFCD.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 123 patients with PFCD were involved, and 56.91% were suffering from depression. According to multivariate logistic regression analysis, Perianal Disease Activity Index (PDAI) score [odds ratio (OR) = 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.50 to 0.95], IBDQ score (OR = 0.93, 95%CI: 0.88 to 0.97), modified Van Assche index (OR = 1.24, 95%CI: 1.01 to 1.53), and IBD Fatigue score (OR = 1.72, 95%CI: 1.23 to 2.42) were independent risk factors of depression-related prevalence among patients with PFCD (<i>P</i> < 0.05).

We evaluated the feasibility of volumetric measurement of terminal ileal CD on MRE compared to endoscopy and sMARIA, and the responsiveness of volumetric changes to biologics.<h4>Methods</h4>CD patients with MRE and contemporaneous CD endoscopic index of severity-scored ileocolonoscopy were included. A centreline was placed through the terminal ileum (TI) lumen defining the diseased bowel length on the T2-weighted non-fat saturated sequence, used by two radiologists to independently segment the bowel wall to measure volume (phase 1). In phase 2, we measured disease volume in patients treated with biologics, who had undergone pre- and post-treatment MRE, with treatment response classified via global physician assessment.<h4>Results</h4>Phase 1 comprised 30 patients (median age 29 (IQR 24, 34) years). Phase 2 included 12 patients (25 years (22, 38)). In phase 1, the mean of the radiologist-measured volumes was used for analysis. The median disease volume in those with endoscopically active CD was 20.9 cm<sup>3</sup> (IQR 11.3, 44.0) compared to 5.7 cm<sup>3</sup> (2.9, 9.8) with normal endoscopy. The mean difference in disease volume between the radiologists was 3.0 cm<sup>3</sup> (limits of agreement -21.8, 15.9). The median disease volume of patients with active CD by sMARIA was 15.0 cm<sup>3</sup> (8.7, 44.0) compared to 2.85 cm<sup>3</sup> (2.6, 3.1) for those with inactive CD.

Clinical, radiomics, and combined models were constructed using eight machine learning algorithms with 5-fold cross-validation.ResultsAge and vertebral CT Hounsfield units were significant clinical predictors. From 3668 initial features, 16 key radiomics features were selected. LightGBM performed best for clinical models, while k-nearest neighbors excelled for radiomics models.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered the reference standard, but endoanal ultrasound (EAUS) with high-frequency 360° probes provide a readily available, cost-effective, and repeatable alternative. <b>Methods</b>: We performed a narrative review of the literature, evaluating studies on the EAUS technique, diagnostic applications, distinguishing features of Crohn's-related fistulas, and comparative analyses with MRI. Consensus documents and structured reporting initiatives were also included. <b>Results</b>: EAUS provides high-resolution visualization of the anal sphincter complex and intersphincteric space, enabling the reliable detection of fistulas and abscesses. Characteristic features such as tract width > 4 mm, bifurcation, hyperechoic debris, the Crohn's Ultrasound Fistula Sign (CUFS), and the rosary sign assist in differentiating Crohn's from cryptoglandular fistulas. EAUS is well-suited for serial monitoring, perioperative seton guidance, and therapeutic decision-making. Emerging tools such as Doppler and shear wave elastography provide additional information on activity and fibrosis. MRI remains indispensable for supralevator disease, deep pelvic sepsis, and standardized activity indices. Comparative studies indicate similar sensitivity for simple fistulas, with MRI superior in complex cases; combining both modalities maximizes accuracy. <b>Conclusions</b>: EAUS is a practical and repeatable imaging tool that complements MRI in the multidisciplinary management of perianal Crohn's disease. Advances such as 3D imaging, contrast enhancement, and elastography may enable validated activity scoring-for example, a future PEACE (Perianal Endosonographic Activity in Chron's Evaluation) Index-further strengthening its role in longitudinal care.",

CF wrapping angle was analyzed on the most affected bowel segment and was independently evaluated by IUS and CTE. We evaluated the wrapping angle of CF in the cross- and vertical sections of the diseased bowel. CF wrapping angle was divided into < 180° and ≥ 180°. IUS performance was assessed using CTE as a reference standard, and IUS interobserver consistency was evaluated.<h4>Results</h4>We enrolled 96 patients.

Excellent agreement was shown between US and CTE (82/93, 88.2%). The eleven remaining cases showed inconsistencies mostly in the terminal ileum (n = 5) and small intestine (n = 4). Total agreement between IUS observers was 89.6% (86/96, κ = 0.839, p = 0.000), with perfect agreement for the ileocecal and colonic segments (35/37, 94.6% and 20/21, 95.2%, respectively) and moderate agreement for small intestinal segments (16/21, 76.2%).<h4>Conclusions</h4>IUS could be of value and complementary to CTE for assessing CF, particularly in patients with affected terminal ileum and colon. IUS is a non-invasive technique for monitoring CD patients.<h4>Critical relevance statement</h4>In our study, excellent agreement was shown between intestinal US observers as well as between US and CT enterography (CTE) for assessing creeping fat (CF), which showed that ultrasound could be of value and complementary to CTE.<h4>Key points</h4>Creeping fat (CF) is a potential therapeutic target in Crohn's disease.

Across the UK, the demand for colonoscopy is outstripping capacity and the diagnosis of colorectal disease is being delayed. A colon capsule endoscope (CCE) is an alternative colorectal diagnostic. It is a 'camera in a pill' that can be swallowed and which passes through the gastrointestinal tract, obtaining visual images on the colon. There is now established experience of CCE in the UK. CCE might provide a less invasive method to diagnose colorectal disease if found to be accurate and effective and provide a means by which to increase the National Health Service (NHS) diagnostic capacity.<h4>Aims and objectives</h4>The aim of this study is to determine the diagnostic accuracy of CCE when compared with colonoscopy in representative and clinically meaningful cohorts of patients. An evaluation of the experiences of CCE for the patient and clinical team and an assessment of cost effectiveness will be undertaken.<h4>Methods</h4>We will undertake three research workstreams (WS). In WS1, we shall perform a paired (back-to-back) study. Each participant will swallow the CCE and then later on the same day they will have a colonoscopy. The study has been designed in collaboration with our Patient Advisory Group and as closely mirrors standard care as is possible. 973 participants will be recruited from three representative clinical contexts; suspected CRC, suspected inflammatory bowel disease and postpolypectomy surveillance. Up to 30 sites across the UK will be involved to maximise inclusivity. Measures of diagnostic accuracy will be reported along with CCE completion rates, number of colonoscopy procedures potentially prevented and adverse events, such as capsule retention. A nested substudy of intraobserver and interobserver agreement will be performed. WS2 will develop models of cost-effectiveness and WS3 will evaluate the patient and clinician experience, with reference to acceptability and choice.<h4>Anticipated impact</h4>The study findings will provide the evidence base to inform future colorectal diagnostic services.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>The study has approval from the North East-Tyne and Wear South research ethics committee (REC reference 24/NE/0178, IRAS 331349). The findings will be disseminated to the NHS, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, other clinical stakeholders and participants, patients and the public.<h4>Trial registration number</h4>ISRCTN16126290.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Purpose</h4>This study constructs a predictive model for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) refractoriness using a machine learning (ML) algorithm and verifies the predictive performance of different algorithms.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of 131 patients (48 with TACE refractoriness) who underwent repeated TACE treatment for HCC were retrospectively collected. The training and validation cohorts comprised 104 and 27 cases, respectively, following an 8:2 ratio. Clinical imaging characteristics related to TACE refractoriness were identified through logistic regression analysis. HCC lesions on arterial phase, portal phase, delayed phase, and T2-weighted fat suppression MRI images before the first TACE were manually delineated as regions of interest. Dimension reduction was conducted using variance threshold, univariate selection, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator methods. Relevant indices of TACE refractoriness were selected. ML algorithms, including a support vector machine, random forest, logistic regression and adaptive boosting, were used to construct the radiomics, clinical prediction, and combined models. The predictive performance of these models was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves. The optimal model was presented as a nomogram and verified through calibration and decision curve analyses.<h4>Results</h4>In evaluating radiomics models for predicting TACE refractoriness in HCC, the LR-developed portal venous phase (VP) model achieved optimal single-sequence performance (training AUC: 0.896, 95% CI: 0.843-0.941; validation: 0.853, 0.727-0.965). Multisequence models significantly surpassed single-sequence counterparts, with the T2WI-FS+AP+VP+DP multisequence LR model demonstrating peak efficacy (training: 0.905, 0.853-0.949; validation: 0.876, 0.773-0.976). The integrated clinical-radiomics model demonstrated robust predictive performance, achieving a training cohort AUC of 0.955 (95% CI: 0.918-0.984) with 0.885 accuracy, 0.921 sensitivity, and 0.864 specificity, and maintained strong validation performance (AUC=0.941, 95% CI: 0.880-0.991).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Multisequence clinical-radiomics model accurately predicts TACE refractoriness in hepatocellular carcinoma.",

Higher infliximab trough levels (TLIs) may improve fistula healing rates; however, it remains unclear whether escalating infliximab therapy to meet higher TLI targets using proactive, or routine, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) improves outcomes. This randomised controlled trial aimed to assess whether infliximab therapy targeting higher TLIs guided by proactive TDM improves outcomes compared with standard therapy.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>Patients with active pfCD will be randomised 1:1 to either the proactive TDM arm or standard dosing arm and followed up for 54 weeks. Patients in the proactive TDM arm will have infliximab dosing optimised to target higher TLIs. The targets will be TLI ≥ 25 µg/mL at week 2, ≥ 20 µg/mL at week 6 and ≥ 10 µg/mL during maintenance therapy. The primary objective will be fistula healing at week 32. Secondary objectives will include fistula healing, fistula closure, radiological fistula healing, patient-reported outcomes and economic costs up to 54 weeks. Patients in the standard dosing arm will receive conventional infliximab dosing not guided by TLIs (5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2 and 6, and 5 mg/kg 8 weekly thereafter). Patients aged 18-80 years with pfCD with single or multiple externally draining complex perianal fistulas who are relatively naïve to infliximab treatment will be included. Patients with diverting ileostomies or colostomies and pregnant or breast feeding will be excluded. Fifty-eight patients per arm will be required to detect a 25% difference in the primary outcome measure, with 138 patients needed to account for an estimated 6.1% primary non-response rate and 10% dropout rate.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>Results will be presented in peer-reviewed journals and international conferences.

      "abstract": "<h4>Purpose</h4>Complex anal fistulas can recur after clinical healing, even after a long interval which leads to significant anxiety. Also, ascertaining the efficacy of any new treatment procedure becomes difficult and takes several years. We prospectively analyzed the validity of Garg scoring system (GSS) to predict long-term fistula healing.<h4>Methods</h4>In patients operated for cryptoglandular anal fistulas, magnetic resonance imaging was performed preoperatively and at 3 months postoperatively to assess fistula healing. Scores as per the GSS were calculated for each patient at 3 months postoperatively and correlated with long-term healing to check the accuracy of the scoring system.<h4>Results</h4>Fifty-seven patients were enrolled, but 50 were finally included (7 were excluded). These 50 patients (age, 41.2±12.4 years; 46 men) were followed up for 12 to 20 months (median, 17 months). Forty-seven patients (94.0%) had complex fistulas, 28 (56.0%) had recurrent fistulas, 48 (96.0%) had multiple tracts, 20 (40.0%) had horseshoe tracts, 15 (32.0%) had associated abscesses, 5 (10.0%) were suprasphincteric, and 8 (16.0%) were supralevator fistulas. The GSS could accurately predict long-term healing (high positive predictive value, 31 of 31 [100%]) but was not very accurate in predicting nonhealing (negative predictive value, 15 of 19 [78.9%]). The sensitivity in predicting healing was 31 of 35 (88.6%).<h4>Conclusion</h4>GSS accurately predicts long-term fistula with a high positive predictive value (100%) but is less accurate in predicting nonhealing. This scoring system can help allay anxiety in patients and facilitate the early validation of innovative procedures for anal fistulas.",

      "abstract": "Breast density, which is the ratio between fibroglandular tissue (FGT) and total breast volume, can be assessed qualitatively by radiologists and quantitatively by computer algorithms. These algorithms often rely on segmentation of breast and FGT volume. In this study, we propose a method to directly assess breast density on MRI, and provide interpretations of these assessments.   We assessed breast density in 506 patients with breast cancer using a regression convolutional neural network (CNN). The input for the CNN were slices of breast MRI of 128 x 128 voxels, and the output was a continuous density value between 0 (fatty breast) and 1 (dense breast). We used 350 patients to train the CNN, 75 for validation, and 81 for independent testing. We investigated why the CNN came to its predicted density using Deep SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP).   The density predicted by the CNN on the testing set was significantly correlated with the ground truth densities (N = 81 patients, Spearman's rho = 0.86, P < 0.001). When inspecting what the CNN based its predictions on, we found that voxels in FGT commonly had positive SHAP-values, voxels in fatty tissue commonly had negative SHAP-values, and voxels in non-breast tissue commonly had SHAP-values near zero. This means that the prediction of density is based on the structures we expect it to be based on, namely FGT and fatty tissue.   To conclude, we presented an interpretable deep learning regression method for breast density estimation on MRI with promising results.",

Predicting response or remission (RoR) for individual patients is difficult and complicates treatment strategy. We aimed to determine if motility magnetic resonance imaging (mMRI) is superior to CRP and fecal calprotectin (FC) for the prediction of RoR at 1 year in patients commencing biologics for SBCD.<h4>Methods</h4>Prospective, multicenter (n = 13) cohort study of patients with active non-stricturing SBCD requiring anti-TNFα or anti-IL-12/23 treatment. We measured mMRI and CRP at baseline and post-induction (visit 2: 12-30 weeks), and FC in a subset. RoR was assessed at 1 year using clinical and structural magnetic resonance enterography parameters. We compared sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of changes in mMRI and CRP to predict RoR at 1 year. Secondary outcomes compared mMRI with FC, and prediction of improved quality of life (QoL).<h4>Results</h4>Eighty-six participants completed all assessments. Stable or improved mMRI at visit 2 was more sensitive than normalization of CRP for RoR (mMRI:71.0%, 95%CI 52.0-85.8; CRP:45.2%, 95%CI 27.3-64.0%, P = .008) but less specific (mMRI:30.9%, 95%CI 19.1-44.8; CRP:67.3%, 95%CI 53.3-79.3%, P < .001). There was no significant difference in ROC-AUC (mMRI:0.48; CRP:0.53, P = .65). Similar results were obtained for FC. None of mMRI, CRP, or FC predicted patient QoL at 1 year.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Although improved mMRI is more sensitive than CRP and FC to predict RoR at 1 year, it is less specific. No factor predicted patient QoL. Motility MRI remains a marker of disease activity at given timepoints.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Crohn's disease (CD)-associated perianal fistulas are a challenging and debilitating complication, often resistant to standard medical and surgical treatments. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy, particularly using adipose- or bone marrow-derived MSCs (AMSCs/BM-MSCs), offers a promising regenerative approach, yet data on autologous BM-MSCs remain limited. Objective This pilot study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of autologous BM-MSCs in treating perianal fistulas in CD patients, and to identify potential predictive factors influencing treatment outcomes. Methods A single-center, prospective, single-blind randomized study was conducted over six months at Mohammed VI University Hospital in Marrakech, Morocco. Twenty CD patients with complex perianal fistulas unresponsive to conventional therapy were enrolled, of whom eight completed the 24-week follow-up. Patients were randomized into two groups: local BM-MSC administration only (CroMaPCs) and combined local plus intravenous administration (CroMaPCs+). Outcomes were assessed clinically and radiologically at Weeks 2, 6, and 24. Results At 24 weeks, complete fistula healing was observed in three patients (37.5%), with higher response and healing rates in the CroMaPCs+ group (50%) compared to the CroMaPCs group (25%). No treatment-related adverse events were reported. Factors such as age, immunosuppressive therapy, and combined BM-MSC intravenous administration may have influenced outcomes, although the small sample size limits definitive conclusions. Conclusion Autologous BM-MSC therapy appears safe and potentially effective in managing refractory perianal fistulas in CD. Combined local and systemic administration may enhance healing. Larger, controlled trials are needed to validate these findings and refine patient selection and treatment protocols.",

Progresses in deep learning (DL) methods have resulted in significant performance enhancement in tasks related to anatomical landmark detection.

Understanding how inter-rater variability impacts the performance and reliability of the resulting DL algorithms, which are crucial for clinical deployment, can inform the improvement of training data construction and boost DL models' outcomes. In this paper, we conducted a thorough study of different annotation-fusion strategies to preserve inter-rater variability in DL models for anatomical landmark detection, aiming to boost the performance and reliability of the resulting algorithms. Additionally, we explored the characteristics and reliability of four metrics, including a novel Weighted Coordinate Variance metric to quantify landmark detection uncertainty/inter-rater variability.

Training deep learning networks with annotations from multiple raters is a common practice that mitigates the model's bias towards a single expert. Reliable models generating calibrated outputs and reflecting the inter-rater disagreement are key to the integration of artificial intelligence in clinical practice. Various methods exist to take into account different expert labels. We focus on comparing three label fusion methods: STAPLE, average of the rater's segmentation, and random sampling of each rater's segmentation during training. Each label fusion method is studied using both the conventional training framework and the recently published SoftSeg framework that limits information loss by treating the segmentation task as a regression. Our results, across 10 data splittings on two public datasets, indicate that SoftSeg models, regardless of the ground truth fusion method, had better calibration and preservation of the inter-rater rater variability compared with their conventional counterparts without impacting the segmentation performance. Conventional models, i.e., trained with a Dice loss, with binary inputs, and sigmoid/softmax final activate, were overconfident and underestimated the uncertainty associated with inter-rater variability. Conversely, fusing labels by averaging with the SoftSeg framework led to underconfident outputs and overestimation of the rater disagreement. In terms of segmentation performance, the best label fusion method was different for the two datasets studied, indicating this parameter might be task-dependent. However, SoftSeg had segmentation performance systematically superior or equal to the conventionally trained models and had the best calibration and preservation of the inter-rater variability.",

However, applicant selection procedures based on ratings from multiple raters usually result in a binary outcome; the applicant is either selected or not. This final outcome is not considered in IRR, which instead focuses on the ratings of the individual subjects or objects. We outline the connection between the ratings' measurement model (used for IRR) and a binary classification framework. We develop a simple way of approximating the probability of correctly selecting the best applicants which allows us to compute error probabilities of the selection procedure (i.e., false positive and false negative rate) or their lower bounds. We draw connections between the inter-rater reliability and the binary classification metrics, showing that binary classification metrics depend solely on the IRR coefficient and proportion of selected applicants. We assess the performance of the approximation in a simulation study and apply it in an example comparing the reliability of multiple grant peer review selection procedures. We also discuss possible other uses of the explored connections in other contexts, such as educational testing, psychological assessment, and health-related measurement and implement the computations in IRR2FPR R package.",

      "doi": "",
      "abstract": "In recent years, the qualitative research on empirical software engineering that applies Grounded Theory is increasing. Grounded Theory (GT) is a technique for developing theory inductively e iteratively from qualitative data based on theoretical sampling, coding, constant comparison, memoing, and saturation, as main characteristics. Large or controversial GT studies may involve multiple researchers in collaborative coding, which requires a kind of rigor and consensus that an individual coder does not. Although many qualitative researchers reject quantitative measures in favor of other qualitative criteria, many others are committed to measuring consensus through Inter-Rater Reliability (IRR) and/or Inter-Rater Agreement (IRA) techniques to develop a shared understanding of the phenomenon being studied. However, there are no specific guidelines about how and when to apply IRR/IRA during the iterative process of GT, so researchers have been using ad hoc methods for years. This paper presents a process for systematically applying IRR/IRA in GT studies that meets the iterative nature of this qualitative research method, which is supported by a previous systematic literature review on applying IRR/RA in GT studies in software engineering. This process allows researchers to incrementally generate a theory while ensuring consensus on the constructs that support it and, thus, improving the rigor of qualitative research. This formalization helps researchers to apply IRR/IRA to GT studies when various raters are involved in coding. Measuring consensus among raters promotes communicability, transparency, reflexivity, replicability, and trustworthiness of the research.",

This study is concerned with the inter-rater reliability and convergent validity of the peer recommendations formulated in the F1000Prime peer review system. The study is based on around 100,000 papers with recommendations from Faculty members. Even if intersubjectivity plays a fundamental role in science, the analyses of the reliability of the F1000Prime peer review system show a rather low level of agreement between Faculty members. This result is in agreement with most other studies which have been published on the journal peer review system. Logistic regression models are used to investigate the convergent validity of the F1000Prime peer review system. As the results show, the proportion of highly cited papers among those selected by the Faculty members is significantly higher than expected. In addition, better recommendation scores are also connected with better performance of the papers.",

MRE examinations were independently reviewed by three pediatric radiologists who indicated the presence vs. absence of ulcers, ulcer severity (categorical depth), and ulcer extent (categorical number of ulcers). Maximum bowel wall thickness and length of disease were measured and averaged across readers. Patient demographics and clinical inflammatory markers were documented from electronic health records. Inter-radiologist agreement was assessed using Fleiss' kappa (k) statistics. Student's t-test was used to compare continuous variables.<h4>Results</h4>Mean patient age was 13.9 years (67 [62%] boys). Radiologic ulcers were recorded in 64/108 (59.3%) cases by reader 1, 70/108 (64.8%) cases by reader 2, and 49/108 (45.4%) cases by reader 3 (k = 0.36). Based on majority consensus, radiologic ulcers were present in 60/108 (55.6%) participants. Inter-radiologist agreement for ulcer severity was k = 0.23, while ulcer extent was k = 0.66. There were significant differences in C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, fecal calprotectin, albumin, maximum bowel wall thickness, and length of disease between patients without and with radiologic ulcers (P < 0.05). The sensitivity and specificity of MRE for detecting endoscopic ulcers were 66.7% (95% CI, 52.1-79.2%) and 69.2% (95% CI, 48.2-85.7%), respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Radiologic ulcers are visible in children with newly diagnosed ileal CD, although inter-radiologist agreement is only fair. The presence of ulcers is associated with clinical laboratory inflammatory markers as well as other MRE findings of disease activity and is an additional imaging finding that can be used to evaluate intestinal inflammation.",

Cross-sectional imaging is used in conjunction with endoscopy to diagnose and monitor disease and detect complications. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has demonstrable utility in evaluating inflammatory activity. However, subjective interpretation of conventional MR sequences is limited in its ability to fully phenotype the underlying histopathological processes in chronic disease. In particular, conventional MRI can be confounded by the presence of mural fibrosis and muscle hypertrophy, which can mask or sometimes mimic inflammation. Quantitative MRI (qMRI) methods provide a means to better differentiate mural inflammation from fibrosis and improve quantification of these processes. qMRI may also provide more objective measures of disease activity and enable better tailoring of treatment. Here, we review quantitative MRI methods for imaging the small bowel in CD and consider the path to their clinical translation. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 2.",

As predictive tools are lacking, this study aims to develop a clinical-imaging nomogram to assess ATM risk and support precision diagnosis and treatment in PAHSCI.<h4>Methods</h4>We retrospectively analyzed clinical data from patients under 14 years of age diagnosed with thoracic PAHSCI between January 2012 and January 2023. All patients underwent lumbar puncture, gadolinium-enhanced imaging, and whole-spine MRI. Clinical history and imaging findings were collected, and the diagnosis of ATM was determined according to the Transverse Myelitis Consortium Working Group criteria. Patients were randomly assigned to training and validation cohorts in a 7:3 ratio. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to identify potential risk factors for ATM, which were then incorporated into a multivariable logistic regression model to construct a predictive nomogram. Model discrimination and calibration were assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration plots, and Brier scores. Internal validation was performed via 1,000-bootstrap resampling to generate 95% confidence intervals. Model goodness-of-fit was evaluated with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, and clinical utility was assessed using decision curve analysis (DCA).<h4>Results</h4>LASSO regression and multivariate logistic regression identified five predictors: age, fall, latent activity, flow void, and pinprick sensation score, which were used to construct a nomogram for estimating the risk of ATM in PAHSCI patients. The model demonstrated strong discriminative performance, with AUCs of 0.876 (95% CI: 0.803-0.950) in the training set and 0.844 (95% CI: 0.709-0.979) in the validation set.

Decision curve analysis indicated substantial net clinical benefit within risk thresholds of 8%-99% in the training cohort and 6%-71% in the validation cohort.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We developed a preliminary nomogram demonstrating strong predictive accuracy for estimating ATM risk in PAHSCI patients, thereby enabling clinicians to adopt individualized therapeutic strategies.",

      "abstract": "Infected necrotizing pancreatitis (INP) is a severe complication of acute pancreatitis (AP) associated with high morbidity and mortality, yet regional data remain limited. We retrospectively reviewed 119 patients admitted with AP to the King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, between 2017 and 2025 to characterize risk factors, microbiological profiles, and management strategies. Of these patients, 21 (17.6%) developed INP. Compared with patients with noninfected AP, they were older (mean 60.1 ± 11.2 years, <i>p</i> < 0.05), were more frequently overweight or obese (85.7% ≥ 25 kg/m², <i>p</i> = 0.03), and had higher severity scores (Bedside Index for Severity in Acute Pancreatitis ≥3 in 61.9%, <i>p</i> < 0.01). These baseline differences could explain outcomes rather than infection status. Gallstones (42.9%) and exposure to glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (4.8%) were associated with INP. Radiologic imaging confirmed necrosis in all cases, including five abscesses. Of the 21 INP cases, 19 were confirmed by positive cultures from fine-needle aspiration (FNA), drainage, or necrosectomy and 2 by imaging (gas in necrotic collections) plus blood cultures. Microbiological cultures obtained from FNA, drainage, or necrosectomy most commonly identified <i>Escherichia coli</i> (42.9%) and <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> (23.8%), with multidrug resistance detected in one-third of cases. Management strategies included conservative therapy (<i>n</i> = 8), percutaneous drainage (<i>n</i> = 4), endoscopic necrosectomy (<i>n</i> = 5), and surgical necrosectomy (<i>n</i> = 4). Complications included pancreatic fistula, colonic perforation, and sepsis, with an overall mortality rate of 9.5%. Antibiotics were culture-directed in INP but frequently used prophylactically in severe noninfected AP. Early enteral nutrition was implemented in most infected cases. These preliminary findings-limited by a small sample size, single-center design, and a bias toward severe cases-require validation in larger studies; nevertheless, they suggest that older age, obesity, severe presentation, and multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae are defining features of INP in this cohort, and they underscore the importance of antibiotic stewardship and early nutritional support in regional clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Purpose</h4>Cumulative bowel damage (BD) critically influences the progression and prognosis of Crohn's disease (CD). Although the Lémann Index (LI) remains the standard for BD assessment, its clinical utility is limited by heavy reliance on extensive clinical data. Multiparametric magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) provides noninvasive macroscopic evaluation of BD severity, however, it fails to characterize microscopic alterations. We therefore integrated MRE with gut microbiome and metabolomic data to uncover mechanistic insights and develop a comprehensive model for better prediction of BD.<h4>Methods and results</h4>In this prospective two-center study, 309 CD patients were stratified into BD and non-BD groups using LI. Patients underwent MRE, fecal 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and fecal/serum metabolomic analysis. Thirty healthy controls were included for comparison. The relationships between microbial/metabolic factors and MRE features were explored using correlation and mediation analyses. Seven machine learning algorithms, each paired with seven distinct combinations of multi-omics features, were evaluated using nested 5-fold cross-validation to construct an optimal prediction model. BD patients exhibited reduced gut microbial diversity (<i>P</i><0.05), with <i>Erysipelatoclostridium</i> and <i>[Ruminococcus]_gnavus_group</i> as key discriminators. Metabolomics revealed elevated fecal aromatic amino acids and depleted serum glycerophospholipids/sphingolipids (<i>P</i><0.05) linked to MRE-quantified features through mediation by microbial pathways (eg, 22.8% mediation effect of <i>Prevotella_9</i> on penetration, <i>P</i> <sub>ACME</sub>=0.022). The optimal Xtreme Gradient Boosting Classifier (XGBC) model integrating three microbial genera, six fecal metabolites, three serum metabolites, and three MRE features achieved superior performance (AUC 0.857 and 0.829 in the derivation and external validation cohorts, respectively). SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis prioritized perianal diseases, <i>Erysipelatoclostridium</i>, and fecal alanine as key contributors.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our study underscores the interplay between gut microbial dysbiosis, metabolic alterations, and MRE-quantified structural changes in BD patients. The integrated multi-omics model provides a promising tool for BD prediction, enabling precise CD severity stratification and personalized clinical decision-making.",

Their interaction with stem cells (SCs), which naturally secrete regenerative factors, further enhances their therapeutic potential. In particular, the use of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and exosome-enriched mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) preparations has been explored for treating gastrointestinal (GI) fistulas associated with Crohn's disease (CD), a debilitating form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Preclinical studies, clinical trials, and systematic reviews have evaluated the safety and efficacy of these approaches, with ADSCs-commercially available as Darvadstrocel-emerging as one of the most promising options. While notable progress has been made in both experimental and clinical research, the overall effectiveness of exosomes and stem cell-based therapies is still an area of active investigation. Further studies are needed to develop optimized, innovative treatments with minimal adverse effects. Given the substantial morbidity and healthcare burden associated with IBD-related fistulas, there is a critical need to find cost-effective, accessible, and reliable therapeutic options and strategies. Critically, none of these innovations will reach patients without regulatory convergence or cost-effectiveness data. Exosome therapies still lack a dedicated approval pathway, and GMP-scale purification is still confined to a handful of facilities, driving prices beyond current reimbursement limits. Future phase III trials must therefore embed economic modeling and adopt composite end points that link molecular engagement to MRI-verified fistula healing and patient-reported outcomes.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Crohn's disease is a chronic, relapsing form of inflammatory bowel disease marked by severe gastrointestinal inflammation and a broad range of debilitating symptoms. Despite advances in medical treatments, achieving sustained remission remains challenging for many patients. This umbrella review aims to consolidate evidence from various systematic reviews to evaluate the efficacy and safety of stem cell therapies in treating Crohn's disease.<h4>Methods</h4>This review followed the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology and adhered to PRISMA guidelines. A literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library covered records up to 20 April 2024. Only systematic reviews and meta-analyses on stem cell therapy for Crohn's disease were considered. Data were extracted and analyzed for clinical efficacy indicators like remission induction and safety metrics, including adverse events and mortality rates.<h4>Results</h4>Sixteen systematic reviews were included, spanning studies conducted between 2009 and 2023. Stem cell therapy showed a pooled risk ratio (RR) of 1.299 (95% CI: 1.192-1.420) for clinical remission, indicating a 29.9% increased likelihood of remission compared to controls. The pooled RR for healing perianal Crohn's disease was 1.358 (95% CI: 1.13-1.631), suggesting a 35.8% increased likelihood of healing. A pooled RR of 1.481 (95% CI: 1.036-2.116) shows a 48.1% higher immediate fistula closure rate with stem cell therapy. For long-term outcomes, a RR of 1.422 (95% CI: 1.091-1.854) indicates a 42.2% increased likelihood of maintaining closure. However, stem cell therapy did not significantly impact Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) (RR: 1.154, 95% CI: 0.193-6.883) and Perianal Disease Activity Index (PDAI) scores (mean difference at 12 weeks: -0.505, 95% CI: -2.481 to 1.471; mean difference at 24 weeks: -0.338, 95% CI: -1.638 to 0.963). The safety profile was comparable to conventional therapies, with a pooled RR of 0.972 (95% CI: 0.739-1.278) for adverse events and 1.136 (95% CI: 0.821-1.572) for serious adverse events.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Stem cell therapy offers significant progress in treating Crohn's disease, particularly in complex cases, by improving fistula closure rates and suggesting potential as a supplementary therapy. Its safety profile aligns with conventional treatments, yet ongoing clinical trials are crucial to optimize its use. Continual research will enable healthcare providers to tailor more effective treatment strategies for this challenging condition.",

      "abstract": "A retrospective analysis was conducted to investigate how a bright luminal sign on high b-value diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) could be considered as a new biomarker for identifying fibrotic strictures in Crohn's disease (CD). Fibrotic strictures, due to excessive deposition of extracellular matrix following chronic inflammatory processes, can be difficult to distinguish from inflammatory strictures using endoscopy. This study was performed on 65 patients with CD who underwent MRE, and among them 32 patients showed the bright luminal sign on high b-value DWI. DWI findings were compared to pre- and post-contrast MRE data. Luminal bright sign performance results were calculated using a confusion matrix, the relationship between categorical variables was assessed by the χ2 test of independence, and the Kruskal-Wallis test (ANOVA) was used for the assessment of statistical significance of differences between groups. The results indicated a high sensitivity (90%) and specificity (85%) of the bright luminal sign for fibro-stenotic CD and a significant correlation between DWI luminal brightness and markers such as the homogeneous enhancement pattern (<i>p</i> < 0.001), increase in enhancement percentage from 70 s to 7 min after gadolinium injection (<i>p</i> < 0.001), and submucosal fat penetration (<i>p</i> = 0.05). These findings indicate that DWI hyperintensity can be considered as a good non-invasive indicator for the detection of severe intestinal fibrosis and may provide an efficient and accurate method for assessing fibrotic strictures. This new non-invasive biomarker could allow an early diagnosis of fibrotic stricture, delaying the onset of complications and subsequent surgery. Moreover, further evaluations through larger prospective trials with histopathological correlation are needed to confirm these results and completely determine the clinical benefits of DWI in treating CD.",

Combined remission, defined as clinical remission and absence of collections >2 cm confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging, was reported in 60.6% and in 69.7% of patients at months 6 and 12, respectively. The rate of patients with treatment failure, defined as no clinical remission at the last follow-up (mean 18.7 months; SD 9.9), was 34.5%. Failure rate was independent of follow-up time (p = 0.85).

These mpRadiomic methods could potentially provide a platform for stratification of tumor grade as well as assessment of treatment response in brain tumors. In brain, multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) are based on contrast enhanced T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), T2WI, Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR), Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) and Perfusion Weighted Imaging (PWI). Therefore, we applied our multiparametric radiomic framework (mpRadiomic) on 24 patients with brain tumors (8 grade II and 16 grade IV). The mpRadiomic framework classified grade IV tumors from grade II tumors with a sensitivity and specificity of 93% and 100%, respectively, with an AUC of 0.95. For treatment response, the mpRadiomic framework classified pseudo-progression from true-progression with an AUC of 0.93.

Stage C, healed disease, focused on proactive care maintenance. Sixty patients were sequentially enrolled and prospectively followed for ≥12 months. Endpoints included clinical healing and radiologic remission in those with clinically active fistulas, and relapse in those with healed fistulas.<h4>Results</h4>At baseline, 52% (n = 31) and 48% (n = 29) had clinically active and healed fistulas, respectively. For patients with clinically active fistulas, 71% achieved clinical healing after 22 months, with estimated healing rates of 39% and 84% at 1 and 2 years, respectively. Radiologic remission was achieved in 25%, significantly higher than baseline inclusion rates of 6%. For patients with healed fistulas, 7% experienced clinical relapse after 23 months, with no significant change in radiologic remission, 80% versus 86% at baseline.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A protocolized treatment strategy proactively optimizing care resulted in high rates of clinical healing and improved radiologic remission of Crohn's perianal fistulas. Controlled-matched studies are needed.",

This study aimed to assess the long-term outcomes in patients with pCD treated with autologous PRS injection.<h4>Methods</h4>Adult patients with therapy-refractory pCD (failure to anti-tumor necrosis factor [TNF] therapy and/or fistula surgery), who underwent fistula curettage, closure of the internal fistula orifice, and autologous PRS injection in a Dutch tertiary referral center were included in an earlier conducted pilot study (n = 25). The primary outcome was complete clinical closure at long-term follow-up (closure of all treated external opening[s]). Secondary outcomes were partial clinical closure (closure of ≥1 treated external opening[s]), radiologic healing (fibrotic fistula tract on magnetic resonance imaging), and recurrence.<h4>Results</h4>The majority of the patients were female (56%) (mean age 34.4 years [standard deviation - SD: 0.9], and mean follow-up 3.7 years [SD: 0.6]). The treatment-refractory character of the study cohort was displayed by the high rate of patients with ≥1 external opening (60%), prior exposure to an anti-TNF agent (92%), TOpClass classification system ≥ class 2b (36%), and the low rate of patients who underwent prior surgical interventions aimed at fistula closure (12%). During long-term follow-up, complete clinical closure was achieved in 88%. Partial clinical closure was achieved in all patients. Radiologic healing was achieved in 75% of the patients. Recurrence was reported in 8% of the patients who achieved prior clinical closure. No recurrences were observed in patients with radiologic healing. Seventeen unplanned re-interventions were reported in nine patients (36%), predominantly for residual fistulizing disease and in patients with severe therapy-refractory pCD (TOpClass classification system ≥ class 2b) at the time of inclusion.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Additional PRS injection, fistula curettage, and closure of the internal orifice is a promising therapy for patients with (treatment-refractory) pCD and could improve clinical and radiologic healing rates. In addition, low recurrence rates were observed. Future randomized research is warranted in order to assess the effectiveness and positioning of PRS in the field of pCD.<h4>Clinical trial registration</h4>NL8417.",

Both intraindividual paired (n = 20) and independent group analyses (n = 13) were performed. Setons were categorized by configuration (O-shaped vs. V-shaped), thickness (1.5 mm vs. 2.5 mm), and laxity (≤ 2 cm vs. > 2 cm from the anal verge). Patient-reported outcomes were assessed using structured questionnaires evaluating sitting discomfort, discharge, sexual impact, and fecal incontinence.<h4>Results</h4>O-shaped setons caused significantly less sitting discomfort than V-shaped ones (50.0% vs. 80.0%, p = 0.021). Excess laxity (> 2 cm) was associated with increased discharge (86.4% vs. 51.6%, p = 0.008), sexual impact (42.1% vs. 10.3%, p = 0.016), and fecal incontinence (66.7% vs. 10.0%, p = 0.041). Thicker setons (2.5 mm) showed a non-significant trend toward more pain (42.9% vs. 17.9%, p = 0.080).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Seton configuration and laxity significantly affect patient comfort.

The most commonly used sphincter-saving procedures are ligation of the inter-sphincteric fistula tract (LIFT) and mucosal advancement flap (MAF). We aimed to evaluate the incidence and risk factors for recurrence and incontinence in elderly patients with TPAF using both approaches.<h4>Methods</h4>This retrospective study included 257 patients who underwent LIFT (136 patients) or MAF (121 patients) for de novo and cryptoglandular TPAF between July 2018 and July 2021. Recurrent fistulas were clinically and radiologically detected using MRI. Postoperative incontinence was evaluated using the Wexner score and anorectal manometry. Logistic regression analysis was used to detect the risks of recurrence and incontinence.<h4>Results</h4>The median ages of the patients were 68 (64, 74) and 68 (65, 74) years in the LIFT and MAF groups, respectively. Higher recurrence rates were observed after LIFT (17 (12.5%)) than after MAF (13 (10.7%)), but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.662). Postoperative incontinence was observed in 18 patients (13.2%) and seven patients (5.8%) in the LIFT and MAF groups, respectively (P = 0.044). The predictors for fistula recurrence were smoking (OR, 75.52; 95% CI, 1.02 to 5611.35; P = 0.049), length of tract (OR, 17.3; 95% CI, 1.49 to 201.13; P = 0.023), and CD classification (OR, 7.08; 95% CI, 1.51 to 33.14; P = 0.013). A low Charlson comorbidity index score (≤ 5) (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.99; P = 0.046) and high postoperative mean squeeze anal pressure (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95 to 0.99; P = 0.001) were significant factors associated with reduced risk of incontinence. In particular, LIFT was associated with a significantly higher risk of incontinence than MAF (OR, 2.089; 95% CI, 1.006 to 4.33; P = 0.04).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The healing rates of MAF and LIFT procedures did not differ significantly; however, continence was significantly better after MAF.

Validation experiments were conducted using simulations and phantom scans performed on a 7T Achieva MRI system. The observed sequence and waveforms were compared to the intended ones, and the gradient waveforms produced by the scanner were verified using a field camera. Image reconstruction was performed using the raw k-space samples acquired from both the native vendor environment and the Pulseq interpreter.

      "doi": "",
      "abstract": "T2 hyperintensities in spinal cord MR images are crucial biomarkers for conditions such as degenerative cervical myelopathy. However, current clinical diagnoses primarily rely on manual evaluation. Deep learning methods have shown promise in lesion detection, but most supervised approaches are heavily dependent on large, annotated datasets. Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) offers a compelling alternative by eliminating the need for abnormal data annotations. However, existing UAD methods rely on curated normal datasets and their performance frequently deteriorates when applied to clinical datasets due to domain shifts. We propose an Uncertainty-based Unsupervised Anomaly Detection framework, termed U2AD, to address these limitations. Unlike traditional methods, U2AD is designed to be trained and tested within the same clinical dataset, following a \"mask-and-reconstruction\" paradigm built on a Vision Transformer-based architecture. We introduce an uncertainty-guided masking strategy to resolve task conflicts between normal reconstruction and anomaly detection to achieve an optimal balance. Specifically, we employ a Monte-Carlo sampling technique to estimate reconstruction uncertainty mappings during training. By iteratively optimizing reconstruction training under the guidance of both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, U2AD reduces overall reconstruction variance while emphasizing regions. Experimental results demonstrate that U2AD outperforms existing supervised and unsupervised methods in patient-level identification and segment-level localization tasks. This framework establishes a new benchmark for incorporating uncertainty guidance into UAD, highlighting its clinical utility in addressing domain shifts and task conflicts in medical image anomaly detection.

      "abstract": "Accurately detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD) and predicting mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score are important tasks in elderly health by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Most of the previous methods on these two tasks are based on single-task learning and rarely consider the correlation between them. Since the MMSE score, which is an important basis for AD diagnosis, can also reflect the progress of cognitive impairment, some studies have begun to apply multi-task learning methods to these two tasks. However, how to exploit feature correlation remains a challenging problem for these methods. To comprehensively address this challenge, we propose a MRI-based multi-task decoupled learning method for AD detection and MMSE score prediction. First, a multi-task learning network is proposed to implement AD detection and MMSE score prediction, which exploits feature correlation by adding three multi-task interaction layers between the backbones of the two tasks. Each multi-task interaction layer contains two feature decoupling modules and one feature interaction module. Furthermore, to enhance the generalization between tasks of the features selected by the feature decoupling module, we propose the feature consistency loss constrained feature decoupling module. Finally, in order to exploit the specific distribution information of MMSE score in different groups, a distribution loss is proposed to further enhance the model performance. We evaluate our proposed method on multi-site datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed multi-task decoupled representation learning method achieves good performance, outperforming single-task learning and other existing state-of-the-art methods.",

The elucidation of neural alterations may provide novel insights into its management. We aimed to develop a multiparameter brain MRI-based radiomics model (RM) for characterizing neural alterations in CD patients and to interpret these alterations using multiomics traits.<h4>Methods</h4>This prospective study enrolled 230 CD patients and 46 healthy controls (HCs). Participants voluntarily underwent brain MRI and psychological assessment (n = 155), blood metabolomics analysis (n = 260), and/or fecal 16S rRNA sequencing (n = 182). The RM was developed using 13 features selected from 13,870 first-order features extracted from multiparameter brain MRI in training cohort (CD, n = 75; HCs, n = 32) and validated in test cohort (CD, n = 34; HCs, n = 14). Multiomics data (including gut microbiomics, blood metabolomics, and brain radiomics) were compared between CD patients and HCs.<h4>Results</h4>In the training cohort, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of RM for distinguishing CD patients from HCs was 0.991 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.975-1.000). In test cohort, RM showed an AUC of 0.956 (95% CI, 0.881-1.000). CD-enriched blood metabolites such as triacylglycerol (TAG) exhibited significant correlations with both brain features detected by RM and CD-enriched microbiota (e.g., Veillonella). One notable correlation was found between Veillonella and Ctx-Lh-Middle-Temporal-CBF-p90 (r = 0.41). Mediation analysis further revealed that dysbiosis, such as of Veillonella, may regulate the blood flow in the middle temporal cortex through TAG.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We developed a multiparameter MRI-based RM that characterized the neural alterations of CD patients, and multiomics data offer potential evidence to support the validity of our model. Our study may offer clues to help provide potential therapeutic targets.<h4>Critical relevance statement</h4>Our brain-gut axis study developed a novel model using multiparameter MRI and radiomics to characterize brain changes in patients with Crohn's disease. We validated this model's effectiveness using multiomics data, making it a potential biomarker for better patient management.<h4>Key points</h4>Utilizing multiparametric MRI and radiomics techniques could unveil Crohn's disease's neurophenotype. The neurophenotype radiomics model is interpreted using multiomics data. This model may serve as a novel biomarker for Crohn's disease management.",

      "abstract": "Purpose: An approach for the automated segmentation of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) in multicenter water-fat MRI scans of the abdomen was investigated, using two different neural network architectures.   Methods: The two fully convolutional network architectures U-Net and V-Net were trained, evaluated and compared on the water-fat MRI data. Data of the study Tellus with 90 scans from a single center was used for a 10-fold cross-validation in which the most successful configuration for both networks was determined. These configurations were then tested on 20 scans of the multicenter study beta-cell function in JUvenile Diabetes and Obesity (BetaJudo), which involved a different study population and scanning device.   Results: The U-Net outperformed the used implementation of the V-Net in both cross-validation and testing. In cross-validation, the U-Net reached average dice scores of 0.988 (VAT) and 0.992 (SAT). The average of the absolute quantification errors amount to 0.67% (VAT) and 0.39% (SAT). On the multi-center test data, the U-Net performs only slightly worse, with average dice scores of 0.970 (VAT) and 0.987 (SAT) and quantification errors of 2.80% (VAT) and 1.65% (SAT).   Conclusion: The segmentations generated by the U-Net allow for reliable quantification and could therefore be viable for high-quality automated measurements of VAT and SAT in large-scale studies with minimal need for human intervention. The high performance on the multicenter test data furthermore shows the robustness of this approach for data of different patient demographics and imaging centers, as long as a consistent imaging protocol is used.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning is a powerful set of techniques that has enhanced the abilities of neuroscientists to interpret information collected through EEG, fMRI, and MEG data. With these powerful techniques comes the danger of overfitting of hyper-parameters which can render results invalid, and cause a failure to generalize beyond the data set. We refer to this problem as  over-hyping and show that it is pernicious despite commonly used precautions. In particular, over-hyping occurs when an analysis is run repeatedly with slightly different analysis parameters and one set of results is selected based on the analysis. When this is done, the resulting method is unlikely to generalize to a new dataset, rendering it a partially, or perhaps even completely spurious result that will not be valid outside of the data used in the original analysis. While it is commonly assumed that cross-validation is an effective protection against such spurious results generated through overfitting or overhyping, this is not actually true. In this article, we show that both one-shot and iterative optimization of an analysis are prone to over-hyping, despite the use of cross-validation. We demonstrate that non-generalizable results can be obtained even on non-informative (i.e. random) data by modifying hyper-parameters in seemingly innocuous ways. We recommend a number of techniques for limiting over-hyping, such as lock-boxes, blind analyses, pre-registrations, and nested cross-validation. These techniques, are common in other fields that use machine learning, including computer science and physics. Adopting similar safeguards is critical for ensuring the robustness of machine-learning techniques in the neurosciences.",

      "doi": "",
      "abstract": "Data from a multi-parametric MRI study of patients with possible early-stage prostate cancer was assessed with a view to creating an efficient clinical protocol. Based on a correlation analysis suggesting that diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) scores are more strongly correlated with overall PIRADS scores than other modalities such as dynamic contrast enhanced imaging or spectroscopy, we investigate the combination of T2-weighted imaging (T2w) and DWI as a potential diagnostic tool for prostate cancer detection, staging and guided biopsies. Quantification of the noise floor in the DWI images and careful fitting of the data suggests that the mono-exponential model provides a very good fit to the data and there is no evidence of non-Gaussian diffusion for $b$-values up to 1000 s/mm$^2$. This precludes the use of kurtosis or other non-Gaussian measures as a biomarker for prostate cancer in our case. However, the ADC scores for healthy and probably malignant regions are significantly lower for the latter in all 20 but one patient. The results suggest that a simplified mp-MRI protocol combining T2w and DWI may be a good compromise for a cost and time efficient, early-stage prostate cancer diagnostic programme, combining robust MR biomarkers for prostate cancer that can be reliably quantified and appear well-suited for general clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "Immunotherapy constitutes a paradigm shift in cancer treatment. Its FDA approval for several indications has yielded improved prognosis for cases where traditional therapy has shown limited efficiencey. However, many patients still fail to benefit from this treatment modality, and the exact mechanisms responsible for tumor response are unknown. Noninvasive treatment monitoring is crucial for longitudinal tumor characterization and the early detection of non-responders. While various medical imaging techniques can provide a morphological picture of the lesion and its surrounding tissue, a molecular-oriented imaging approach holds the key to unraveling biological effects that occur much earlier in the immunotherapy timeline. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a highly versatile imaging modality, where the image contrast can be tailored to emphasize a particular biophysical property of interest using advanced engineering of the imaging pipeline. In this review, recent advances in molecular-MRI based cancer immunotherapy monitoring are described. Next, the presentation of the underlying physics, computational, and biological features are complemented by a critical analysis of the results obtained in preclinical and clinical studies. Finally, emerging artificial intelligence (AI)-based strategies to further distill, quantify, and interpret the image-based molecular MRI information are discussed in terms of perspectives for the future.",

      "doi": "",
      "abstract": "Liver fibrosis represents the accumulation of excessive extracellular matrix caused by sustained hepatic injury. It disrupts normal lobular architecture and function, increasing the chances of cirrhosis and liver failure. Precise staging of fibrosis for early diagnosis and intervention is often invasive, which carries risks and complications. To address this challenge, recent advances in artificial intelligence-based liver segmentation and fibrosis staging offer a non-invasive alternative. As a result, the CARE 2025 Challenge aimed for automated methods to quantify and analyse liver fibrosis in real-world scenarios, using multi-centre, multi-modal, and multi-phase MRI data. This challenge included tasks of precise liver segmentation (LiSeg) and fibrosis staging (LiFS). In this study, we developed an automated pipeline for both tasks across all the provided MRI modalities. This pipeline integrates pseudo-labelling based on multi-modal co-registration, liver segmentation using deep neural networks, and liver fibrosis staging based on shape, textural, appearance, and directional (STAD) features derived from segmentation masks and MRI images. By solely using the released data with limited annotations, our proposed pipeline demonstrated excellent generalisability for all MRI modalities, achieving top-tier performance across all competition subtasks. This approach provides a rapid and reproducible framework for quantitative MRI-based liver fibrosis assessment, supporting early diagnosis and clinical decision-making.

This study aimed to determine the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and intestinal ultrasound (IUS) in the assessment of the radiologic response of Crohn's disease strictures to treatment.<h4>Methods</h4>The STRIDENT (Stricture Definition and Treatment) study was a randomized controlled trial of (2:1) intensive high-dose adalimumab combined with a thiopurine vs standard dose monotherapy adalimumab in patients with stricturing Crohn's disease. Clinical response was defined as a reduction in the Obstructive Symptom Score at 12 months. Intestinal ultrasound was performed at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 months and MRI at baseline and 12 months. This study examines secondary outcomes of stricture resolution and changes in stricture morphology with treatment.<h4>Results</h4>Of 77 patients, 52 were in the intensive treatment group and 25 in the standard therapy group. Clinical response was achieved in 56 of 77 patients (73%). Complete stricture resolution occurred in 17 patients on IUS (29%) and 16 patients on MRI (22%). Stricture improvement occurred in 23 of 59 patients on IUS (39%) and 24 of 72 patients on MRI (33%). Bowel wall thickness improved at 12 months on both IUS (P < .0001) and MRI (P < .001) and was significantly lower in clinical responders (IUS P = .003) and those with fecal calprotectin < 100 µg/g (IUS P < .001; MRI P = .001).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Radiologic severity of Crohn's disease strictures can improve with drug treatment, with complete stricture resolution observed in some. Intestinal ultrasound and MRI are effective modalities for monitoring the treatment response in patients with stricturing Crohn's disease (STRIDENT Drug Therapy Study: NCT03220841).",

      "abstract": "<h4>Rationale</h4>Anal fistulas typically result from infected anal glands, presenting with symptoms like recurrent purulent discharge, pain, and itching around the anus. Infections are commonly located in the skin, soft tissues, or spaces surrounding the rectum and anal canal. Notably, extensive subcutaneous tissue infections in the buttocks are exceedingly uncommon. Distinguishing this condition from anal fistulas associated with Crohn disease poses a significant diagnostic challenge.<h4>Patient concerns</h4>A 27-year-old female patient presented with pain, swelling, and purulent discharge in the buttocks persisting for 6 months, with a recent exacerbation over the last 2 days.<h4>Diagnoses</h4>The diagnoses were established through a comprehensive medical history assessment, physical examination, enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the anal canal, and electronic colonoscopy, revealing: complex anal fistula, infected sinus in the buttock area, constipation, and mild anemia.<h4>Interventions</h4>The surgical intervention involving complete fistula dissection, excision of the affected area's apex in the buttocks, removal of necrotic material, fibrous tissue debridement, and thread-draped drainage facilitated fistula tract healing and markedly enhanced patients' quality of life.<h4>Outcomes</h4>After treatment, the patient showed no purulent discharge, swelling, or pain in the buttocks, and there was no bleeding or fluid leakage. The patient was followed up for 18 months after the treatment, and the wound healed well, with a satisfactory treatment outcome.<h4>Lessons</h4>In the context of diagnosing and treating anal fistulas, it is crucial to abandon the notion that infection is limited to the perianal region. Utilizing advanced magnetic resonance imaging of the anal canal is essential for precise localization, while employing a combination of diagnostic examinations is warranted for accurate differential diagnosis. Postsurgical follow-up of anal fistula patients for a minimum of 1 year is advisable to monitor recurrence and address predisposing factors like constipation. In instances of uncommon variants, it is advisable to engage in multidisciplinary cooperation to synthesize insights from various specialties, thereby enhancing the scientific rigor of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.",

However, the manual selection of four specific slices for rating throughout the entire brain is a time-consuming process. Our goal was to develop a deep learning-based model capable of automatically identifying the four slices relevant to CHIPS. To achieve this, we trained a 4-class slice classification model (BSCA) using the ADNI T2-FLAIR dataset (N=150) with the assistance of ResNet. Subsequently, we tested the model's performance on a local dataset (N=30). The results demonstrated the efficacy of our model, with an accuracy of 99.82% and an F1-score of 99.83%. This achievement highlights the potential impact of BSCA as an automatic screening tool, streamlining the selection of four specific T2-FLAIR slices that encompass white matter landmarks along the cholinergic pathways.

      "abstract": "The European Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology (ESGAR) presents an ESR Essentials review article on Crohn's disease (CD) diagnosis and treatment response assessment. The focus is on luminal disease, particularly in the small bowel, and to a lesser degree, the colon. Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE) and ultrasound are typically the first-line radiological investigations for known or suspected luminal CD. They are accurate for assessing the entirety of the bowel wall and extra-enteric tissues and are generally well tolerated by patients. CT has utility as well, especially in the acute setting. Disease location, extent, and phenotype should be assessed. Well-validated imaging signs of acute inflammation (active disease) are responsive to therapeutic interventions and include bowel mural thickening and oedema, perimural inflammation, ulceration, and hypervascularity. Other phenotypes (stricturing or penetrating with fistulae and/or abscesses) can coexist, and the predominant disease phenotype should be established. We recommend that radiologists work closely within multidisciplinary teams to optimise imaging selection for individual patients, tailored to the clinical question. Findings should be clearly communicated to best inform management decisions using standardised terminology, and structured reporting of disease status, treatment response categorisation, and any associated complications. KEY POINTS: MR Enterography and intestinal ultrasound are the key imaging modalities for the diagnosis and follow-up of luminal CD, with CT reserved primarily for the acute setting. Inflammation, or active disease, is the hallmark of luminal CD, and there are several validated mural and extramural imaging signs of activity, often coexisting with chronic changes. Changes in the imaging markers of active luminal CD are central to radiologists' judgement of treatment response and should be communicated in a standardised report in addition to any stricturing or penetrating complications.",

      "abstract": "Numerous brain lesion and fMRI studies have linked individual differences in executive abilities and fluid intelligence to brain regions of the fronto-parietal \"multiple-demand\" (MD) network. Yet, fMRI studies have yielded conflicting evidence as to whether better executive abilities are associated with stronger or weaker MD activations and whether this relationship is restricted to the MD network. Here, in a large-sample (n=216) fMRI investigation, we found that stronger activity in MD regions - functionally defined in individual participants - was robustly associated with more accurate and faster responses on a spatial working memory task performed in the scanner, as well as fluid intelligence measured independently (n=114). In line with some prior claims about a relationship between language and fluid intelligence, we also found a weak association between activity in the brain regions of the left fronto-temporal language network during an independent passive reading task, and performance on the working memory task. However, controlling for the level of MD activity abolished this relationship, whereas the MD activity-behavior association remained highly reliable after controlling for the level of activity in the language network. Finally, we demonstrate how unreliable MD activity measures, coupled with small sample sizes, could falsely lead to the opposite, negative, association that has been reported in some prior studies. Taken together, these results demonstrate that a core component of individual differences variance in executive abilities and fluid intelligence is selectively and robustly positively associated with the level of activity in the MD network, a result that aligns well with lesion studies.",

These two practices are also heavily carried out in Anatolia and Thrace where 5 subspecies reside naturally.Here, we carried out an analysis of population structure of honey bees sampled from six different regions (n = 250) in order to test the genetic impacts of migratory beekeeping, queen and colony trade and conservation efficacy of isolated regions. A total of 30 microsatellite markers were used in four multiplex reactions.Direct genetic impact of migratory beekeeping was demonstrated first time based on a comparison of assignment of individuals to their geographically native populations where migratory colonies showed less fidelity. We found genetic evidence for them acting as a hybrid zone mobile in space and time, becoming vectors of otherwise local gene combinations.The effects of honey bee trade were revealed by the presence of very high introgression levels from the highly commercial Caucasian bees naturally limited to a narrow range. We also measured the direction and magnitude of this gene flow connected with bee trade.Comparison between regions that are either open to migratory beekeeping or not let us evaluate the status of isolated regions as centers of limited gene flow and showed the importance of establishing such regions.Despite signs of gene flow, our findings confirm high levels of geographically structured genetic diversity of four subspecies of honey bees in Turkey and emphasize the need to develop policies to maintain this diversity.Our overall results might potentially bear a wider interest to the community since they constitute an important attempt to quantify the effects of anthropogenic impacts on established patterns of honey bee diversity. Our measurable and justified findings on migratory beekeeping, queen and colony replacements as well as conservation implications will hopefully be of use for the decision makers and other stakeholders.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

      "abstract": "Perianal fistulising Crohn's disease is a challenging complication that can affect up to 20% of patients with Crohn's disease and is associated with significant morbidity. Despite advances in medical therapies, particularly anti-tumor necrosis factor agents, the majority of patients still require surgical intervention. Accurate diagnosis and monitoring are essential to optimise outcomes and guide multidisciplinary management. Although clinical scoring systems such as the perianal disease activity index are widely used, their subjective application limits their reproducibility and reliability, underscoring the need for more objective methods of evaluating perianal fistulising Crohn's disease activity. Imaging has thus become central to the objective assessment of perianal fistulising Crohn's disease, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) recognised as the gold standard in view of its ability to provide clear, detailed images of the perianal region in a radiation-free manner. Guidelines also endorse the use of imaging modalities such as endoanal ultrasound and transperineal ultrasound as viable alternatives to MRI for the assessment of perianal fistulising Crohn's disease in centres with appropriate expertise. This article aims to evaluate and compare the diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of MRI, endoanal ultrasound, and transperineal ultrasound in the assessment of perianal fistulising Crohn's disease, highlighting their respective strengths, limitations, and roles in clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "Perianal Crohn's disease (pCD) is a complex manifestation of Crohn's disease. Classifying this patient cohort for both clinical purposes and for inclusion into research trials is challenging but crucial in order to improve outcomes. This review provides an overview of historical classifications of both fistulising and non-fistulising pCD, including the Park's, Cardiff-Hughes and American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) classifications, as well as recent advances including the Treatment Optimisation and CLASSification of perianal Crohn's disease (TOpClass) classification of fistulising pCD. Secondly, this article provides a scoping review of recent trials in pCD and describes how the cohorts in these trials relate to the TOpClass classification. Of the 19 studies relating to pCD that were identified, four could be confidently classified as class 2a. Seven could be classified as class 2a or 2b, but it was not possible to subdivide further, and seven to class 2a, 2b or 2c, but it was not possible to subdivide further. One study population was classified as class 2a or 2c. In eight studies, it was not specified whether patients with a defunctioning stoma were included or excluded. This review demonstrates the heterogeneous nature of some patient cohorts in previous clinical trials, and how the TOpClass classification may be used to group patients more accurately for clinical use and inclusion in research trials.",

      "abstract": "Adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) experience a significant decline in quality of life due to various symptoms. Exercise has emerged as a potential therapeutic approach to improve IBD management, but its effectiveness requires further investigation. This systematic review, adhering to PRISMA 2020 guidelines, explored the effects of exercise on IBD progression and its potential as a treatment in adults. A comprehensive search strategy was conducted across three databases and two registries from May 12, 2024, to May 22, 2024. Methodological rigor and potential bias were minimized through quality assessment using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool 2 (RoB 2) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cohort studies, and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist for studies evaluating the effectiveness of non-randomized interventions. This process yielded 12 high-quality studies for analysis. The review identified positive evidence from both RCTs and observational studies. Exercise interventions demonstrated improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness, disease activity, quality of life, and mental health in adults with IBD. Studies explored various modalities, including aerobic exercise, resistance training, and mind-body interventions. However, further research is needed to optimize exercise prescription and elucidate the underlying mechanisms of action. This review strengthens the evidence for exercise as a beneficial intervention for IBD patients. Personalized exercise programs based on individual needs hold promise for improved IBD management and patient outcomes. However, limitations exist due to study design variations and the need for long-term follow-up studies.",

      "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Crohn's disease (CD) is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that is prevalent worldwide. It can affect any segment of the gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to the anus. When CD affects the anus, perianal fistulizing disease develops. The management of perianal CD is challenging and may require morbid surgery when there is no response to medical therapy. The emergence of novel biologic therapies, namely tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors, has proven to provide long-term relief and prevent disease-related complications. Perianal CD is, however, refractory or recurrent in up to 80% of patients. One of the reported options to manage perianal CD is hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), which aims at increasing tissue oxygen saturation in an attempt to promote repair and reverse local inflammation. Data on this approach is scant. <b>Methods</b>: A retrospective review was performed to identify patients with CD at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester who underwent HBOT for perianal disease between 2014 and 2023. Demographic and clinical data were reviewed, including the history of the disease, concomitant medical and surgical therapy and the need for fecal diversion. The HBOT regimen, including the number of sessions and clinical response, were reviewed. <b>Results</b>: Six patients aged from 19 to 60 years underwent HBOT for perianal CD. Two patients had a history of total proctocolectomy with ileal-anal pouch anastomosis (IPAA). All patients except one were on immunosuppressive medication including biologic agents. Four patients had fecal diversion with an ileostomy or colostomy. Patients received between 10 and 40 sessions of HBOT. Four patients reported symptomatic improvement. On physical examination and/or imaging assessment, improvement was noted in one patient. Progression of the perianal disease was noted in all other patients, with all except one requiring an operation in the following year. <b>Conclusions</b>: HBOT may provide symptomatic relief in some patients with refractory perianal CD, but data on its long-term efficacy remains limited.",

The objective of the study was to determine the value of volumetric changes in CD perianal fistulas after medical treatment to predict outcomes.<h4>Methods</h4>This is a retrospective single-center pilot study evaluating CD patients with active perianal fistulas who started biological therapy between 2012 and 2021. Eligible patients were those who had both pre- and post-treatment pelvic MRI and clinical follow-up of 2-5 years. Patients were categorized as clinically active or in remission based on fistula drainage. Using specific software, we calculated the 3D volume of the fistulas, and their active and fibrotic components. We evaluated MRI volumetric changes between assessments and analyzed their predictive value for clinical remission.<h4>Results</h4>We included 24 patients (83.3% with complex fistulas), of which 13 were in clinical remission at the last follow-up. Logistic regression analysis identified the percentage of relative change in the volumetric active component as an independent predictor of clinical remission (OR 0.92 [0.86-0.98] p = 0.013). The area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 85.3% (p < 0.0001). A reduction of ≥ 16% in the volumetric percentage of the active component has a sensitivity of 84.6 and specificity of 81% in predicting clinical remission during follow-up.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Changes in the 3D MRI volumetry of perianal fistulas might have value in predicting clinical remission. Specifically, the reduction in the volumetry of the active component emerges as a promising biomarker for assessing therapeutic response.",

Pre- and postoperative continence data were gathered prospectively, while long-term outcomes, including success rates and faecal continence, were evaluated using the Faecal Incontinence Severity Index (FISI) through questionnaires distributed in 2023.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 129 patients who underwent LIFT, 90 (70%) experienced failure of the procedure. A total of 24 patients, including those referred from other centres after failed LIFT, underwent TAFR, with a success rate of 71% (17 out of 24). No significant differences in faecal continence were observed between preoperative and postoperative FISI scores. Body mass index (BMI) was significantly associated with healing outcomes (p < 0.05), indicating that patients with a lower BMI had higher healing rates.<h4>Conclusion</h4>TAFR following failed LIFT surgery shows healing results equivalent to those of initial fistula repairs, with obesity emerging as a potential predictor of healing success.

However, there remains a paucity in the literature on the objective evaluation of sphincter integrity and fecal continence after the LIFT procedure.<h4>Objectives</h4>The present study undertakes a scoping review to systematically explore and map the published literature, to evaluate the sufficiency of data on the impact on continence in patients after the LIFT procedure.<h4>Design</h4>A systematic search of MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASe, CINAHL was performed from January 2007 to April 2020 and 597 publications were identified. Forty-two satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria. We performed a scoping review in accordance to the PRISMA-ScR guidelines.<h4>Results</h4>Only 3 (7.1%) of publications were randomized controlled trials, of which just 1 (2.4%) measured incontinence as a primary outcome. Continence was measured both pre- and post-LIFT in 30 (71.4%), of which 19 (45.2%) had a fixed protocol for continence assessment, which was heterogeneous between the studies. Continence was assessed using subjective scoring systems in 27 (64.3%) and objective measurement was performed in just 6 (14.3%). No studies performed post-operative anatomical assessment of the anal sphincter complex.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Long-term continence in post-LIFT patients is not supported with adequately powered prospective longitudinal trials using rigorously protocoled pre- and post-operative assessment of continence. Future research that focuses on a combination of objective assessment using anal manometry as well as anatomical assessment of the sphincter complex on top of subjective evaluation is needed before we can be certain if LIFT is indeed a sphincter and continence preserving technique.",

Of these, 57 patients underwent the IAICD (treatment group), while 63 patients received incision-drainage (control group). Clinical data from both groups were collected for statistical analysis. The primary outcomes measured were clinical efficacy, anal function scores and appearance scores. Secondary outcomes included postoperative pain, operation time, wound healing time and length of hospital stay.<h4>Results</h4>The treatment group had 52 cured cases, with a cure rate of 52/57 (91.2%), whereas the control group had 48 cured cases, with a cure rate of 48/63 (76.2%). The treatment group's clinical efficacy was significantly better than the control group (P = 0.03). The operation time was longer in the treatment group compared to the control group (P < 0.01). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of anal function scores, appearance scores, postoperative pain, wound healing time and length of hospital stay (P > 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that IAICD was a protective factor for the clinical efficacy of DPA patients (P = 0.01), While wound healing time and a history of perianal surgery were identified as independent risk factors associated with poor prognosis in patients with DPA (P = 0.039, P = 0.032).<h4>Conclusion</h4>For patients with DPA who have high expectations for minimizing postoperative recurrence, a comprehensive preoperative evaluation-including a history of prior perianal surgery-precise intraoperative localization of the internal opening, and meticulous postoperative wound care can collectively optimize clinical outcomes. The IAICD procedure not only preserves anal sphincter function but also effectively reduces the recurrence rate of postoperative abscesses or fistula formation.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background and aims</h4>Previous literature suggests that faecal calprotectin (FC) discriminates Crohn's disease perianal fistulas from cryptoglandular fistulas, irrespective of luminal disease. This study aims to prospectively validate this and analyse if increased local fistula calprotectin levels are associated with fistula characteristics.<h4>Methods</h4>In this prospective study, all consecutive patients with an active perianal fistula undergoing examination under anaesthesia were included. Faecal and fistula tract scraping calprotectin levels were determined. The primary objective was to analyse whether FC levels could be used to differentiate between Crohn's disease and cryptoglandular perianal fistulas. Secondary outcome parameters were the levels of local calprotectin in fistula scrapings and their correlation with fistula characteristics.<h4>Results</h4>Sixty-three patients were included in this study (perianal Crohn's disease; 45, cryptoglandular; 18). Faecal calprotectin levels were significantly higher in Crohn's disease patients compared with cryptoglandular fistula (354.3 [58.8-1076.3] vs. 47.3 [14.6-233.6] μg/g, p = 0.003). Faecal calprotectin could accurately discriminate Crohn's disease patients with active luminal disease from patients without luminal disease (median [interquartile range]) (1167.0 [557.0-2806.3] vs. 93.0 [47.5-571.6] μg/g, p = 0.001). Faecal calprotectin was not related to calprotectin levels in fistula scrapings. No fistula characteristic was found to be correlated to scraping calprotectin, but a correlation was found with the TOpCLASS classification system, which stratifies fistulas according to disease severity and outcome: class 2a (amenable for repair), class 2b (symptom control) and class 2c (gradually debilitating disease): 140[31.0-149.0]) μg/g versus 706[198.5-1936] μg/g versus 4000[1337-5894] μg/g, p < 0.001). Scraping calprotectin was also related to pronounced hyperintensity of the fistula tract on MRI in Crohn's disease patients: (69.0[30.0-821.0] vs. 1284.0[204.3-4185.5]; p = 0.01)) and cryptoglandular patients: (30.0[13.5-80.5] vs. 3012.0 [923.8-5021.0]; p = 0.002).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Crohn's disease and cryptoglandular perianal fistulas differ in FC levels. Local fistula calprotectin production did not explain this difference, implying FC reflects the luminal condition. A correlation exists between scraping calprotectin levels and Crohn's disease fistula severity, which could be clinically relevant for prognostic cohorts and tailored treatment.",

Therefore, imaging biomarkers that can distinguish a predominantly inflammatory from a chronic (i.e., non-inflammatory) stricture are highly relevant. The aim of our study was to determine whether it is possible to distinguish inflammatory (i.e., inflammatory and mixed) from chronic (i.e., non-inflammatory) strictures using quantified motility measured on cine-MRI in Crohn's disease (CD) patients.<h4>Methods</h4>In this prospective cross-sectional study, consecutive CD patients scheduled for small bowel resection underwent 2D cine-MRI prior to surgery. The motility of small bowel strictures and pre-stricture dilatations was quantified using a validated post-processing method (GIQuant). The resection specimens were scored by two pathologists as either: predominantly inflammatory, mixed, or predominantly chronic (i.e., non-inflammatory). For the analysis, strictures were stratified into inflammatory strictures (i.e., predominantly inflammatory and mixed) and chronic (i.e., non-inflammatory) strictures.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty-eight patients were included with 30 strictures and 15 pre-stricture dilatations. Pre-stricture dilatation motility was higher for chronic (i.e., non-inflammatory) compared to inflammatory (i.e., inflammatory and mixed) strictures (289.5 AU [188.0-362.9] vs. 113.1 AU [83.6-142.4], P = .004). The area under the curve (AUC) for chronic (i.e., non-inflammatory) stricture detection was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.78-1.0, P = .01). Within strictures, no difference was found between motility in different histopathology categories (P = .6).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Motility in the pre-stricture dilatations of chronic (i.e., non-inflammatory) strictures was higher compared to inflammatory (i.e., inflammatory and mixed) strictures. No difference in motility was observed in stricture motility among stricture subtypes. Our findings suggest that quantified motility-measured with cine-MRI-of pre-stricture dilatations could possibly distinguish chronic (i.e., non-inflammatory) strictures from inflammatory (i.e., inflammatory and mixed) strictures.<h4>Advances in knowledge</h4>Motility measured with cine-MRI could provide an imaging biomarker for the distinction between chronic (i.e., non-inflammatory) and inflammatory (i.e., inflammatory and mixed) strictures in CD.",

The baseline and one subsequent follow-up scan for each patient were paired to form longitudinal comparisons. Skeletal muscle, visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) indexes were calculated from tissue areas measured at the third lumbar vertebra level per scan, standardized by dividing the height<sup>2</sup> and lumbar height<sup>2</sup> (height<sub>L1-L5</sub>). We also assessed the correlation between changes in VAT to total adipose tissue ratio (VA/TA index) and CD activity scores (5-point MRE classification) using Spearman's correlation analysis. A multivariate linear regression model was used to adjust for the follow-up duration and treatment type.<h4>Results</h4>Overall, 49 patients (with 49 paired scans) were enrolled. VA/TA index changes were negatively correlated with changes in skeletal muscle index (SMI; r =  - 0.339, p < 0.05). The VA/TA index (52.69 ± 10.66% vs. 49.18 ± 10.80%, p < 0.001) and the total MRE score (8.0 ± 3.9 vs. 5.7 ± 3.4, p < 0.001) decreased significantly during follow-up, regardless of follow-up duration and treatment type (both p > 0.05). Changes in total MRE score were negatively correlated with SMI changes (r =  - 0.408, p < 0.01) but positively correlated with VA/TA index changes (r = 0.479, p < 0.01).<h4>Conclusion</h4>An increase in SMI and a decrease in VA/TA index could reflect improved nutritional and inflammatory status.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Aim</h4>To assess the association of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the psoas muscles and psoas muscle index (PMI) with the activity and behaviour of Crohn's disease (CD).<h4>Material and methods</h4>This was a retrospective study of 88 CD patients who underwent magnetic resonance enterography. Patients were classified according to the Montreal Classification in uncomplicated (non-stricturing, non-penetrating, B1), and complicated (structuring [B2] and penetrating disease [B3]). At the level of the third lumbar vertebra, the ADC and PMI were estimated. CD activity was analysed using the Magnetic Resonance Index of Activity (MaRIA), and depending on its values patients were categorized as high or low activity. Additionally, the presence of creeping fat (CrF) was used to evaluate activity. ADC and PMI were using Student's <i>t</i>-test.<h4>Results</h4>Our study included 47 males and 41 females (mean age of 38.69 ±14.4 years). The ADC in uncomplicated (B1, <i>n</i> = 45) and complicated disease (B2 + B3, <i>n</i> = 43) were 1.11 ±0.19 and 1.03 ±0.10 (10<sup>-3</sup>*mm<sup>2</sup>/s), respectively, (<i>p</i> = 0.02). ADC was significantly lower in patients with stricturing disease than in patients without strictures (1.02 ±0.11 and 1.10 ±0.18 [10<sup>-3</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s], respectively, <i>p</i> = 0.01). The group with non-penetrating disease showed higher PMI than those with penetrating disease (5.71 ±1.88 vs. 4.42 ±1.55 cm<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively, <i>p</i> = 0.10). There was no significant difference in PMI and ADC between patients with low and high MaRIA or positive and negative CrF.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The ADC of the psoas muscles is significantly lower in CD patients with uncomplicated disease, particularly those with stricturing disease. Therefore, ADC can be considered as an imaging biomarker of myopathic changes in CD patients.",

      "abstract": "We study the problem of estimating the continuous response over time to interventions using observational time series---a retrospective dataset where the policy by which the data are generated is unknown to the learner. We are motivated by applications where response varies by individuals and therefore, estimating responses at the individual-level is valuable for personalizing decision-making. We refer to this as the problem of estimating individualized treatment response (ITR) curves. In statistics, G-computation formula (Robins, 1986) has been commonly used for estimating treatment responses from observational data containing sequential treatment assignments. However, past studies have focused predominantly on obtaining point-in-time estimates at the population level. We leverage the G-computation formula and develop a novel Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) method that can flexibly model functional data and provide posterior inference over the treatment response curves at both the individual and population level. On a challenging dataset containing time series from patients admitted to a hospital, we estimate responses to treatments used in managing kidney function and show that the resulting fits are more accurate than alternative approaches. Accurate methods for obtaining ITRs from observational data can dramatically accelerate the pace at which personalized treatment plans become possible.",

The pooled relapse rate after AZA withdrawal was 32.5% (95% CI: 28.2-37.2%; I<sup>2</sup> = 94.2%). UC patients exhibited higher relapse rates (41.3%) than CD patients (24.7%, <i>p</i> = 0.003). Shorter AZA duration, elevated CRP, and absence of mucosal healing were associated with increased relapse risk. Meta-regression identified AZA duration as a significant predictor (β = -0.18, <i>p</i> = 0.009). Post-relapse management often involved AZA reintroduction or escalation to biologics, with low surgery rates. The GRADE assessment revealed that the certainty of evidence for the majority of primary outcomes was classified as low to very low. <b>Conclusions</b>: While this meta-analysis suggests that relapse after AZA withdrawal occurs frequently in IBD patients, the low to very low certainty of evidence limits definitive recommendations. The significant heterogeneity indicates that relapse risk varies across different patient populations and different settings.",

In this study, we proposed an open natural language processing development framework. We evaluated it through the implementation of NLP algorithms for the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). Based on the interests in information extraction from COVID-19 related clinical notes, our work includes 1) an open data annotation process using COVID-19 signs and symptoms as the use case, 2) a community-driven ruleset composing platform, and 3) a synthetic text data generation workflow to generate texts for information extraction tasks without involving human subjects. The corpora were derived from texts from three different institutions (Mayo Clinic, University of Kentucky, University of Minnesota). The gold standard annotations were tested with a single institution's (Mayo) ruleset. This resulted in performances of 0.876, 0.706, and 0.694 in F-scores for Mayo, Minnesota, and Kentucky test datasets, respectively. The study as a consortium effort of the N3C NLP subgroup demonstrates the feasibility of creating a federated NLP algorithm development and benchmarking platform to enhance multi-institution clinical NLP study and adoption. Although we use COVID-19 as a use case in this effort, our framework is general enough to be applied to other domains of interest in clinical NLP.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Introduction</h4>Delayed wound healing (DWH) following anal fistula surgery is a common complication that prolongs recovery, increases patient morbidity, and imposes significant healthcare costs. Potential risk factors such as diabetes, smoking, fistula complexity, and surgical techniques have been suggested in individual studies, yet no comprehensive synthesis exists to guide clinical practice. This study aims to identify and evaluate risk factors associated with DWH after anal fistula surgery by combining existing evidence and grading the evidence.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>This study will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines. We will search PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and grey literature databases from inception to March 2025, with no language restrictions. Observational studies (cohort and case-control) reporting risk factors for DWH, defined as incomplete healing beyond 6-12 weeks post-surgery, will be included. Two independent reviewers will screen titles/abstracts, perform full-text reviews, extract data regarding study design, sample size, risk factors and outcomes, and assess risk of bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Primary outcomes will include odds ratios (OR) or relative risks (RR) for factors such as comorbidities, lifestyle factors, and operative approaches. A random-effects meta-analysis will pool effect estimates if heterogeneity (I² < 50%) permits; otherwise, a narrative synthesis will be conducted. Subgroup analyses will explore differences by study design and patient characteristics, with publication bias assessed using funnel plots and Egger's test. The certainty of evidence will be evaluated with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.<h4>Discussion</h4>This study's strengths include its comprehensive search strategy and rigorous methodology, providing a robust synthesis of risk factors. Clinically, identifying modifiable risk factors could enhance preoperative optimization and postoperative care, reducing delayed healing rates. Future studies should standardize definitions of delayed healing and explore under-investigated factors like wound care techniques or microbiome influences to refine risk prediction models.<h4>Registration</h4>PROSPERO CRD420251013602.",

The objective of this study is to evaluate the influence of ESGO QIs and clinicopathological factors on progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with early-stage cervical cancer in a retrospective cohort. <b>Methods</b>: A retrospective study was conducted in patients with early-stage cervical cancer who underwent radical surgery with pelvic lymph node assessment at La Paz University Hospital between 2005 and 2022. The cohort was divided into two groups according to the timing of surgery (before vs. after 2010), when MRI was implemented as a standardized diagnostic tool and the multidisciplinary tumor board was established. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed, including demographic and histopathological variables, as well as adherence to ESGO QIs, focusing on those related to the overall management. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated and compared between groups. <b>Results</b>: The implementation of systematic MRI and a multidisciplinary tumor board at our center was associated with a significant reduction in positive surgical margins (<i>p</i> = 0.003) and parametrial invasion (<i>p</i> < 0.001), as well as improved diagnostic accuracy, lowering the rate of upstaging from 31.6% before 2010 to 4.4% thereafter (<i>p</i> < 0.001). PFS in the post-2010 cohort was significantly improved (log-rank <i>p</i> = 0.0408), although no differences in overall survival (OS) were observed (log-rank <i>p</i> = 0.2602). Additionally, cervical conization prior to radical hysterectomy was associated with a markedly reduced risk of recurrence (HR 0.12, <i>p</i> < 0.001), representing the most significant prognostic factor for PFS in our cohort. <b>Conclusions</b>: The correct application of ESGO QIs, along with appropriate staging and pathological assessment, is essential to improve prognosis in cervical cancer.

All patients underwent preoperative 3-dimensional endoanal ultrasound, with adjunctive magnetic resonance imaging performed if ultrasound indicated a complex fistula. Imaging examinations were retrospectively evaluated to categorize fistulas according to the Garg classification and the newly proposed classification system. The new classification included 6 severity grades based on the characteristics of the primary tract: submucosal, intersphincteric, low transsphincteric, high transsphincteric, multiple, and suprasphincteric/extrasphincteric. Each grade was further subdivided into 3 subtypes (A, B, C) based on the extension of secondary tracts.<h4>Results</h4>When compared with the new classification, the Garg classification demonstrated a slightly lower ability to predict the feasibility of fistulotomy in simple fistulas (94.2% vs 99.1%; Fisher exact test, P=0.006). A strong positive correlation was found between the surgery failure rate and the severity grade of the new classification (Spearman rho, 0.90; P<0.001), whereas the Garg classification showed a nonsignificant positive correlation with surgical failure rate (Spearman rho, 0.90; P=0.08).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The new imaging-guided, anatomy-based classification of anorectal fistulas demonstrates high accuracy in defining disease severity.

Individual participant data were requested from the original study cohorts. Inclusion criteria were age ≥16 years, pCD as a (co)indication for start of anti-TNF therapy, more than three doses, and remission of luminal and pCD at anti-TNF discontinuation.

This review explores biochemical properties and physiological roles of albumin, its place in nutritional assessment, current understanding of perturbed circulating concentrations, and role in clinical management, with special focus on patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).<h4>Methods</h4>A detailed literature search was performed.<h4>Results</h4>Albumin is synthesized by hepatocytes and comprises 3% of total body protein. It has a prolonged intravascular half-life (17-19 h) due to neonatal Fc-receptor-mediated salvage and has a multitude of physiological functions. Albumin homeostasis is affected in disease states often resulting in reduced level, which is not a direct marker of malnutrition. In patients with IBD, morbid albumin concentrations provide prognostic information, identification of nonintestinal conditions, guidance to the required aggressiveness of therapy and biologic dosage, monitoring of disease activity, and potential need for therapeutic escalation. Barriers to utilization of morbid albumin levels include the lack of consensus regarding cutoff values and the deficiency of high-quality data in this domain due to the retrospective design of the majority of studies. Serum levels hold greatest clinical potential in prognostication in acute severe ulcerative colitis. The premorbid level in the individual may provide insight into dosing of biologics and potentially enhance interpretation of morbid levels.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Understanding the physiology and pathophysiology of albumin is fundamental to interpreting its circulating levels. The clinical value of its measurement in patients with IBD may be undervalued, as it assists in evaluation of disease severity, prognosis, and therapeutic decision-making.",

Instituting advanced therapies at an early stage to suppress inflammation aims to prevent future complications such as stricturing or penetrating disease, and subsequent surgical resection. Therapeutics are effective but associated with certain side-effects and relatively expensive. There is therefore an urgent need for robust methods to predict which newly diagnosed patients will develop disabling disease, to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from early, advanced therapies. We aim to determine if magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) features at diagnosis improve prediction of disabling CD within 5 years of diagnosis.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>We describe the protocol for a multicentre, non-randomised, single-arm, prospective study of adult patients with newly diagnosed CD. We will use patients already recruited to the METRIC study and extend their clinical follow-up, as well as a separate group of newly diagnosed patients who were not part of the METRIC trial (MRE within 3 months of diagnosis), to ensure an adequate sample size. Follow-up will extend for at least 4 years. The primary outcome is to evaluate the comparative predictive ability of prognostic models incorporating MRE severity scores (Magnetic resonance Enterography Global Score (MEGS), simplified MAgnetic Resonance Index of Activity (sMaRIA) and Lémann Index) versus models using standard characteristics alone to predict disabling CD (modified Beaugerie definition) within 5 years of new diagnosis.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>This study protocol achieved National Health Service Research Ethics Committee (NHS REC), London-Hampstead Research Ethics Committee approval (IRAS 217422).

We introduced low-dose computed tomography enterography (CTE) as a monitoring method for Crohn's disease and retrospectively investigated the accuracy of evaluating TH by CTE. Methods Among Crohn's disease patients who underwent low-dose CTE at our hospital from January 2009 to March 2021, 122 patients who underwent colonoscopy or balloon endoscopy within 2 weeks were included. Results of radiological and endoscopic examinations were reviewed independently by radiologists and gastrointestinal endoscopists, respectively. The concordance rate of the diagnosis between CTE and endoscopy was evaluated. Results Twenty-six patients (21.3%) achieved TH, and the kappa index was 0.743. On comparing the TH and non-TH groups, the Crohn's disease activity index (p=0.02), endoscopic healing rate (p<0.001), serum albumin (p=0.043), and serum C-reactive protein level (p=0.018) showed significant differences. Among the 122 patients, 69 (56.5%) showed concordance between the diagnosis of CTE and endoscopy, and 22 (18.0%) achieved both TH and endoscopic healing.

Compelling evidence indicates that neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) plays a role in the pathophysiology of Crohn's disease (CD) and may serve as a noninvasive biomarker for its diagnosis. This study aimed to evaluate NGAL's potential as a noninvasive diagnostic biomarker between pfCD and cryptoglandular (CG) perianal fistula, and its correlation with disease severity in pfCD.<h4>Methods</h4>Serum, fecal, and fistula tissue samples were collected from 96 patients with pfCD and 97 patients with CG perianal fistula as controls. Serum NGAL levels were quantified through ELISA and fistula tissue NGAL levels were quantified through immunohistochemical staining, while pfCD disease severity was evaluated using the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and Perianal Disease Activity Index (PDAI). Additional laboratory parameters, including NGAL, fecal calprotectin (FC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), were analyzed, and their correlations were assessed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted to evaluate NGAL's diagnostic potential for pfCD.<h4>Results</h4>Levels of serum NGAL, FC, CRP, and ESR in patients with pfCD were significantly elevated compared to the control group (<i>p</i> < 0.001); Spearman correlation analysis indicated a positive correlation between serum NGAL and FC, CRP, ESR, CDAI, and PDAI scores. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for serum NGAL in diagnosing pfCD was 0.927 (95% <i>CI</i>: 0.890-0.964). The AUC for FC in diagnosing pfCD were 0.887 (95% <i>CI</i>: 0.839-0.935). Additionally, serum and fistula tissue NGAL levels were positively correlated with disease complexity in pfCD according to the Montreal classification.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These findings suggest that serum NGAL is associated with pfCD severity and may offer a promising noninvasive biomarker for diagnosing and assessing pfCD.",

      "abstract": "Purpose Adult pilocytic astrocytoma (APA) is rare and clinically distinct from pediatric counterparts. Despite generally favorable prognosis, recurrence rates vary significantly based on tumor characteristics and surgical approaches. Literature regarding the influence of tumor volume, location, and patient age on surgical outcomes and survival is limited and inconclusive. This study addresses these gaps, evaluating the combined impact of these variables on APA prognosis and management. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 32 adult patients with surgically treated APA at our institution (2014-2023), examining demographics, imaging, histology, and outcomes. Results Mean age was 35.8 years (SD 11.6); 59% were male. Median Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) at admission was 90% (range 50-100%). Infratentorial tumors (56%) correlated significantly with lower KPS, increased cranial nerve deficits, cerebellar symptoms, hydrocephalus risk, prolonged operative time, higher CSF leaks (11%), and frequent revision surgeries. Gross total resection was achieved less frequently in infratentorial (33%) compared to supratentorial tumors (43%). Overall recurrence rate was 50%, strongly predicted by higher Ki-67 proliferation indices (p < 0.05), whereas resection extent alone lacked significant correlation. BRAF mutations occurred in only 38% of recurrent cases, highlighting APA's distinct molecular profile. Five-year mortality was 6%, exclusively in High-Grade Astrocytoma with Piloid Features (HGAP). Conclusion Our findings challenge assumptions of benign clinical courses for APAs. Infratentorial tumors present increased surgical challenges and require tailored management. With recurrence rates of 50% and Ki-67 as a key prognostic marker, APA treatment demands personalized, biomarker-guided strategies beyond conventional surgical approaches.",

Advances in statistical methodologies and artificial intelligence (AI) present opportunities to address these inefficiencies. Here we introduce Prognostic Covariate-Adjusted Mixed Models for Repeated Measures (PROCOVA-MMRM) as an advantageous combination of prognostic covariate adjustment (PROCOVA) and Mixed Models for Repeated Measures (MMRM). PROCOVA-MMRM utilizes time-matched prognostic scores generated from AI models to enhance the precision of treatment effect estimators for longitudinal continuous outcomes, enabling reductions in sample size and enrollment times. We first provide a description of the background and implementation of PROCOVA-MMRM, followed by two case study reanalyses where we compare the performance of PROCOVA-MMRM versus the unadjusted MMRM. These reanalyses demonstrate significant improvements in statistical power and precision in clinical indications with unmet medical need, specifically Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). We also explore the potential for sample size reduction with the prospective implementation of PROCOVA-MMRM, finding that the same or better results could have been achieved with fewer participants in these historical trials if the enhanced precision provided by PROCOVA-MMRM had been prospectively leveraged. We also confirm the robustness of the statistical properties of PROCOVA-MMRM in a variety of realistic simulation scenarios. Altogether, PROCOVA-MMRM represents a rigorous method of incorporating advances in the prediction of time-matched prognostic scores generated by AI into longitudinal analysis, potentially reducing both the cost and time required to bring new treatments to patients while adhering to regulatory standards.",

Advanced dual-targeted therapy has emerged as a new treatment option in CD, but no data are available for perianal CD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of advanced dual-targeted therapy for anoperineal fistulas (APFs) in CD patients.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>We prospectively included all consecutive patients receiving an advanced dual-targeted therapy for APFs from August 2019 to December 2023 in a single tertiary perianal CD centre. The primary outcome was clinical effectiveness. Secondary outcomes were patients' treatment perception, radiological effectiveness, luminal disease effectiveness, impact on extra-intestinal manifestations, and safety. Factors associated with complete clinical remission of APFs were identified using logistic regression.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 33 patients were included. The most frequently used advanced dual-targeted therapy was a combination of infliximab and ustekinumab (75.8%). After a median follow-up of 27.4 months, 48.5% and 97.0% of patients were in complete clinical remission and reported a perceived improvement, respectively. Complete radiological remission was achieved in 24.2% of the patients. A concomitant improvement in luminal intestinal involvement was observed in 46.1% of cases, and in extra-digestive manifestations in 45.8% of cases. Treatment tolerance was considered good or very good in 90.9% of cases. Associated anal ulcers and long-term exposure to antibiotics were associated with a lower likelihood of complete clinical remission for fistulas.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These findings suggest that advanced dual-targeted therapy is a valid option with a good safety profile for the treatment of refractory APFs. Larger studies are required to identify the most effective combination.",

Magnetic resonance enterography (MRE), particularly diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), is the preferred cross-sectional technique for assessing small-bowel inflammation. Indices such as the Magnetic Resonance Index of Activity (MaRIA) and its diffusion-weighted variant (DWI MaRIA) are widely used for grading disease activity. This study evaluated whether unsupervised clustering of MRI-derived features can complement these indices by providing more coherent and biologically grounded stratification of disease activity. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> Fifty patients with histologically confirmed CD underwent 1.5 T MRE. Of 349 bowel segments, 84 were pathological and classified using literature-based thresholds (MaRIA, DWI MaRIA) and unsupervised clustering. Differences between inactive, active, and severe disease were analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), analysis of variance (ANOVA), and <i>t</i>-tests. Mahalanobis distances were calculated to quantify and compare separation between categories. <b>Results:</b> Using MaRIA thresholds, 5, 16, and 63 segments were classified as inactive, active, and severe (Mahalanobis distances 2.60, 4.95, 4.12). Clustering redistributed them into 22, 37, and 25 (9.26, 24.22, 15.27).

Wall thickness dominated cluster-derived separation, supported by diffusion metrics and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). <b>Conclusions:</b> Cluster-derived classification yielded clearer and more biologically consistent separation of disease-activity groups than fixed thresholds, emphasizing its potential to refine boundary definition, enhance MRI-based assessment, and inform future AI-driven diagnostic modeling.",

Due to its rarity and complex management, clinical understanding remains limited. This study aimed to analyze the clinical features and surgical outcomes of RGN.<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective analysis was performed utilizing the retroperitoneal tumor database of Peking University International Hospital. Patients who underwent surgical resection for pathologically confirmed primary RGN between January 2015 and August 2024 were included. Systematic postoperative follow-up was conducted to assess outcomes.<h4>Results</h4>Fifty-one consecutive patients (18 males, 33 females; median age 28 years, range 12-73) with newly diagnosed RGN were enrolled. Clinical presentations were heterogeneous: 29 cases (56.9%) were incidental findings on physical examination, 16 (31.4%) reported abdominal discomfort, 3 (5.9%) had lumbago, and single cases presented with hematuria, chest tightness, or lower limb pain. R0/R1 resection was achieved in 45 patients (88.2%). Postoperative complications occurred in 11 patients (21.6%), including gastroparesis (<i>n</i> = 3), pancreatic fistula (<i>n</i> = 3), liver function impairment (<i>n</i> = 2), wound infection (<i>n</i> = 2), and one mortality due to intestinal ischemia and necrosis. Histopathology confirmed GN in all cases. At median follow-up of 62 months (90.2% follow-up rate), no recurrences, metastases, or disease-specific deaths occurred-including in R2 resection patients (<i>n</i> = 6).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Retroperitoneal ganglioneuroma (RGN) is a rare benign tumor that frequently presents with nonspecific symptoms. While surgical resection remains the cornerstone of management, it is best undertaken at specialized, high-volume sarcoma centers to mitigate operative risks. When complete excision is precluded by critical vascular involvement, subtotal resection represents a judicious alternative. For selected patients with small, asymptomatic tumors-particularly those with elevated surgical risk-active surveillance is a reasonable option.

The focus of this review is the clinical and neuroradiological issues in diagnosing SCI and their respective reliability in a clinical setting.

      "abstract": "Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is a type of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technique sensitised to the diffusivity of water molecules, offering the capability to inspect tissue microstructures and is the only in-vivo method to reconstruct white matter fiber tracts non-invasively. The DWI signal can be analysed with the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) model to estimate the directionality of water diffusion within voxels. Several scalar metrics, including axial diffusivity (AD), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), and fractional anisotropy (FA), can be further derived from DTI to quantitatively summarise the microstructural integrity of brain tissue. These scalar metrics have played an important role in understanding the organisation and health of brain tissue at a microscopic level in clinical studies. However, reliable DTI metrics rely on DWI acquisitions with high gradient directions, which often go beyond the commonly used clinical protocols. To enhance the utility of clinically acquired DWI and save scanning time for robust DTI analysis, this work proposes DirGeo-DTI, a deep learning-based method to estimate reliable DTI metrics even from a set of DWIs acquired with the minimum theoretical number (6) of gradient directions. DirGeo-DTI leverages directional encoding and geometric constraints to facilitate the training process. Two public DWI datasets were used for evaluation, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method achieves the best performance compared to existing DTI enhancement methods and potentially reveals further clinical insights with routine clinical DWI scans.",

      "abstract": "Diffusion Tensor Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (DT-CMR) is the only in vivo method to non-invasively examine the microstructure of the human heart. Current research in DT-CMR aims to improve the understanding of how the cardiac microstructure relates to the macroscopic function of the healthy heart as well as how microstructural dysfunction contributes to disease. To get the final DT-CMR metrics, we need to acquire diffusion weighted images of at least 6 directions. However, due to DWI's low signal-to-noise ratio, the standard voxel size is quite big on the scale for microstructures. In this study, we explored the potential of deep-learning-based methods in improving the image quality volumetrically (x4 in all dimensions). This study proposed a novel framework to enable volumetric super-resolution, with an additional model input of high-resolution b0 DWI. We demonstrated that the additional input could offer higher super-resolved image quality. Going beyond, the model is also able to super-resolve DWIs of unseen b-values, proving the model framework's generalizability for cardiac DWI superresolution. In conclusion, we would then recommend giving the model a high-resolution reference image as an additional input to the low-resolution image for training and inference to guide all super-resolution frameworks for parametric imaging where a reference image is available.",

Although cerebrovascular complications are commonly reported, cerebral vasculitis remains an exceedingly rare occurrence and only a limited number of cases have been described. We present the case of a 35-year-old man with CD who presented with acute onset of right-sided hemiparesis, hemiataxia and paresthesias. Laboratory data showed an inflammatory profile. Contrast-enhanced brain magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) with vessel wall imaging well demonstrated focal areas of contrast enhancement in the perforating arteries and distal arterial branches of intracranial vessels, raising the suspicion of a vasculitic process. The patient was then started on high-dose steroid therapy with immediate improvement of the neurological condition. Follow-up brain MRA revealed a significant reduction of the focal contrast-enhancing alterations. If not accurately identified and promptly treated, vasculitic processes may lead to significant disabilities in young patients and should be considered in the differential etiologies of juvenile stroke since symptoms can improve with immunosuppressive treatment. This case highlights the broad spectrum of possible etiologies to be considered in a young patient presenting with an acute onset neurological syndrome and provides a stepwise approach to developing a comprehensive differential diagnosis.",

We aimed to assess the prevalence of SI detected by MRE in a cohort of CD patients, and the associations of SI with demographic and clinical features and with intestinal MRE findings. Two hundred patients affected by CD (M:F 1:1, median age 49.5 (22.5) years, median CD duration 4.75 (16.2) years) tested with MRE between 2011 and 2023 were selected.

Thirty-five percent of patients underwent ileocecal resection. One out of ten patients were treated with at least one TNFαi. Active SI, capsulitis, erosions, sclerosis, and ankylosis were present in 10.5%, 0.5%, 2.0%, 2.5%, and 1.5%, respectively. No significant correlations have been evidenced between the presence of SI and demographic and clinical variables. The presence of an asymmetric hyperenhancement of the bowel wall was instead directly associated with the presence of SI (OR 8.61, 95% CI 1.47-50.4, p = 0.017). In this study, subclinical SI is a frequent finding in CD patients being present in one out of ten MRE examination.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of biologics combined with 16-week EEN in achieving early TH and improving clinical outcomes. This real-world, multicenter retrospective study analyzed medical records of patients with moderate-to-severe CD from 2016 to 2024. Patients received either biologics with concomitant 16-week EEN (BioEEN) or biologics alone (Bio). Clinical and endoscopic outcomes, including transmural healing, were assessed at week 16, year 1, and year 2. At baseline, demographic and clinical characteristics were comparable between the two groups. The BioEEN group demonstrated superior clinical response rates compared to the Bio group (95.1% vs. 70.6% at week 16; P < 0.001), with sustained benefits at week 52 (87.8% vs. 59.5%; P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed higher endoscopic response, mucosal healing, and TH rates in both colorectal and ileal segments at weeks 16 and 52 in the BioEEN group. Additionally, the BioEEN group had significantly lower rates of surgery, escalated treatment, bowel damage progression, and disease relapse at 1 and 2 years. Regression analysis identified the 16-week EEN as the sole protective factor for early transmural healing and improved long-term outcomes. Combined treatment of biologics and 16-week EEN promotes early transmural healing, thereby enhancing long-term clinical outcomes in CD patients.",

Double-balloon endoscopy (DBE) has enabled comprehensive visualization of the small intestinal mucosa. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic efficacy of small-intestine DECTE and DBE for small bowel Crohn's disease (CD).<h4>Methods</h4>This retrospective study was conducted between 1 July 2016 and 1 November 2023 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University. The study included 72 CD patients who underwent both DECTE and DBE, with 4 patients repeating both procedures within 3 months.<h4>Results</h4>The diagnostic rate of small bowel CD using DBE was 80.3%, which was higher than that using DECTE (65.8%, P = 0.044). The combined small bowel CD diagnostic rate was 89.5%, which was higher than that of DECTE alone (P < 0.001). The detection rate of stenosis using DBE was 46.1%, which was higher than that using DECTE (13.2%; P < 0.001). The combined detection rate of stenosis was 52.6%, which was higher than that of DECTE alone (P < 0.001). For ulcers, DBE had a higher detection rate (73.7%) than DECTE (7.9%; P < 0.001). The combined ulcer detection rate was 76.3%, which was higher than that of DECTE alone (P < 0.001). The detection rate of long ulcers (≥ 2 cm) and non-ileocecal ulcers by DBE were both 17.9%. For patients with abdominal pain, DBE had a diagnostic rate of 79.4%, higher than 63.5% of DECTE (χ2 = 3.889, P = 0.049). The combined diagnostic rate was 87.3%, which was higher than that of DECTE alone (χ2 = 9.626, P = 0.002). For patients with diarrhoea, the DBE's diagnostic rates were 86.8% and 68.4% for DECTE (P = 0.097). The combined diagnostic rate was 94.7%, higher than DECTE alone (χ2 = 7.092, P = 0.008). For patients with other symptoms, such as abdominal distension or vomiting, the DBE diagnostic rate was 79.4% compared with 61.8% for DECTE (P = 0.183). The combined diagnostic rate was higher than DECTE alone (χ2 = 6.620, P = 0.010). Furthermore, notable differences in C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, faecal calprotectin, haemoglobin, platelet count, albumin, haematocrit, Crohn's Disease Activity Index scores, and Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease scores were observed between ulcer-positive and ulcer-negative patients detected by DBE (P < 0.05), whereas DECTE did not show significant differences (P > 0.05).<h4>Conclusions</h4>DBE or the combined use of DECTE and DBE provides superior diagnostic performance for small bowel CD, particularly in detecting stenosis and ulcers, compared with DECTE alone. DBE can be used to identify long ulcers and non-ileocecal ulcers. Moreover, DBE helps diagnose small bowel CD across different clinical manifestations and assess disease activity in various inflammatory states.",

However, gadolinium deposition within the brain and body has raised safety concerns about the use of GBCAs. Therefore, the development of novel approaches that can decrease or even eliminate GBCA exposure while providing similar contrast information would be of significant use clinically. \\textit{Methods:} In this work, we present a deep learning based approach for contrast-enhanced T1 synthesis on brain tumor patients. A 3D high-resolution fully convolutional network (FCN), which maintains high resolution information through processing and aggregates multi-scale information in parallel, is designed to map pre-contrast MRI sequences to contrast-enhanced MRI sequences. Specifically, three pre-contrast MRI sequences, T1, T2 and apparent diffusion coefficient map (ADC), are utilized as inputs and the post-contrast T1 sequences are utilized as target output. To alleviate the data imbalance problem between normal tissues and the tumor regions, we introduce a local loss to improve the contribution of the tumor regions, which leads to better enhancement results on tumors. \\textit{Results:} Extensive quantitative and visual assessments are performed, with our proposed model achieving a PSNR of 28.24dB in the brain and 21.2dB in tumor regions. \\textit{Conclusion and Significance:} Our results suggest the potential of substituting GBCAs with synthetic contrast images generated via deep learning.

We found that the prior knowledge of CLIP can effectively discern the quality of degraded images, which can provide reliable guidance. To be specific, We initially learn image-perceptive prompts to distinguish between original and target images using CLIP model, in the meanwhile, we introduce a very simple network by incorporating a simple baseline to predict the weights of three different LUT as enhancement network.

An expert radiologist reviewed MRE for intestinal wall thickening, stricture, abscess formation, fibrofatty proliferation, and fat edema. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to analyze associations between mesenteric fat and outcomes, adjusting for clinical and imaging characteristics.<h4>Results</h4>Among 175 CD patients mesenteric fat proliferation and edema were noted in 52 (29.7%) and 15 (8.9%) patients, respectively.

The participants were divided into two age cohorts: infants (0-12 months) and toddlers (13-36 months). Data were meticulously collected for both cohorts, with anal function assessed through intraoperative anorectal manometry, Masson staining of fistula tissue, and the Heikkinen clinical continence scoring (CCS) scale during the postoperative period RESULTS: (1) Both cohorts demonstrated a 100% postoperative healing rate. The average healing duration was 15.58 ± 3.21 days for the infant cohort and 16.57 ± 3.65 days for the toddler cohort. Anorectal manometry indicated the presence of the anorectal inhibitory reflex (RAIR) in both cohorts. Postfistulotomy, there was a slight decrease in anal rectal pressure (ARP), although this reduction was not statistically significant (p > 0.05) and was unrelated to the complexity of the fistula. Pathological examination of the fistula tissues revealed low muscle content in both cohorts, accounting for 14.1 ± 1.35% in the infant cohort and 17.2 ± 2.86% in the toddler cohort. The muscle composition varied between the cohorts; the infant cohort predominantly had smooth muscle with minimal striated muscle, whereas the toddler cohort had both smooth and striated muscle, with a relatively higher proportion of striated muscle. The CCS scores showed significant improvement at 6 months postoperation and during long-term follow-up compared to preoperative scores, with long-term follow-up results being superior to those at six months (p < 0.01).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Surgical treatment for pediatric anal fistulas demonstrates is both effective and safe, with a potential for long-term improvement in anorectal function over time.",

Various predictive models have been designed to realize its early onset and study the long-term trajectories of cognitive test scores across populations of interest. Research efforts have been geared towards superimposing patients' cognitive test scores with the long-term trajectory denoting gradual cognitive decline, while considering the heterogeneity of AD. Multiple trajectories representing cognitive assessment for the long-term have been developed based on various parameters, highlighting the importance of classifying several groups based on disease progression patterns. In this study, a novel method capable of self-organized prediction, classification, and the overlay of long-term cognitive trajectories based on short-term individual data was developed, based on statistical and differential equation modeling. We validated the predictive accuracy of the proposed method for the long-term trajectory of cognitive test score results on two cohorts: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study and the Japanese ADNI study. We also presented two practical illustrations of the simultaneous evaluation of risk factor associated with both the onset and the longitudinal progression of AD, and an innovative randomized controlled trial design for AD that standardizes the heterogeneity of patients enrolled in a clinical trial. These resources would improve the power of statistical hypothesis testing and help evaluate the therapeutic effect. The application of predicting the trajectory of longitudinal disease progression goes beyond AD, and is especially relevant for progressive and neurodegenerative disorders.",

However, most machine learning approaches developed for prediction of disease progression are either single-task or single-modality models, which can not be directly adopted to our setting involving multi-task learning with high dimensional images. Moreover, most of those approaches are trained on a single dataset (i.e. cohort), which can not be generalized to other cohorts. We propose a novel multimodal multi-task deep learning model to predict AD progression by analyzing longitudinal clinical and neuroimaging data from multiple cohorts. Our proposed model integrates high dimensional MRI features from a 3D convolutional neural network with other data modalities, including clinical and demographic information, to predict the future trajectory of patients. Our model employs an adversarial loss to alleviate the study-specific imaging bias, in particular the inter-study domain shifts. In addition, a Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) optimization technique is applied to further improve model generalization. The proposed model is trained and tested on various datasets in order to evaluate and validate the results. Our results showed that 1) our model yields significant improvement over the baseline models, and 2) models using extracted neuroimaging features from 3D convolutional neural network outperform the same models when applied to MRI-derived volumetric features.",

Each cohort was analyzed under two conditions: one using the full cohort, including cognitively normal controls, and another excluding controls to test subtype robustness. Results confirm the three primary atrophy subtypes identified in earlier studies: Typical, Cortical, and Subcortical, as well as the emergence of rare and atypical AD variants such as posterior cortical atrophy (PCA). Notably, each subtype displayed varying robustness to the inclusion of controls, with certain subtypes, like Subcortical, more influenced by cohort composition. This investigation underscores SuStaIn's reliability for defining stable AD subtypes and suggests its utility in clinical stratification for trials and diagnosis. However, our findings also highlight the need for improved dataset diversity, particularly in terms of ethnic representation, to enhance generalizability and support broader clinical application.",

This study compared the incidence of fistula in ano in patients experiencing their first episode of acute perianal sepsis, with and without antibiotic therapy, and evaluated the prevalence of fistula in ano necessitating surgical intervention at 1 year.<h4>Methods</h4>This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital with a dedicated proctology department. All patients who presented to the emergency proctology unit with a first episode of acute perianal sepsis were eligible for inclusion.<h4>Results</h4>This study included 276 patients. At 1 year, fistula formation was identified in 65.6% of all patients, 54.0% of those who had received antibiotics, and 75.0% of those who had not (P<0.001). This finding remained significant after weighted propensity analysis (odds ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.92; P=0.025).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The rate of fistula formation was relatively high in this study. However, it was lower among patients with perianal sepsis who were treated with antibiotics, although a causal relationship could not be established. Prolonged follow-up is needed to clarify the role of antibiotic therapy in preventing or delaying fistula development in patients with acute perianal sepsis.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Fecal calprotectin (FC) is a reliable biomarker widely used for assessing disease activity and postoperative monitoring in patients with Crohn's disease (CD); however, its efficacy in patients with an ileostomy is poorly understood. Our study evaluated whether FC from the ileostomy output can be used to predict postoperative small bowel inflammation in patients with CD.<h4>Methods</h4>Data from patients with CD and an ileostomy who had undergone FC measurement between January 1, 2015, and December 30, 2022, were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were enrolled in the study if they had undergone FC tests with concurrent imaging and/or endoscopic studies, facilitating comparison between FC tests and imaging and/or endoscopic examinations. FC measured with the point-of care (POC) test was denoted as FC-POCT, and that measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was denoted as FC-ELISA.<h4>Results</h4>This study analyzed 101 patients and 224 FC test results. FC concentration differed significantly in patients with signs of small bowel inflammation on imaging and/or ileoscopy compared with those in remission (FC-POCT: median 191.0 µg/g; interquartile range [IQR], 94.6-499.0 µg/g vs. 29.9 µg/g; IQR, 29.9-50.0 µg/g; P < 0.001; FC-ELISA: median 252.5 µg/g; IQR, 118.5-911.0 µg/g vs. 16.8 µg/g, IQR, 8.2-33.0 µg/g; P < 0.001). The optimal cutoff value for FC-POCT and FC-ELISA to distinguish between small bowel inflammation and remission was 63.3 µg/g (area under the curve [AUC], 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88-0.97) and 40.1 µg/g (AUC, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.79-0.99), respectively. We also compared the diagnostic accuracy between the POC and ELISA testing methods and found no statistically significant difference (P = 0.692).<h4>Conclusions</h4>FC from the ileostomy output is a valuable biomarker with high sensitivity and specificity for monitoring small bowel inflammation in postoperative patients with CD and an ileostomy.",

The intestinal and perianal imaging signs were evaluated. Visceral fat information from CT images was extracted, including the ratio of visceral to subcutaneous fat volume (VSR), fat distribution, and attenuation values. The valuable indicators were screened out in the derivation cohort by binary logistic regression and receiver working curve (ROC) analysis to construct an imaging report and data system for IBD (IBD-RADS), which was tested in the validation cohort.<h4>Results</h4>The derivation cohort included 606 patients (365 CD, 241 UC), and the validation cohort included 155 patients (97 CD, 58 UC). Asymmetric enhancement (AE) (OR = 87.75 [28.69, 268.4]; P < 0.001), perianal fistula (OR = 4.968 [1.807, 13.66]; P = 0.002) and VSR (OR = 1.571 [1.087, 2.280]; P = 0.04) were independent predictors of CD. VSR improved the efficiency of imaging signs (AUC: 0.929 vs. 0.901; P < 0.001), with a threshold greater than 0.97 defined as visceral fat predominance (VFP). In IBD-RADS, AE was the major criterion, VFP and perianal fistula were auxiliary criteria, and intestinal fistula, limited small bowel disease, and skip distribution were special favoring items as their 100% specificity. Grade 3 to 5 correctly classified most CD patients (derivation: 96.5% (352/365), validation: 98.0% (95/97)), and 98% of those were eventually diagnosed with CD (derivation: 97.8% (352/360), validation: 98.0% (95/97)).<h4>Conclusions</h4>IBD-RADS can help radiologists distinguish between CD and UC in patients with suspected IBD.",

The risk of bias was evaluated using the QUADAS-2 tool. Five eligible studies, encompassing 468 subjects, were identified. Our study suggests that diverse deep learning applications, including image quality enhancement, bowel segmentation for disease burden quantification, and 3D reconstruction for surgical planning are useful and promising for CD assessment. However, most of the studies are preliminary, retrospective studies, and have a high risk of bias in at least one category. Future research is needed to assess how deep learning can impact CD patient diagnostics, particularly when considering the increasing integration of such models into hospital systems.",

Two radiologists independently assessed the images for overall image quality, contrast, sharpness, presence of motion artifacts, blurring, and synthetic appearance for qualitative analysis, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was measured for quantitative analysis.<h4>Results</h4>The mean scores of the DLR image set with respect to overall image quality, contrast, sharpness, motion artifacts, and blurring in the coronal and axial images were significantly superior to those of both the filtered and original images (<i>P</i> < 0.001). However, the DLR images showed a significantly more synthetic appearance than the other two images (<i>P</i> < 0.05).

In the diagnostic test accuracy study, the primary outcome is a successful diagnosis using one or more novel index tests at baseline compared with the ECCO criteria as the reference standard. The composite outcome of the prognostic utility study is 'severe IBD' within 52 weeks from inclusion, defined as one or more of the following three events: IBD-related surgery, IBD-related hospitalisation or IBD-related death.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>We aim to recruit 800 patients referred on suspicion of IBD to this longitudinal observational study, a collaboration between 11 inclusion sites in Denmark, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. Inclusion will occur from February 2022 until December 2023 with screening and baseline visits for all participants and three outcome visits at weeks 12, 26 and 52 after baseline for IBD-diagnosed patients.

Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) were segmented using three approaches: (1) whole-abdomen segmentation (T-VAT/SAT); (2) single-slice segmentation of adipose tissue surrounding the most severely affected bowel segment (LL-VAT/SAT); and (3) single-slice segmentation at individual vertebral levels from L3 to S2 (V-VAT/SAT).

DCA further demonstrated that the combined model provided greater net clinical benefit compared with both the T-VAT and clinical models.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Radiomics based on whole-abdominal VAT segmentation achieved the best prognostic performance for predicting disease progression in CD.

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Following atrial fibrillation ablation, it is challenging to distinguish patients who will remain arrhythmia-free from those at risk for recurrence. New explainable machine learning (xML) techniques allow for systematic assessment of arrhythmia recurrence risk following catheter ablation. We aim to develop an xML algorithm that predicts recurrence and reveals key risk factors to facilitate better follow-up strategy after an ablation procedure.<h4>Methods</h4>We reconstructed pre-and post-ablation models of the left atrium (LA) from late gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance (LGE-MRI) for 67 patients. Patient-specific features (LGE-based measurements of pre/post-ablation arrhythmogenic substrate, LA geometry metrics, computational simulation results, and clinical risk factors) trained a random forest classifier to predict recurrent arrhythmia. We calculated each risk factor's marginal contribution to model decision making via SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP).<h4>Results</h4>The classifier accurately predicts post-ablation arrhythmia recurrence (mean receiver operating characteristic [ROC] area under the curve [AUC]: 0.80 ± 0.04; mean precision-recall [PR] AUC: 0.82 ± 0.08). SHAP analysis reveals that of 89 features tested, the key population risk factors for recurrence are: large left atrium, low LGE-quantified post-ablation scar in the atrial floor region, and previous attempts at direct current cardioversion. We also examine patient-specific recurrence predictions, since xML allows us to understand why a particular individual can have large prediction weights for some categories without tipping the balance towards an incorrect prediction. Finally, we validate our model in a completely new, 15-patient retrospective holdout cohort (80% correct).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our SHAP-based explainable machine learning approach is a proof-of-concept clinical tool to explain arrhythmia recurrence risk in patients who underwent ablation by combining patient-specific clinical profiles and LGE-derived data.",

Five studies investigated AI models for predicting hepatobiliary toxicity following SBRT for liver tumors. Sixteen studies involved SRS-treated patients with brain metastases or benign intracranial neoplasms (e.g., arteriovenous malformations, vestibular schwannomas, meningiomas), exploring AI algorithms for predicting treatment response and radiation-induced changes. In the results, AI might have been exploited to both reaffirm already known clinical predictors and to identify novel imaging, dosimetric or biological biomarkers. Examples include predicting radiation pneumonitis in lung cancer, residual liver function in hepatic tumors and local recurrence in brain metastases, thus supporting tailored treatment decisions. <b>Conclusions:</b> Combining AI with SBRT could greatly enhance personalized cancer care by predicting patient-specific outcomes and toxicity. AI models analyze complex datasets, including imaging and clinical data, to identify patterns that traditional methods may miss, thus enabling more accurate risk stratification and reducing variability in treatment planning. With further research and clinical validation, this integration could make radiotherapy safer, more effective and contribute to advancement in precision oncology.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>This narrative review examines the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in bowel sound analysis for the diagnosis and management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, presents a significant clinical burden due to its unpredictable course, variable symptomatology, and reliance on invasive procedures for diagnosis and disease monitoring. Despite advances in imaging and biomarkers, tools such as colonoscopy and fecal calprotectin remain costly, uncomfortable, and impractical for frequent or real-time assessment. Meanwhile, bowel sounds-an overlooked physiologic signal-reflect underlying gastrointestinal motility and inflammation but have historically lacked objective quantification. With recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and acoustic signal processing, there is growing interest in leveraging bowel sound analysis as a novel, non-invasive biomarker for detecting IBD, monitoring disease activity, and predicting disease flares. This approach holds the promise of continuous, low-cost, and patient-friendly monitoring, which could transform IBD management.<h4>Objectives</h4>This narrative review assesses the clinical utility, methodological rigor, and potential future integration of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven bowel sound analysis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), with a focus on its potential as a non-invasive biomarker for disease activity, flare prediction, and differential diagnosis.<h4>Methods</h4>This manuscript reviews the potential of AI-powered bowel sound analysis as a non-invasive tool for diagnosing, monitoring, and managing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as colonoscopy and biomarkers, are often invasive, costly, and impractical for real-time monitoring. The manuscript explores bowel sounds, which reflect gastrointestinal motility and inflammation, as an alternative biomarker by utilizing AI techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transformers, and gradient boosting. We analyze data on acoustic signal acquisition (e.g., smart T-shirts, smartphones), signal processing methodologies (e.g., MFCCs, spectrograms, empirical mode decomposition), and validation metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1 scores, AUC). Studies were assessed for clinical relevance, methodological rigor, and translational potential.<h4>Results</h4>Across studies enrolling 16-100 participants, AI models achieved diagnostic accuracies of 88-96%, with AUCs ≥ 0.83 and F1 scores ranging from 0.71 to 0.85 for differentiating IBD from healthy controls and IBS. Transformer-based approaches (e.g., HuBERT, Wav2Vec 2.0) consistently outperformed CNNs and tabular models, yielding F1 scores of 80-85%, while gradient boosting on wearable multi-microphone recordings demonstrated robustness to background noise. Distinct acoustic signatures were identified, including prolonged sound-to-sound intervals in Crohn's disease (mean 1232 ms vs. 511 ms in IBS) and high-pitched tinkling in stricturing phenotypes. Despite promising performance, current models remain below established biomarkers such as fecal calprotectin (~90% sensitivity for active disease), and generalizability is limited by small, heterogeneous cohorts and the absence of prospective validation.<h4>Conclusions</h4>AI-powered bowel sound analysis represents a promising, non-invasive tool for IBD monitoring. However, widespread clinical integration requires standardized data acquisition protocols, large multi-center datasets with clinical correlates, explainable AI frameworks, and ethical data governance. Future directions include wearable-enabled remote monitoring platforms and multi-modal decision support systems integrating bowel sounds with biomarker and symptom data. This manuscript emphasizes the need for large-scale, multi-center studies, the development of explainable AI frameworks, and the integration of these tools within clinical workflows. Future directions include remote monitoring using wearables and multi-modal systems that combine bowel sounds with biomarkers and patient symptoms, aiming to transform IBD care into a more personalized and proactive model.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Disease-related strictures are a common complication of Crohn's disease (CD). Cross-sectional imaging is widely used for their assessment, but definitions remain variable and non-standardised. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to identify commonly used imaging parameters, assess diagnostic performance, and evaluate consistency across studies.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a systematic review of ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT) studies on CD-associated strictures, searching MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane to January 1, 2025. We included prospective and retrospective studies of small-bowel CD strictures with surgical histopathology as reference standard. Summary data were extracted from published reports and pooled using a random-effects bivariate meta-analysis, which jointly models sensitivity and specificity while accounting for between-study heterogeneity. Exclusion criteria were pediatric populations, colonic and upper-GI strictures. Main outcomes were stricture definitions and diagnostic performance. The study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD420251032918.<h4>Findings</h4>Of the 9436 articles identified through the search, 30 met eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis, comprising 1866 patients with CD: 5 on US, 7 on CT, 8 on MRI, and the remaining assessed two techniques. Luminal narrowing (LN), bowel wall thickening (BWT), and pre-stenotic dilation (PSD) were the most common descriptors. 4 studies (13%) required all three; the remaining used LN or BWT alone, with PSD often considered optional (20/30 [77%]). Overall, 26.7% (8/30) of studies were judged at high or unclear risk of bias in at least one domain. Pooled sensitivity and specificity for US techniques to detect strictures were 0.88 (95% CI, 0.83-0.91) and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.79-0.91) (<i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0%), respectively. Pooled sensitivity and specificity for MRE were 0.82 (95% CI, 0.69-0.90) and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.44-0.95) (<i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 61.2%), and for CTE were 0.83 (95% CI, 0.73-0.90) and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.47-0.93) (<i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 58.8%), respectively.<h4>Interpretation</h4>High diagnostic accuracy was observed across imaging modalities, with no statistically significant difference among them, and only a minority of studies at risk of bias unlikely to affect these findings. Heterogeneity existed in cut-offs and parameter combinations used to define strictures. PSD does not appear essential for stricture diagnosis, which could simplify diagnostic protocols. Variations in histological criteria and limited evidence for some modalities may limit generalizability.<h4>Funding</h4>None.",

      "abstract": "The study aims were to develop fracture prediction models by using machine learning approaches and genomic data, as well as to identify the best modeling approach for fracture prediction. The genomic data of Osteoporotic Fractures in Men, cohort Study (n = 5,130), was analyzed. After a comprehensive genotype imputation, genetic risk score (GRS) was calculated from 1,103 associated SNPs for each participant. Data were normalized and split into a training set (80%) and a validation set (20%) for analysis. Random forest, gradient boosting, neural network, and logistic regression were used to develop prediction models for major osteoporotic fractures separately, with GRS, bone density and other risk factors as predictors. For model training, the synthetic minority over-sampling technique was used to account for low fracture rate, and 10-fold cross-validation was employed for hyperparameters optimization. In the testing set, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and accuracy were used to assess the model performance. The McNemar test was employed for pairwise comparisons to examine the accuracy difference between models. The results showed that the prediction performance of gradient boosting was the best, with AUC of 0.71 and an accuracy of 0.88, and the GRS ranked as the 7th most important variable in the model. The performance of random forest and neural network were also better than that of logistic regression. Pairwise comparisons showed that the accuracy difference between models was significant. This study suggested that improving fracture prediction can be achieved by incorporating genetic profiling and by utilizing the gradient boosting approach.",

Here, reporting resonant X-ray scattering experiments on the layered Van der Waals compound $1T$-TiSe$_2$, we establish the emergence of orbital order in a weakly correlated, quasi-two-dimensional material. Our experimental scattering results are consistent with first-principles calculations that bring to the fore a generic mechanism of close interplay between charge redistribution, lattice displacements, and orbital order.

Recently, there have been some efforts towards understanding these effects using states with a low principal quantum number that only have resonant dipole-dipole interactions. We perform experiments that exhibit black-body-induced dipole-dipole interactions for a state that also has a significant van der Waals interaction. Using an enhanced rate-equation model that captures some of the long-range properties of the dipolar interaction, we show that the initial degree of Rydberg excitation is dominated by the van der Waals interaction, while the observed linewidth at later times is dominated by the dipole-dipole interaction. We also point out some prospects for quantum simulation.",

The governing equations are formulated for any thermodynamic model with two intensive degrees of freedom, applied with the van der Waals' model and solved numerically in nondimensional form by finite-difference algorithms. After a brief summary of thermodynamic characteristics possessed by the van der Waals' model, and relevant to the present study, we proceed to the description of the results in terms of comparative graphs illustrating radial profiles of density, pressure and gravitational field. We complement them with graphs that compare the dependence of central and wall densities on gravitational number for both perfect-gas and van der Waals' models and that attest dramatically and unequivocally how the presence of molecular-attraction and -size terms removes questionable fluid-statics results systematically found accompanying the perfect-gas model in standard treatments. We also describe, within a very brief and preliminary digression, how the sanitising action of the mentioned terms affects the thermodynamics of the isothermal sphere by providing evidence of how the gravitational correction to entropy corresponding to the van der Waals' model makes sure that there is no risk of gravothermal catastrophes, negative specific heats, and thermal instabilities. Furthermore, we investigate the phenomenology related to self-gravitationally induced both liquid-gas phase equilibria and metastable-gas states and we describe how they arise naturally and self-consistently from the governing equations.

An analysis of the optical conductivity suggests that below 150 K a reduction in the available phase space for scattering takes place, resulting in long-lived quasiparticle excitations. We suggest that this reduction in phase space provides experimental evidence for a van Hove singularity close to the Fermi level. Our data furthermore indicates a very weak electron-phonon coupling.

It had developed under the founder Jacobus Cornelius Kapteyn into one of the leading astronomical research institutes in the world. When van Rhijn took over at the retirement of Kapteyn, it was in the process of coordinating Kapteyn's Plan of Selected Areas. Van Rhijn's research was solid and professional work, but in his papers he invariably stopped before discussing how his findings did fit into the larger scheme of things. He maybe was unimaginative but it did lack the link to the larger view towards the emerging picture of the structure of the Galaxy. Van Rhijn was unfortunate to be hampered throughout almost his complete directorate by factors, that severely limited his attempts to obtain more funding in spite of local support by his university. These were of course in the first place the Great Depression of the 1930s and the Second World War and its aftermath, while during most of the 1940s he suffered from tuberculosis. But also the remote location of Groningen compared to Leiden, where a major infrastructure led by three important protegees of Kapteyn was in place, and the governmental bias towards support for Leiden over Groningen was an important factor. Finally I examine the developments in the 1950s and the circumstances that made Adriaan Blaauw accept his appointment as van Rhijn's successor in 1957 and initiate the beginnings of the revival under his leadership.",

A modified Delphi process was used to refine statements and gain agreement from 54 Japanese specialists at in-person and online meetings conducted between October 2020 and April 2021.<h4>Results</h4>Seventeen statements were developed for treatment intensification in luminal CD (targeting endoscopic remission), six statements for treatment intensification in perianal/fistulizing CD (targeting healing of perianal lesions and complete closure of the fistula), six statements for treatment intensification in CD with small bowel stenosis (targeting resolution of obstructive symptoms), seven statements for treatment intensification after surgery (targeting endoscopic remission), and five statements for discontinuing or reducing the dose of treatment in patients with CD.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These statements provide guidance on how and when to intensify or de-intensify treatment for a broad spectrum of patients with CD.",

This is a serious omission, because in rule-based policy or contract representation languages rules are being used as a declarative programming language to formalize real-world decision logic and create IS production systems upon. This paper adopts an SE methodology from extreme programming, namely test driven development, and discusses how it can be adapted to verification, validation and integrity testing (V&V&I) of policy and contract specifications. Since, the test-driven approach focuses on the behavioral aspects and the drawn conclusions instead of the structure of the rule base and the causes of faults, it is independent of the complexity of the rule language and the system under test and thus much easier to use and understand for the rule engineer and the user.",

In this thesis, we investigate the role of submodularity in provable non-convex optimization and validation of algorithms. A profound understanding which classes of functions can be tractably optimized remains a central challenge for non-convex optimization. By advancing the notion of submodularity to continuous domains (termed \"continuous submodularity\"), we characterize a class of generally non-convex and non-concave functions -- continuous submodular functions, and derive algorithms for approximately maximizing them with strong approximation guarantees. Meanwhile, continuous submodularity captures a wide spectrum of applications, ranging from revenue maximization with general marketing strategies, MAP inference for DPPs to mean field inference for probabilistic log-submodular models, which renders it as a valuable domain knowledge in optimizing this class of objectives. Validation of algorithms is an information-theoretic framework to investigate the robustness of algorithms to fluctuations in the input/observations and their generalization ability. We investigate various algorithms for one of the paradigmatic unconstrained submodular maximization problem: MaxCut. Due to submodularity of the MaxCut objective, we are able to present efficient approaches to calculate the algorithmic information content of MaxCut algorithms. The results provide insights into the robustness of different algorithmic techniques for MaxCut.",

      "abstract": "Changes to hyperparameters can have a dramatic effect on model accuracy. Thus, the tuning of hyperparameters plays an important role in optimizing machine-learning models. An integral part of the hyperparameter-tuning process is the evaluation of model checkpoints, which is done through the use of \"validators\". In a supervised setting, these validators evaluate checkpoints by computing accuracy on a validation set that has labels. In contrast, in an unsupervised setting, the validation set has no such labels. Without any labels, it is impossible to compute accuracy, so validators must estimate accuracy instead. But what is the best approach to estimating accuracy? In this paper, we consider this question in the context of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Specifically, we propose three new validators, and we compare and rank them against five other existing validators, on a large dataset of 1,000,000 checkpoints. Extensive experimental results show that two of our proposed validators achieve state-of-the-art performance in various settings. Finally, we find that in many cases, the state-of-the-art is obtained by a simple baseline method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest empirical study of UDA validators to date.

We show that the marginal likelihood is formally equivalent to exhaustive leave-$p$-out cross-validation averaged over all values of $p$ and all held-out test sets when using the log posterior predictive probability as the scoring rule. Moreover, the log posterior predictive is the only coherent scoring rule under data exchangeability. This offers new insight into the marginal likelihood and cross-validation and highlights the potential sensitivity of the marginal likelihood to the choice of the prior. We suggest an alternative approach using cumulative cross-validation following a preparatory training phase.

      "doi": "",
      "abstract": "The safety validation of automatic emergency braking system (AEBS) requires accurately distinguishing between false positive (FP) and true positive (TP) system activations. While simulations allow straightforward differentiation by comparing scenarios with and without interventions, analyzing activations from open-loop resimulations - such as those from field operational testing (FOT) - is more complex. This complexity arises from scenario parameter uncertainty and the influence of driver interventions in the recorded data. Human labeling is frequently used to address these challenges, relying on subjective assessments of intervention necessity or situational criticality, potentially introducing biases and limitations. This work proposes a rule-based classification approach leveraging the Prediction Divergence Principle (PDP) to address those issues. Applied to a simplified AEBS, the proposed method reveals key strengths, limitations, and system requirements for effective implementation. The findings suggest that combining this approach with human labeling may enhance the transparency and consistency of classification, thereby improving the overall validation process. While the rule set for classification derived in this work adopts a conservative approach, the paper outlines future directions for refinement and broader applicability. Finally, this work highlights the potential of such methods to complement existing practices, paving the way for more reliable and reproducible AEBS validation frameworks.",

This is particularly relevant for transient and transitional flow problems, as well as for the improvement of turbulence models. We start by presenting a literature survey of results obtained with distinct SRS models for flows past circular cylinders. It confirms the importance of V&V by illustrating a large variability of results, which is independent of the selected mathematical model and Reynolds number. The proposed V&V strategy is then used on three representative problems of practical interest. The results illustrate that it is possible to conduct reliable verification and validation exercises with SRS models, and evidence the importance of V&V to predictive SRS of turbulence. Most notably, the data also confirm the advantages and potential of the proposed V&V strategy: separate assessment of numerical and modeling errors, enhanced flow physics analysis, identification of key flow phenomena, and ability to operate when the exact flow conditions are unknown or reference data are unavailable.",

Clinical trials in pfCD are increasingly using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) criteria as a primary endpoint, but there is heterogeneity in the radiological definition of a healed perianal fistula that currently limits our ability to perform meaningful meta-analyses of studies. Our aim is to standardise outcomes through the generation of an international consensus definition of a radiologically healed fistula.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>This international Delphi consensus study employs a two-part strategy.The first is a systematic review to identify a longlist of variables used to define radiological healing in pfCD. MRI-based indices used to score fistula severity and healing will be assessed for their methodological quality using Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN). The systematic review protocol will be conducted using COSMIN methodology and reported using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses.The second part will be an online Delphi consensus, guided by the results of the systematic review. Radiologists, gastroenterologists and colorectal surgeons with expertise in the management of pfCD will be invited to take part in two to three rounds of online surveys. Once an a priori threshold of >80% agreement is reached on individual radiological components used to define 'healing' and 'healed', a final meeting of key stakeholders will be organised to generate a consensus definition of a healed fistula.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>The study has been deemed exempt from a formal Research Ethics Committee review as no patients will participate directly in the consensus process, given the technical nature of the research question. The study is registered with the local R&D department (Reference RD24/007). Publication of this study will help standardise radiological endpoint measurement in clinical trials of pfCD and improve the synthesis and meta-analysis of comparative studies.<h4>Prospero registration number</h4>CRD42024504334.",

We aimed to identify how MH is defined in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD).<h4>Methods</h4>We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library from inception to December 2023 for phase 2 and 3 RCTs of advanced therapies in IBD.<h4>Results</h4>One hundred forty-four studies were included, 72 in UC and 72 in CD, published between 1997 and 2023. In UC, 64% (46/72) RCTs reported MH as an endpoint. 12 definitions of MH were found, from endoscopic assessment alone (35/46; 76%) to the more recent combination of histology and endoscopy (10/46; 22%). 96% (44/46) of studies used the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore. In CD, reporting of MH lagged behind UC, with only 12% (9/72) of trials specifically defining MH as an endpoint, 7 as \"absence of ulceration,\" 2 as Simplified Endoscopic Score for CD score ≤2 or 0. Histological assessment was performed in 3 RCTs of CD. Centralized reading of endoscopy was used in 48% (35/72) of RCTs of UC and 22% (16/72) of CD. Only 1 RCT included transmural healing as an endpoint.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A standard definition of MH in IBD is lacking. Definitions have evolved particularly in UC, which now includes the addition of histological evaluation. Transmural healing holds promise as a future target in CD. We support a greater standardization of definitions as we expect endpoints to become increasingly stringent and multimodal with computers automating the assessment.",

Our model requires magnitude images only for training, and yet is able to reconstruct complex-valued data, and even extends to parallel imaging.

Also, due to its generative nature, our approach can quantify uncertainty, which is not possible with standard regression settings.

There is however a strong dependence of maximum wall shear stress on We, with values for the viscoelastic fluid in all cases being higher than that for the Newtonian case.",

      "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) requires long acquisition times, raising costs, reducing accessibility, and making scans more susceptible to motion artifacts. Diffusion probabilistic models that learn data-driven priors can potentially assist in reducing acquisition time. However, they typically require large training datasets that can be prohibitively expensive to collect. Patch-based diffusion models have shown promise in learning effective data-driven priors over small real-valued datasets, but have not yet demonstrated clinical value in MRI. We extend the Patch-based Diffusion Inverse Solver (PaDIS) to complex-valued, multi-coil MRI reconstruction, and compare it against a state-of-the-art whole-image diffusion baseline (FastMRI-EDM) for 7x undersampled MRI reconstruction on the FastMRI brain dataset. We show that PaDIS-MRI models trained on small datasets of as few as 25 k-space images outperform FastMRI-EDM on image quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM, NRMSE), pixel-level uncertainty, cross-contrast generalization, and robustness to severe k-space undersampling. In a blinded study with three radiologists, PaDIS-MRI reconstructions were chosen as diagnostically superior in 91.7% of cases, compared to baselines (i) FastMRI-EDM and (ii) classical convex reconstruction with wavelet sparsity. These findings highlight the potential of patch-based diffusion priors for high-fidelity MRI reconstruction in data-scarce clinical settings where diagnostic confidence matters.",

      "abstract": "Over the past several decades, many different types of computational imaging approaches have been proposed for improving MRI. In this paper, we provide an overview of methods that assume that MRI Fourier data is linearly predictable. Linear prediction is well known in signal processing and may be most recognizable for its usefulness in speech processing and spectrum estimation applications. In MRI, linear predictability implies that data can be sampled below the conventional Nyquist rate, since unmeasured data may be imputed as a shift-invariant linear combination of measured samples. Linear predictive methods include some of the earliest methods in the computational MRI reconstruction field, some of the most widely utilized computational MRI methods in modern clinical practice, and some of the most flexible and versatile modern computational imaging approaches that are enabling unprecedented new styles of data acquisition. In addition, the concept of linear predictability can be used to unify a number of more classical MRI reconstruction constraints, but without needing to make the strong assumptions of classical constrained reconstruction methods.",

      "abstract": "Presently, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) magnets must deliver excellent magnetic field (B0) uniformity to achieve optimum image quality. Long magnets can satisfy the homogeneity requirements but require considerable superconducting material. These designs result in large, heavy, costly, and unstable systems that aggravate as field strength increases. This issue is a crucial factor in the disparity of MR density and field strength use across the globe. Low-income settings show reduced access to MRI, especially to high field strengths. This article summarizes the proposed modifications to MRI superconducting magnet design and their impact on accessibility, including compact, reduced liquid Helium and specialty systems. Reducing the amount of superconductor inevitably entails shrinking the magnet size, resulting in higher field inhomogeneity. This work also reviews the state-of-the-art imaging and reconstruction methods to overcome this issue. Finally, we summarize the current and future challenges and opportunities in the design of accessible MRI.",

In ulcerative colitis, it enables accurate assessment of rectal wall thickness and vascularity, which correlate closely with both endoscopic and histological inflammation. This makes it a practical alternative to sigmoidoscopy, especially in settings such as pregnancy, childhood, or long-term disease monitoring. In Crohn's disease, TPUS offers high diagnostic accuracy for detecting, classifying, and monitoring perianal fistulas and abscesses. It is also effective for evaluating rectovaginal fistulas and pouch-related complications following restorative proctocolectomy. Advancements such as color Doppler imaging, contrast-enhanced ultrasound, three-dimensional reconstruction, and computer-assisted grayscale analysis further enhance its diagnostic and functional capabilities. Compared to magnetic resonance imaging and endoscopic ultrasound, TPUS serves as a practical, patient-friendly, and cost-effective frontline or complementary imaging tool for comprehensive disease evaluation and treatment planning-particularly useful in children, pregnant women, and resource-limited settings. Its bedside feasibility, repeatability, and expanding role in treatment monitoring underscore its value in modern IBD care pathways.",

Consensus was defined when ⩾70% of panellists agreed with a statement, rated using a 7-point Likert scale. We also analysed the associated annual costs for partial responders and patients in remission according to the agreed long-term definitions, based on a literature review and the experience of the scientific committee. Medication costs were excluded from the analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Sixty Spanish gastroenterologists with extensive experience in IBD management participated in the consultation. Consensus was achieved on partial response definitions with different criteria over time, including clinical scores, biomarkers and imaging or endoscopic examinations. The annual cost for partial responders and patients in remission was estimated at €2570.40 and €820.20 for UC, €1607.30 and €718.0 for luminal CD and €2886.70 and €888.80 for perianal CD, respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The concept of partial responders has been defined in four clinical scenarios.

Intestinal ultrasound [IUS] is an attractive, non-invasive alternative to endoscopy, demonstrating early transmural changes after treatment initiation. Therefore, we investigated IUS and contrast-enhanced ultrasound [CEUS] to predict [early] endoscopic treatment response.<h4>Methods</h4>Consecutive patients with endoscopically active CD, starting anti-TNFα therapy, were included. Clinical, biochemical, IUS, and CEUS parameters at baseline [T0], after 4-8 weeks [T1] and 12-34 weeks [T2] were collected. The most severely inflamed segment at endoscopy (highest segmental Simplified Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease [SES-CD]) and IUS (highest segmental bowel wall thickness [BWT]) was identified. At T2, endoscopic response [decrease in SES-CD ≥ 50%] and remission [SES-CD = 0] were scored.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 40 patients were included: 14 reached endoscopic remission and 17 endoscopic response. At T1 (3.1 mm [1.9-4.2] vs 5.3 mm [3.8-6.9], p = 0.005) and T2 (2.0 mm [1.8-3.1] vs 5.1 [3.0-6.3] mm, p = 0.002) BWT was lower in patients with endoscopic remission. At T1 and T2, 18% (area under the receiver operating curve [AUROC]: 0.77; odds ratio [OR]: 10.80, p = 0.012) and 29% [AUROC: 0.833; OR: 37.50, p = 0.006] BWT decrease predicted endoscopic response, respectively. To determine endoscopic remission, BWT 3.2 mm was most accurate [AUROC: 0.94; OR: 39.42, p < 0.0001] at T2. In addition, absence of colour Doppler signal [OR: 13.76, p = 0.03] and the CEUS parameter wash-out rate [OR: 0.76, p = 0.019] improved the prediction model.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Reduction in BWT, already after 4-8 weeks of follow-up, predicted endoscopic response and remission.

      "abstract": "Magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) is a non-invasive, radiation-free imaging modality that facilitates the assessment of transmural Crohn's disease activity. It offers advantages over ileo-colonoscopy, which is limited to mucosal-level evaluation, cannot routinely assess small bowel segments proximal to the terminal ileum, and is unable to detect extra-luminal complications. Despite these advantages, the lack of standardised criteria for defining and appraising radiologic disease activity on MRE has contributed to variability in interpretation and clinical application. In response, multiple MRE-based scoring systems have been developed to quantify radiological Crohn's disease activity in both luminal and post-operative settings. Radiological disease activity scores specific to luminal Crohn's disease include the magnetic resonance index of activity (MaRIA), simplified MaRIA, Nancy score, London score, Crohn's disease magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) index, Clermont score, paediatric inflammatory Crohn's MRE index, MRE global score, MRE index, and modified Clermont score. The MR score and the MRI in Crohn's disease to predict postoperative recurrence index have been specifically developed to evaluate post-operative disease recurrence in Crohn's disease. Nevertheless, heterogeneity in scoring parameters, variability in computational complexity, and a lack of consensus regarding optimal score selection, have impeded widespread clinical adoption of radiological disease activity scores. This narrative review aims to summarise the key imaging features of luminal Crohn's disease, explore their integration into existing MRE scoring indices, and critically compare the structure, strengths, and clinical applicability of each. Furthermore, MRI scores specific to post-operative Crohn's disease evaluation, and the assessment of cumulative bowel wall damage using the Lemann index will also be discussed.",

Imaging techniques play a crucial role in diagnosis, monitoring disease activity, and guiding therapeutic response. This review summarizes the current evidence on radiologic imaging techniques in IBD, focusing on intestinal ultrasound (IUS), computed tomography enterography (CTE), magnetic resonance enterography (MRE), and other emerging technologies.<h4>Methods</h4>A literature review was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library, encompassing publications up to 31 October 2024.<h4>Results</h4>IUS offers a non-invasive tool for assessing bowel wall thickness, vascularity, and complications. CTE and MRE provide detailed visualization of luminal and extraluminal disease, with MRE preferred for routine monitoring due to the absence of ionizing radiation. Standardized indices and scoring systems aid in objective disease activity assessment. Emerging technologies like Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/MRI and radiomics show promise in combining metabolic and morphological information for complex cases.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Imaging has a central role in IBD management, with IUS, CTE, and MRE demonstrating high diagnostic accuracy. Radiomics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are paving the way for precision imaging. Integrating advanced imaging techniques, scoring systems, and AI-driven analytics represents a transformative step toward more effective and individualized care for patients with IBD.",

      "abstract": "The rising incidence of pancreatic diseases, including acute and chronic pancreatitis and various pancreatic neoplasms, poses a significant global health challenge. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) for example, has a high mortality rate due to late-stage diagnosis and its inaccessible location. Advances in imaging technologies, though improving diagnostic capabilities, still necessitate biopsy confirmation. Artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning and deep learning, has emerged as a revolutionary force in healthcare, enhancing diagnostic precision and personalizing treatment. This narrative review explores Artificial intelligence's role in pancreatic imaging, its technological advancements, clinical applications, and associated challenges. Following the PRISMA-DTA guidelines, a comprehensive search of databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library was conducted, focusing on Artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, and radiomics in pancreatic imaging. Articles involving human subjects, written in English, and published up to March 31, 2024, were included. The review process involved title and abstract screening, followed by full-text review and refinement based on relevance and novelty. Recent Artificial intelligence advancements have shown promise in detecting and diagnosing pancreatic diseases. Deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been effective in detecting and segmenting pancreatic tissues as well as differentiating between benign and malignant lesions. Deep learning algorithms have also been used to predict survival time, recurrence risk, and therapy response in pancreatic cancer patients. Radiomics approaches, extracting quantitative features from imaging modalities such as CT, MRI, and endoscopic ultrasound, have enhanced the accuracy of these deep learning models. Despite the potential of Artificial intelligence in pancreatic imaging, challenges such as legal and ethical considerations, algorithm transparency, and data security remain. This review underscores the transformative potential of Artificial intelligence in enhancing the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic diseases, ultimately aiming to improve patient outcomes and survival rates.",

Significant therapeutic advances and evolving treatment paradigms since 2020 (including risk stratification and treat-to-target approaches) necessitated this comprehensive update to standardize care across the United Arab Emirates. Developed <i>via</i> Delphi consensus methodology, this guidance incorporates a systematic literature review and key international guidelines. It presents 188 summary statements covering the full spectrum of IBD care, including complex scenarios like perianal disease and pregnancy. Key updates feature guidance on newer pharmacologic therapies - interleukin-23, Janus kinase, and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor inhibitors - with refined therapeutic positioning informed by recent head-to-head trials. The consensus emphasizes early, effective treatment to prevent irreversible bowel damage, optimization strategies like therapeutic drug monitoring, and achieving objective treat-to-target goals to improve long-term outcomes. Recognizing local healthcare system challenges, it offers practical recommendations on reducing variability and enhancing equitable access to IBD care. By integrating current clinical evidence with United Arab Emirates-specific considerations, the second edition United Arab Emirates IBD consensus guidance aims to standardize care across sectors, provide a benchmark for payers and policymakers, optimize treatment outcomes, and improve IBD outcomes, aligning national practice with international standards.",

      "abstract": "We study the problem of a decision maker who must provide the best possible treatment recommendation based on an experiment. The desirability of the outcome distribution resulting from the policy recommendation is measured through a functional capturing the distributional characteristic that the decision maker is interested in optimizing. This could be, e.g., its inherent inequality, welfare, level of poverty or its distance to a desired outcome distribution. If the functional of interest is not quasi-convex or if there are constraints, the optimal recommendation may be a mixture of treatments. This vastly expands the set of recommendations that must be considered. We characterize the difficulty of the problem by obtaining maximal expected regret lower bounds. Furthermore, we propose two (near) regret-optimal policies. The first policy is static and thus applicable irrespectively of subjects arriving sequentially or not in the course of the experimentation phase. The second policy can utilize that subjects arrive sequentially by successively eliminating inferior treatments and thus spends the sampling effort where it is most needed.",

      "doi": "",
      "abstract": "Matching is a widely used causal inference design that aims to approximate a randomized experiment using observational data by forming matched sets of treated and control units based on similarities in their covariates. Ideally, treated units are exactly matched with controls on these covariates, enabling randomization-based inference for treatment effects as in a randomized experiment, under the assumption of no unobserved covariates. However, inexact matching often occurs, leading to residual covariate imbalance after matching. Previous matched studies have typically overlooked this issue and relied on conventional randomization-based inference, assuming that some covariate balance criteria are met. Recent research, however, has shown that this approach can introduce significant bias and proposed methods to correct for bias arising from inexact matching in randomization-based inference. These methods, however, are primarily focused on the constant treatment effect and its extensions (i.e., Fisher's sharp null) and do not apply to average treatment effects (i.e., Neyman's weak null). To address this gap, we introduce a new method -- inverse post-matching probability weighting -- for conducting randomization-based inference for average treatment effects under inexact matching. Our theoretical and simulation results indicate that, compared to conventional randomization-based inference methods, our approach significantly reduces bias and improves coverage rates in the presence of inexact matching. Additionally, we demonstrate how this method can be extended to the instrumental variable setting to simultaneously correct for bias due to inexact matching on observed covariates and bias due to unobserved covariates.",

In this framework, sequential testing strategies are widely accepted statistical tools in practice. Since performances of parametric sequential testing procedures vitally depend on the validity of the parametric assumptions regarding underlying data distributions, we focus on distribution-free mechanisms for sequentially evaluating treatment effects. In fixed sample size designs, the density-based empirical likelihood (DBEL) methods provide powerful nonparametric approximations to optimal Neyman-Pearson type statistics. In this article, we extend the DBEL methodology to develop a novel sequential DBEL testing procedure for detecting treatment effects based on paired data. The asymptotic consistency of the proposed test is shown. An extensive Monte Carlo study confirms that the proposed test outperforms the conventional sequential Wilcoxon signed-rank test across a variety of alternatives. The excellent applicability of the proposed method is exemplified using the ventilator-associated pneumonia study that evaluates the effect of Chlorhexidine Gluconate treatment in reducing oral colonization by pathogens in ventilated patients.",

We introduce a novel data-driven method that can estimate treatment-response trajectories in this challenging scenario. We model personalized treatment-response curves as a combination of parametric response functions, hierarchically sharing information across individuals, and a sparse Gaussian process for the baseline trend. Importantly, our model considers measurement error not only in treatment covariates, but also in treatment times, a problem which arises in practice for example when treatment information is based on self-reporting. In a challenging and timely problem of estimating the impact of diet on continuous blood glucose measurements, our model leads to significant improvements in estimation accuracy and prediction.",

      "abstract": "Randomized experiments have been used to assist decision-making in many areas. They help people select the optimal treatment for the test population with certain statistical guarantee. However, subjects can show significant heterogeneity in response to treatments. The problem of customizing treatment assignment based on subject characteristics is known as uplift modeling, differential response analysis, or personalized treatment learning in literature. A key feature for uplift modeling is that the data is unlabeled. It is impossible to know whether the chosen treatment is optimal for an individual subject because response under alternative treatments is unobserved. This presents a challenge to both the training and the evaluation of uplift models. In this paper we describe how to obtain an unbiased estimate of the key performance metric of an uplift model, the expected response. We present a new uplift algorithm which creates a forest of randomized trees. The trees are built with a splitting criterion designed to directly optimize their uplift performance based on the proposed evaluation method. Both the evaluation method and the algorithm apply to arbitrary number of treatments and general response types. Experimental results on synthetic data and industry-provided data show that our algorithm leads to significant performance improvement over other applicable methods.",

      "abstract": "Dynamic treatment regimens (DTRs), also known as treatment algorithms or adaptive interventions, play an increasingly important role in many health domains. DTRs are motivated to address the unique and changing needs of individuals by delivering the type of treatment needed, when needed, while minimizing unnecessary treatment. Practically, a DTR is a sequence of decision rules that specify, for each of several points in time, how available information about the individual's status and progress should be used in practice to decide which treatment (e.g., type or intensity) to deliver. The sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) is an experimental design widely used to empirically inform the development of DTRs. Sample size planning resources for SMARTs have been developed for continuous, binary, and survival outcomes. However, an important gap exists in sample size estimation methodology for SMARTs with longitudinal count outcomes. Further, in many health domains, count data are overdispersed - having variance greater than their mean. We propose a Monte Carlo-based approach to sample size estimation applicable to many types of longitudinal outcomes and provide a case study with longitudinal overdispersed count outcomes.

To our best knowledge, there is no established model averaging approach for distributed data with a focus on improving the estimation of treatment effects. Specifically, under distributed data networks, our framework provides an interpretable tree-based ensemble of CATE estimators that joins models across study sites, while actively modeling the heterogeneity in data sources through site partitioning.

Existing approaches for treatment effect estimation primarily rely on Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs), which tend to feature more homogeneous patient groups, making them less relevant for uncovering subgroups in the population encountered in real-world clinical practice. Subgroup analyses established for RCTs suffer from significant statistical biases when applied to observational studies, which benefit from larger and more representative populations. Our work introduces a novel, outcome-guided, subgroup analysis strategy for identifying subgroups of treatment response in both RCTs and observational studies alike. It hence positions itself in-between individualised and average treatment effect estimation to uncover patient subgroups with distinct treatment responses, critical for actionable insights that may influence treatment guidelines.

Endothelial cells inferred high plasticity toward arterial, venous, capillary, and tip/stalk cells and a neural-like identity at full maturation state. mBVOs responded to inflammatory cues and VEGF blockade in vitro and could be assembled with tumor spheroids in which tumor cells mimicked the same vascular growth pattern as observed in vivo. Our results highlight mBVOs as adaptable in vitro platforms, unlocking various applications and avenues for discovery in vascular biology.",

Substandard and falsified vaccines are becoming more prevalent, caused by both the degradation of authentic vaccines but also deliberately falsified vaccine products. These threaten public health, and the increase in vaccine falsification is now a major concern. There is currently no coordinated global infrastructure or screening methods to monitor vaccine supply chains. In this study, we developed and validated a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) workflow that used open-source machine learning and statistical analysis to distinguish authentic and falsified vaccines. We validated the method on two different MALDI-MS instruments used worldwide for clinical applications. Our results show that multivariate data modelling and diagnostic mass spectra can be used to distinguish authentic and falsified vaccines providing proof-of-concept that MALDI-MS can be used as a screening tool to monitor vaccine supply chains.",

To deepen the understanding of the of Rumex sanguineus composition, an in-depth analysis using non-targeted, mass spectrometry-based metabolomics was performed.  METHODS: Rumex roots, stems and leaves samples were analyzed by UHPLC-HRMS and subsequently subjected to feature-based molecular networking.<h4>Results and conclusion</h4>Overall, 347 primary and specialized metabolites grouped into 8 biochemical classes were annotated. Most of these metabolites (60%) belong to the polyphenols and anthraquinones classes. To investigate potential' toxicity due to the presence of anthraquinones, the amount of emodin was quantified with analytical standard, revealing higher accumulation in leaves compared to stems and roots. This highlights the need for thorough metabolomic studies to understand both beneficial and harmful compounds, especially in plants with historical medicinal use transitioning to modern culinary use.",

      "abstract": "The rapid development and worldwide distribution of COVID-19 vaccines is a remarkable achievement of biomedical research and logistical implementation. However, these developments are associated with the risk of a surge of substandard and falsified (SF) vaccines, as illustrated by the 184 incidents with SF and diverted COVID-19 vaccines which have been reported during the pandemic in 48 countries, with a paucity of methods for their detection in supply chains. In this context, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation-time of flight (MALDI-ToF) mass spectrometry (MS) is globally available for fast and accurate analysis of bacteria in patient samples, offering a potentially accessible solution to identify SF vaccines. We analysed the COVISHIELD™ COVID-19 vaccine; falsified versions of which were found in India, Myanmar and Uganda. We demonstrate for the first time that analysis of spectra from the vaccine vial label and its adhesive could be used as a novel approach to detect falsified vaccines. Vials tested by this approach could be retained in the supply chain since it is non-invasive. We also assessed whether MALDI-ToF MS could be used to distinguish the COVISHIELD™ vaccine from surrogates of falsified vaccines and the effect of temperature on vaccine stability. Both polysorbate 80 and L-histidine excipients of the genuine vaccine could be detected by the presence of a unique combination of MALDI-ToF MS peaks which allowed us to distinguish between the genuine vaccines and falsified vaccine surrogates. Furthermore, even if a falsified product contained polysorbate 80 at the same concentration as used in the genuine vaccine, the characteristic spectral profile of polysorbate 80 used in genuine products is a reliable internal marker for vaccine authenticity. Our findings demonstrate that MALDI-ToF MS analysis of extracts from vial labels and the vaccine excipients themselves can be used independently to detect falsified vaccines. This approach has the potential to be integrated into the national regulatory standards and WHO's Prevent, Detect, and Respond strategy as a novel effective tool for detecting falsified vaccines.",

Several potential genetic, serological, fecal, microbial, histological and immunological biomarkers have been proposed for IBD, and they have been evaluated for clinical routine and clinical trials. Ileocolonoscopy, especially with biopsy collection, has been considered the standard method to diagnose IBD and to assess clinical activity of the disease, but it is limited to the colon and terminal ileum and is considered invasive.

In this typical case of social science research, research teams reported both widely diverging numerical findings and substantive conclusions despite identical start conditions. Researchers' expertise, prior beliefs, and expectations barely predict the wide variation in research outcomes. More than 95% of the total variance in numerical results remains unexplained even after qualitative coding of all identifiable decisions in each team's workflow. This reveals a universe of uncertainty that remains hidden when considering a single study in isolation.

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Rectourethral fistula represents a rare but devastating complication following prostate cancer treatment, with radiation-induced fistulas presenting particular challenges due to compromised tissue vascularity and healing capacity. While various surgical approaches have been described, management of complex post-brachytherapy rectoprostatic fistulas remains challenging with limited reports of successful robotic-assisted techniques. This case report presents a novel robotic-assisted surgical approach incorporating technical modifications including rectal rotation with mesorectal interposition, which has not been widely documented in the literature for managing radiation-induced rectoprostatic fistulas.<h4>Case presentation</h4>A 54-year-old male with localized prostate cancer (clinical stage T2N0M0, Gleason score 3 + 3) developed fecaluria, pneumaturia, and severe pelvic pain one year after brachytherapy treatment. Diagnostic imaging revealed a 1.6 cm anterior rectal wall defect with a fluid-filled cavity between the rectum and prostate. Following initial palliative sigmoidostomy for symptom relief, definitive repair was performed 13 months later using robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy with segmental rectal resection and coloanal anastomosis. Key technical innovations included bladder stabilization with externalized sutures and 180° rectal rotation, positioning the posterior mesorectum as a natural barrier against fistula recurrence. The procedure duration was 365 min with 200 mL blood loss and no immediate complications. At 24-month follow-up, the patient demonstrated complete fistula resolution with normal bowel function (Wexner continence score: 3) following stoma reversal. Prostate-specific antigen remained undetectable with no evidence of cancer recurrence. The patient reported significant quality-of-life improvement, resuming pre-illness physical activities including walking 7-10 km daily.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This case demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of robotic-assisted surgical management for complex radiation-induced rectoprostatic fistulas. The novel technique of rectal rotation with mesorectal interposition may provide additional protection against recurrent fistula formation compared to conventional approaches. This innovative robotic approach could be considered in selected patients with extensive radiation-induced tissue damage where traditional repair techniques may be insufficient, potentially offering improved outcomes in this challenging clinical scenario.",

Continence status and sexual function were assessed using the Cleveland Clinic Incontinence Score (CCIS) and the female sexual function index (FSFI) score. Fistula recurrence was defined as the postoperative passage of gas, feces, or mucosal discharge from the vagina. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software. Within-group comparisons were conducted using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, and between-group analyses were performed using independent samples <i>t</i> tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, and Fisher's exact tests. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 27 cases, 37% were classified as low RVF and 63% as mid RVF. Recurrent RVF was observed in 63% of patients, with a median of 2.00 previous fistula surgeries (interquartile range [IQR]=1.50-4.50). After a median follow-up of 48 months (IQR=24.00-84.00), the total success rate was 88.9%. The CCIS significantly decreased postoperatively compared to preoperative levels (P=0.003). Postoperative FSFI scores were within an acceptable range (22.2±4.22).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The Martius flap procedure was safe, with low morbidity and favorable functional and cosmetic outcomes.

      "abstract": "The image acquisition parameters (IAPs) used to create MRI scans are central to defining the appearance of the images. Deep learning models trained on data acquired using certain parameters might not generalize well to images acquired with different parameters. Being able to recover such parameters directly from an image could help determine whether a deep learning model is applicable, and could assist with data harmonization and/or domain adaptation. Here, we introduce a neural network model that can predict many complex IAPs used to generate an MR image with high accuracy solely using the image, with a single forward pass. These predicted parameters include field strength, echo and repetition times, acquisition matrix, scanner model, scan options, and others. Even challenging parameters such as contrast agent type can be predicted with good accuracy. We perform a variety of experiments and analyses of our model's ability to predict IAPs on many MRI scans of new patients, and demonstrate its usage in a realistic application. Predicting IAPs from the images is an important step toward better understanding the relationship between image appearance and IAPs. This in turn will advance the understanding of many concepts related to the generalizability of neural network models on medical images, including domain shift, domain adaptation, and data harmonization.",

A systematic search was conducted on MEDLINE and Scopus for RCTs published from 1 January 2000 to 31 January 2023. Eligible studies included full-text articles with at least 50 adult CD patients. Primary and secondary outcomes, along with their measurement instruments, were categorized according to the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Filter 2.1 framework. From 88 included studies, 393 outcomes were analyzed. Clinical outcomes, such as clinical remission and response, were the most prevalent (50.6%); biomarkers (11.5%) and patient-reported outcomes (10.2%) were also assessed. Other outcomes included disease behavior and complications (2%), endoscopy (10.4%), histology (0.5%), radiology (1.3%), healthcare utilization (3.8%), and therapy-related safety (6.9%). Composite outcomes showed an increasing trend, reflecting a shift toward comprehensive evaluations. Coprimary endpoints, including clinical symptoms and mucosal inflammation, were reported in 21 of 88 studies.

New IUS indices have been developed with ever better methodologies and are at various stage of validation. A standardized over-the-wire technique for colonic US using a flexible overtube enables endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided tissue sampling beyond the rectum, and forward-viewing radial-array echoendoscopes can assist identification of early neoplastic lesions in proximal colon. Intraoperative ultrasound and contrast-enhanced ultrasound carry an additional diagnostic value compared to conventional preoperative imaging modalities in detecting colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRLM).<h4>Summary</h4>The feasibility of IUS in monitoring IBD activity is supported by growing evidence, but uniform IUS indices are still lacking. Recent advancements in EUS are expanding capabilities for determining depth of invasion of colorectal neoplasms, tissue sampling, and EUS-guided interventions to the entire colon.

      "abstract": "Effective and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can be critical for early treatment and thus has attracted more and more attention nowadays. Since first introduced, machine learning methods have been gaining increasing popularity for AD related research. Among the various identified biomarkers, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are widely used for the prediction of AD or MCI. However, before a machine learning algorithm can be applied, image features need to be extracted to represent the MRI images. While good representations can be pivotal to the classification performance, almost all the previous studies typically rely on human labelling to find the regions of interest (ROI) which may be correlated to AD, such as hippocampus, amygdala, precuneus, etc. This procedure requires domain knowledge and is costly and tedious.   Instead of relying on extraction of ROI features, it is more promising to remove manual ROI labelling from the pipeline and directly work on the raw MRI images. In other words, we can let the machine learning methods to figure out these informative and discriminative image structures for AD classification. In this work, we propose to learn deep convolutional image features using unsupervised and supervised learning. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool in the machine learning community and has been successfully applied to various tasks. We thus propose to exploit deep features of MRI images based on a pre-trained large convolutional neural network (CNN) for AD and MCI classification, which spares the effort of manual ROI annotation process.",

      "abstract": "Perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease (PFCD) is a complication of CD that significantly impacts patients' quality of life, particularly their social and sexual well-being. Despite advances in therapy, its treatment remains a major challenge in the field of inflammatory bowel disease. The pathogenesis of PFCD involves increased production of inflammatory cytokines by infiltrating macrophages and lymphocytes, stimulation of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, activation of myofibroblasts, and elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinases. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent stromal cells with self-renewal and differentiation capabilities. Evidence from animal models and clinical trials indicates that MSC injection into PFCD lesions suppresses the infiltration of inflammatory cells and cytokines, resulting in complete fistula healing. More recently, MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) have shown promising results in promoting fistula healing, particularly in cases of refractory or relapsing fistulas. Notably, the activation of macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) in MSCs has been shown to accelerate the healing process. This narrative review discusses the mechanisms underlying PFCD pathogenesis, the therapeutic roles of MSCs and their EVs, and the potential role of autophagy upregulation in enhancing MSC function and EV production.",

      "abstract": "Perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease (PFCD) is a common presentation of CD, which affects the patients' quality of life, including social and sexual function. The management of PFCD remains a critical challenge in inflammatory bowel disease, primarily due to limited understanding of the mechanisms involved in its pathogenesis, complicating medical treatment. Increased production of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-13 by infiltrating macrophages and other inflammatory cells stimulate the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, resulting in activation of myofibroblasts and elevation of matrix metalloproteinases, leading to fistula formation. Given the potential for malignant transformation, PFCD screening is critical. Cytokine and inflammation-targeted therapies can help control this disease, but recurrence is a common complication. Surgical interventions such as fistulotomy represent viable therapeutic options, with magnetic resonance imaging serving as an important diagnostic tool for delineating fistula tract anatomy. Animal models and clinical trials demonstrate that injection of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into the fistula results in suppression of the inflammatory cells and cytokines and complete resolution of PFCD. Recently, MSC-derived extracellular vesicles were found to stimulate fistula healing, with encouraging results. In this article, we comment on the review article by Pacheco <i>et al</i>, summarizing the various lines of PFCD treatment and highlighting the role of screening for this disease. Importantly, we focus on the various mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of PFCD, the therapeutic roles of MSCs and related extracellular vesicles, and explore the potential role of autophagy in enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of these cells, which may help in the treatment of this disease.",

Our framework assesses both zero-shot and finetuned performance, with attention to segmentation accuracy, generalizability across imaging protocols, and reliability of derived quantitative biomarkers. Finetuned models showed consistent agreement with expert measurements for biomarkers including cartilage thickness, disc height, muscle volume, and compositional T1rho/T2 values. Automated prompting through the AutoLabel system enabled scalable segmentation, with moderate trade-offs in accuracy. As proof of concept, we applied the validated system to (i) a three-stage knee MRI triage cascade and (ii) a longitudinal landmark model that predicts total knee replacement and incident osteoarthritis.

Congenital TEF arises from embryological malformations, often coexisting with esophageal atresia (EA), while acquired TEF primarily stems from malignancies, radiotherapy, or trauma. This condition disrupts normal anatomical functions, leading to significant clinical issues, such as aspiration, respiratory infections, and malnutrition. The current review consolidates findings on the etiology, classification, and pathological mechanisms of TEF, emphasizing how genetic, developmental, and external factors shape its occurrence and progression. Diagnostic advancements, including radiological imaging, endoscopic evaluations, and newer monitoring techniques, have refined clinical assessment. Treatment paradigms for TEF vary from minimally invasive endoscopic interventions, to traditional open and innovative surgical approaches. Conservative management, such as nutritional and anti-infective therapies, remains vital, especially for milder cases. Emerging therapies in regenerative medicine-such as tissue-engineered scaffolds and platelet-rich plasmaoffer transformative potential for refractory cases. Future advancements are oriented toward exploring 3D printing, artificial intelligence, and precision medicine. The necessity of multidisciplinary collaboration is underscored in optimizing holistic patient care.

This review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines; PubMed, Embase and Web of Science databases were used to search for studies published between 2011 and 2024, without language restrictions. Our review was strictly limited to the inclusion of controlled clinical trials to ensure the relevance and quality of the data. After screening, 22 articles were retained, with a total of 953 patients that met the established inclusion criteria. The data obtained from these studies showed that AASCs have promising efficacy in improving scars and ulcers, managing Crohn's disease, and treating glandular dysfunction and kidney disease. In spinal muscular atrophy and osteoarthritis, preliminary results also suggested potential benefits. AASCs-based treatments were well tolerated with no major adverse effects, thus emphasizing their favorable safety profile. AASCs show a significant potential for a variety of clinical applications, but the results must be interpreted with caution due to the methodological limitations of the included studies. Well-designed Phase III clinical trials are needed to confirm these promising results and ensure the safe and effective use of AASCs in clinical practice.

The prevention of PJI holds paramount priority and should be integrated throughout the perioperative period. Although diagnostic criteria for PJI have undergone multiple updates, the 2011 MSIS criteria remain the most widely adopted, requiring comprehensive evaluation of laboratory, pathological, and imaging examinations for diagnosis. PJI treatment necessitates combined antibiotic and surgical interventions. Antibiotic therapy includes empirical treatment after diagnosis, targeted therapy following pathogen identification, and suppressive antibiotic therapy(SAT) for non-surgical candidates. Surgical options comprise debridement, antibiotics, and implant retention(DAIR), one-stage/two-stage revision, and salvage procedures.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Implementation of standardized infection prevention protocols, rational antibiotic use, surgical technical innovations, and advancements in biomaterials have contributed to a reduction in PJI incidence. However, the spread of bacterial resistance and multidrug-resistant organisms in healthcare settings pose new challenges for PJI prevention and treatment. In the future, the research and development of new antimicrobial materials, the innovation of biofilm control technology and the application of precision medicine are expected to further reduce the incidence of PJI, improve the quality of life of patients, and promote a breakthrough in the field of arthroplasty regarding this issue.",

      "abstract": "Outcome prediction is crucial for head and neck cancer patients as it can provide prognostic information for early treatment planning. Radiomics methods have been widely used for outcome prediction from medical images. However, these methods are limited by their reliance on intractable manual segmentation of tumor regions. Recently, deep learning methods have been proposed to perform end-to-end outcome prediction so as to remove the reliance on manual segmentation. Unfortunately, without segmentation masks, these methods will take the whole image as input, such that makes them difficult to focus on tumor regions and potentially unable to fully leverage the prognostic information within the tumor regions. In this study, we propose a radiomics-enhanced deep multi-task framework for outcome prediction from PET/CT images, in the context of HEad and neCK TumOR segmentation and outcome prediction challenge (HECKTOR 2022). In our framework, our novelty is to incorporate radiomics as an enhancement to our recently proposed Deep Multi-task Survival model (DeepMTS). The DeepMTS jointly learns to predict the survival risk scores of patients and the segmentation masks of tumor regions. Radiomics features are extracted from the predicted tumor regions and combined with the predicted survival risk scores for final outcome prediction, through which the prognostic information in tumor regions can be further leveraged. Our method achieved a C-index of 0.681 on the testing set, placing the 2nd on the leaderboard with only 0.00068 lower in C-index than the 1st place.",

Our meta-analysis aimed to explore the clinical response to FD, rates of successful restoration of bowel continuity after FD, rates of re-diversion, and factors affecting the success of FD in pfCD.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out of adult patients who had undergone FD for pfCD, with detailed patient outcome data. Studies were identified through a literature search of six bibliographic databases and one trial register, all run on February 28, 2025, including MEDLINE ALL, EMBASE, Emcare, APA PsycInfo, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and Clinicaltrials.gov.<h4>Results</h4>Seventeen studies encompassing 714 adult pfCD patients were included. FD resulted in a 65% clinical improvement rate, yet considerable heterogeneity existed in study methodologies and outcome definitions. While 29% of patients achieved bowel restoration within a median follow-up of 58.2 months, challenges in sustaining the effects were evident, with 10% requiring repeat diversion and a 37% overall proctectomy/proctocolectomy rate. Factors associated with diversion success included the absence of rectal involvement and quiescent luminal disease, with biologic use showing no impact on outcomes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>FD offers symptom control in pfCD, although restoration rates remain low. These findings emphasize the need for individualized patient counseling. Future research should strive for uniform measures and refined approaches to enhance pfCD management.",

      "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) require effective therapies to prevent morbidity and maintain quality of life. The introduction of biologic agents, beginning with monoclonal antibodies targeting tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, has launched a new era of advancements that have markedly improved short- and long-term outcomes of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Along with these improvements, there have been challenges to address in optimizing use of biologic therapies in children with IBD. Young children may have rapid drug clearance, and growing children have changing medication needs related to changes in body size, metabolism, and development. For these and other reasons, one size (one dose) does not fit all. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), which involves measurement of drug concentration in serum usually, typically at the predose trough, has emerged as a valuable tool for optimizing dosing and preventing pharmacokinetic failure. This society paper reviews the use of TDM, including target ranges during induction and maintenance therapy for anti-TNF agents and for emerging biologics. This report has been compiled by pediatric gastroenterologists on behalf of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition IBD committee after extensive review of the current literature. The purpose of this clinical position statement is to provide guidance to clinicians in the use of TDM to optimize the treatment of children with IBD.",

      "abstract": "Specialised pre-trained language models are becoming more frequent in NLP since they can potentially outperform models trained on generic texts. BioBERT and BioClinicalBERT are two examples of such models that have shown promise in medical NLP tasks. Many of these models are overparametrised and resource-intensive, but thanks to techniques like Knowledge Distillation (KD), it is possible to create smaller versions that perform almost as well as their larger counterparts. In this work, we specifically focus on development of compact language models for processing clinical texts (i.e. progress notes, discharge summaries etc). We developed a number of efficient lightweight clinical transformers using knowledge distillation and continual learning, with the number of parameters ranging from 15 million to 65 million. These models performed comparably to larger models such as BioBERT and ClinicalBioBERT and significantly outperformed other compact models trained on general or biomedical data. Our extensive evaluation was done across several standard datasets and covered a wide range of clinical text-mining tasks, including Natural Language Inference, Relation Extraction, Named Entity Recognition, and Sequence Classification. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study specifically focused on creating efficient and compact transformers for clinical NLP tasks.

      "abstract": "Clinical machine learning is increasingly multimodal, collected in both structured tabular formats and unstructured forms such as freetext. We propose a novel task of exploring fairness on a multimodal clinical dataset, adopting equalized odds for the downstream medical prediction tasks. To this end, we investigate a modality-agnostic fairness algorithm - equalized odds post processing - and compare it to a text-specific fairness algorithm: debiased clinical word embeddings. Despite the fact that debiased word embeddings do not explicitly address equalized odds of protected groups, we show that a text-specific approach to fairness may simultaneously achieve a good balance of performance and classical notions of fairness.

Furthermore, we specifically employ efficient fine-tuning methods from NLP, namely, bottleneck adapters and prompt tuning, to adapt the models to our specialised task. Our evaluations suggest that fine-tuning a frozen BERT model pre-trained on natural language and with bottleneck adapters outperforms all other strategies, including full fine-tuning of the specialised BioBERT model.

RAR has received abundant theoretical attention from the biostatistical literature since the 1930's and has been the subject of numerous debates. In the last decade, it has received renewed consideration from the applied and methodological communities, driven by well-known practical examples and its widespread use in machine learning.

      "abstract": "Purpose: This goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of a data-driven clinical productivity system that leverages Electronic Health Record (EHR) data to provide productivity decision support functionality in a real-world clinical setting. The system was implemented for a large behavioral health care provider seeing over 75,000 distinct clients a year. Design/methodology/approach: The key metric in this system is a \"VPU\", which simultaneously optimizes multiple aspects of clinical care. The resulting mathematical value of clinical productivity was hypothesized to tightly link the organization's performance to its expectations and, through transparency and decision support tools at the clinician level, affect significant changes in productivity, quality, and consistency relative to traditional models of clinical productivity. Findings: In only 3 months, every single variable integrated into the VPU system showed significant improvement, including a 30% rise in revenue, 10% rise in clinical percentage, a 25% rise in treatment plan completion, a 20% rise in case rate eligibility, along with similar improvements in compliance/audit issues, outcomes collection, access, etc. Practical implications: A data-driven clinical productivity system employing decision support functionality is effective because of the impact on clinician behavior relative to traditional clinical productivity systems. Critically, the model is also extensible to integration with outcomes-based productivity. Originality/Value: EHR's are only a first step - the problem is turning that data into useful information. Technology can leverage the data in order to produce actionable information that can inform clinical practice and decision-making. Without additional technology, EHR's are essentially just copies of paper-based records stored in electronic form.",

      "doi": "",
      "abstract": "Objective: Integrating EHR data with other resources is essential in rare disease research due to low disease prevalence. Such integration is dependent on the alignment of ontologies used for data annotation. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is used to annotate clinical diagnoses; the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) to annotate phenotypes. Although these ontologies overlap in biomedical entities described, the extent to which they are interoperable is unknown. We investigate how well aligned these ontologies are and whether such alignments facilitate EHR data integration.   Materials and Methods: We conducted an empirical analysis of the coverage of mappings between ICD and HPO. We interpret this mapping coverage as a proxy for how easily clinical data can be integrated with research ontologies such as HPO. We quantify how exhaustively ICD codes are mapped to HPO by analyzing mappings in the UMLS Metathesaurus. We analyze the proportion of ICD codes mapped to HPO within a real-world EHR dataset.   Results and Discussion: Our analysis revealed that only 2.2% of ICD codes have direct mappings to HPO in UMLS. Within our EHR dataset, less than 50% of ICD codes have mappings to HPO terms. ICD codes that are used frequently in EHR data tend to have mappings to HPO; ICD codes that represent rarer medical conditions are seldom mapped.   Conclusion: We find that interoperability between ICD and HPO via UMLS is limited. While other mapping sources could be incorporated, there are no established conventions for what resources should be used to complement UMLS.",

      "abstract": "Recently natural language processing (NLP) tools have been developed to identify and extract salient risk indicators in electronic health records (EHRs). Sentiment analysis, although widely used in non-medical areas for improving decision making, has been studied minimally in the clinical setting. In this study, we undertook, to our knowledge, the first domain adaptation of sentiment analysis to psychiatric EHRs by defining psychiatric clinical sentiment, performing an annotation project, and evaluating multiple sentence-level sentiment machine learning (ML) models. Results indicate that off-the-shelf sentiment analysis tools fail in identifying clinically positive or negative polarity, and that the definition of clinical sentiment that we provide is learnable with relatively small amounts of training data. This project is an initial step towards further refining sentiment analysis methods for clinical use. Our long-term objective is to incorporate the results of this project as part of a machine learning model that predicts inpatient readmission risk. We hope that this work will initiate a discussion concerning domain adaptation of sentiment analysis to the clinical setting.",

In this work, we focus on the vast amounts of unstructured natural language data stored in clinical notes and propose to automatically generate synthetic clinical notes that are more amenable to sharing using generative models trained on real de-identified records. To evaluate the merit of such notes, we measure both their privacy preservation properties as well as utility in training clinical NLP models. Experiments using neural language models yield notes whose utility is close to that of the real ones in some clinical NLP tasks, yet leave ample room for future improvements.",

In this work, we address this need by exploring and releasing BERT models for clinical text: one for generic clinical text and another for discharge summaries specifically. We demonstrate that using a domain-specific model yields performance improvements on three common clinical NLP tasks as compared to nonspecific embeddings. These domain-specific models are not as performant on two clinical de-identification tasks, and argue that this is a natural consequence of the differences between de-identified source text and synthetically non de-identified task text.",

Clinical, radiological and pharmacokinetic data were collected.<h4>Results</h4>Data from 39 patients were analyzed. The median duration of treatment was 16.1 months. Seventeen patients (43.6%) had initiated SC formulation upfront. The complete clinical remission rate was 74.4%, significantly higher in patients switched from IV to SC formulation. Among patients switched from IV to SC formulation, 86.5% maintained remission. In the overall study population, 89.7% were able to continue treatment, with intensified protocols in 61.5% of patients. The deep radiological remission rate was 61.5%. The median infliximab concentration was 22.7 µg/mL. Only the intensified administration protocol was significantly associated with higher infliximab concentrations. Immunosuppressants had no impact. The median infliximab concentration was higher in patients in remission (35.9 µg/mL vs 22.4 µg/mL), but without any significant difference.<h4>Conclusion</h4>CT-P13 SC appears to be at least as effective as the IV formulation for fistulizing anoperineal lesions, and switching from IV to SC allows remission to be maintained in the vast majority of cases. Despite numerically higher infliximab concentrations in patients in remission, no significant difference could be identified.

Pathological findings from the first two surgeries showed no malignant lesions, while the third confirmed moderately to poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The patient had a history of lymphoma and small bowel resection; HIV infection was excluded upon admission. Carcinoembryonic antigen and cytokeratin 19 fragment levels were mildly elevated, and imaging revealed a high complex anal fistula. The diagnosis was ultimately confirmed by pathological biopsy. We propose that malignant transformation may be linked to chronic inflammatory stimulation, reduced immune function, and prior abdominal surgery. Diagnosis depends on pathological confirmation, and the use of multiple imaging modalities can improve diagnostic accuracy.

Management must be individualized, particularly in recurrent cases. We report the case of a 55-year-old male with a recurrent high posterior transsphincteric anal fistula who had undergone multiple previous surgical interventions. Initial treatment with fistulectomies and cryptectomies resulted in disruption of both the internal and external anal sphincters, leading to severe fecal incontinence. Due to persistent fistulous drainage, the patient underwent diagnostic laparoscopy with creation of a protective loop ileostomy, irrigation and drainage of the tract, primary transanal closure of the internal opening, and application of fibrin sealant (Tisseel<sup>®</sup>, Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, IL). In the outpatient setting, tract curettage using a CitoBrush<sup>®</sup> (Medscand AB, Malmö, Sweden) and repeat application of fibrin sealant were performed. Subsequent examination under anesthesia revealed fibrosis without evidence of an active tract. Intestinal continuity was ultimately restored. The patient's postoperative course was favorable, with no recurrence or continence impairment. This case illustrates the importance of a stepwise surgical approach integrating conventional and adjunctive techniques for the treatment of complex anal fistulas. The combined use of sphincteroplasty, temporary fecal diversion, and biological sealants provided effective disease control while preserving sphincter function. Current evidence supports the use of fibrin sealants as adjuncts in fibrotic tracts and the role of temporary diversion in cases involving sphincter disruption. Sequential and patient-specific surgical management led to successful resolution of the fistula without compromising continence. This multidisciplinary strategy may be considered in patients with complex anatomy and a history of multiple surgical failures.",

A 36-year-old male patient with a history of nine previous fistula surgeries presented with persistent symptoms and a newly developed lateral external opening in the right gluteal region. VAAFT was performed under general anesthesia with the patient in the prone position. The fistuloscope was advanced through the external opening, allowing visualization of both the primary and secondary tracts. The internal opening was identified, and the fistulous tracts were thoroughly debrided. A draining seton was placed while preserving the integrity of the sphincter complex. At the four-month follow-up, all secondary tracts had successfully closed. However, due to the presence of false tracts resulting from prior interventions, the primary tract had evolved into a suprasphincteric fistula. The patient remains under regular follow-up with a seton in place and has reported significant improvement in both symptoms and overall quality of life. Our experience indicates that VAAFT is a valuable option in selected cases of complex and recurrent anal fistulas, especially when the internal opening cannot be identified using conventional methods.",

      "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic, progressive inflammatory condition, involving primarily the bowel, characterized by a typical remitting-relapsing pattern. Despite endoscopy representing the reference standard for the diagnosis and assessment of disease activity, radiological imaging has a key role, providing information about mural and extra-visceral involvement. <b>Methods:</b> Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging are the most frequently used radiological techniques in clinical practice for both the diagnosis and staging of CD involving the small bowel in non-urgent settings. The contribution of imaging in the management of CD is reported on by answering the following practical questions: (1) What is the best technique for the assessment of small bowel CD? (2) Is imaging a good option to assess colonic disease? (3) Which disease pattern is present: inflammatory, fibrotic or fistulizing? (4) Is it possible to identify the presence of strictures and to discriminate inflammatory from fibrotic ones? (5) How does imaging help in defining disease extension and localization? (6) Can imaging assess disease activity? (7) Is it possible to evaluate post-operative recurrence? <b>Results:</b> Imaging is suitable for assessing disease activity, extension and characterizing disease patterns. CT and MRI can both answer the abovementioned questions, but MRI has a greater sensitivity and specificity for assessing disease activity and does not use ionizing radiation. <b>Conclusions:</b> Radiologists are essential healthcare professionals to be involved in multidisciplinary teams for the management of CD patients to obtain the necessary answers for clinically relevant questions.",

      "abstract": "Endometriosis is a clinical entity affecting up to 10% of women of reproductive age, characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. While extrapelvic endometriosis has been documented, pancreatic endometriosis remains extremely rare and poses significant diagnostic challenges due to its similarity to other pancreatic diseases. At the same time, splenic mesothelial cysts are also rare and typically benign. This report presents a unique case of pancreatic endometriosis coexisting with a splenic mesothelial cyst in a 31-year-old woman. The patient presented to the emergency department with complaints of persistent epigastric and low back pain. She noted having similar symptoms approximately a year prior. Her past medical history was otherwise unremarkable, and there was no known family history of pancreatic disease or neoplasms. Initial imaging revealed a 3.8 cm cystic lesion in the pancreatic tail, with features suggestive of mucinous cystadenoma. Following clinical evaluation and confirmation of the cyst's nature through endoscopic ultrasound-guided biopsy, the patient subsequently underwent laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy due to worsening symptoms. Gross examination revealed a multilocular pancreatic cyst with a smooth, hemorrhagic wall. Microscopic analysis showed the cyst to be lined by cuboidal to columnar epithelium, consistent with pancreatic endometriosis, confirmed by immunohistochemical staining. The spleen showed cystic formations, diagnosed as a multifaceted mesothelial cyst. In conclusion, this report is the first to document the coexistence of pancreatic endometriosis and splenic mesothelial cysts, highlighting the importance of accurate imaging and pathologic evaluation in the diagnosis of these rare conditions. Early diagnosis and surgical intervention lead to favorable outcomes, reinforcing the importance of comprehensive diagnostic strategies.",

Although there are many non-infectious mimics, such as Behcet's, drug-induced enterocolitis, and lymphoma, the main dilemma is differentiating IBD from infection; namely, Crohn's disease (CD) from intestinal tuberculosis (ITB). However, a careful history/examination, targeted investigations, along with histopathology should make it possible to make a definitive diagnosis of IBD in the majority of cases.

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic intestinal inflammatory disorder, the etiology of which remains unknown, and is characterized by symptoms such as chronic abdominal pain, diarrhea, obstruction, and perianal lesions. Histopathology is widely regarded as the preferred method for diagnosing CD, although the histological diagnosis may lack specificity. The identification of granulomas is commonly believed to be the most reliable diagnostic indicator for CD, surpassing all other clinical features in significance. Nevertheless, research indicates that the detection rate of granulomas in CD exhibits considerable variability. Furthermore, granulomas can manifest in various specific infections including tuberculosis and Yersinia, as well as in a range of diseases characterized by macrophage reactions such as sarcoidosis and drug-induced enteritis. Granulomas associated with CD typically do not exhibit necrosis. However, the formation of caseous granulomas may occur as a result of secondary infections related to anti-CD drug treatment or perforation of the intestinal wall.<h4>Case presentation</h4>In this study, we present a case of a 28-year-old female patient diagnosed with CD exhibiting histologic granulomas, including both caseating and non-caseating forms, which demonstrated a positive response to medical treatment.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In clinical practice, various forms of granulomas may indicate diverse underlying diseases, yet lack specificity. It is suggested that the presence of caseous granulomas should not be considered as a definitive exclusion criterion for the diagnosis when clinical, endoscopic, imaging and other histopathological features are consistent with CD. This study is the first report of caseous granulomas in CD without concomitant tuberculosis infection.",

Despite high clinical prevalence, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying RIII remain poorly defined, hindering therapeutic development. Current diagnostic modalities (imaging, endoscopy) lack sensitivity and specificity for early detection or real-time monitoring. While biomarkers offer promise for non-invasive assessment and prognosis, existing candidates face limitations in reproducibility and clinical applicability. Therapeutic options, ranging from pharmaceuticals to surgery, show variable efficacy, underscoring the need for optimized strategies. This review systematically explores RIII pathogenesis, emphasizing radiation-induced immune dysregulation, epigenetic alterations, and gut microbiota dysbiosis. We discuss potential biomarkers, such as miRNA, fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs), etc. We categorize therapies into radioprotectors (pre-radiation use) and radiomitigators (post-radiation intervention), highlighting natural plant-derived compounds and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for their multi-target effects, alongside emerging approaches like stem cell and microbiota transplantation, with discussions on their therapeutic potential and clinical challenges. Crucially, we exclusively summarize recent clinical translation advances to accelerate drug development. Through critical evaluation of evidence, we propose future directions to refine risk stratification, enable timely intervention, and improve long-term outcomes for irradiated patients.

The study is a review of the literature that highlights the utility and limitations of imaging such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It follows the diagnostic approach from history and physical examination to laboratory tests and imaging. Some conditions like vestibular neuritis and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) have limited imaging utility due to the fine details required.

      "abstract": "Orbital venous-lymphatic malformations (VLMs) are complex vascular anomalies that pose significant challenges to ophthalmologists due to their diverse clinical manifestations and the difficulties inherent in their therapeutic management, particularly given their proximity to critical orbital structures. This narrative review synthesizes the current knowledge on the classification, pathology, molecular mechanisms, imaging characteristics, and therapeutic strategies for VLMs. Historically misclassified as orbital lymphangiomas, VLMs are now recognized as complex malformations comprising interconnected venous and lymphatic components, with the potential for significant complications, including proptosis, visual impairment, and esthetic disturbances. Recent molecular insights have revealed critical pathogenetic mechanisms, particularly mutations in the <i>PIK3CA</i> gene that activate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin transduction network, alongside the upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated signaling. These aberrations not only illuminate the disease etiology but also present promising therapeutic targets. Contemporary management strategies emphasize a multidisciplinary approach, with sclerotherapy emerging as a particularly promising intervention. Sclerosing agents such as bleomycin and pingyangmycin typically yield effective treatment outcomes with relatively favorable safety profiles. Surgical excision is reserved for accessible lesions but often requires adjunctive therapies due to the infiltrative nature of VLMs. Emerging treatments targeting molecular pathways, including PI3K inhibitors and anti-VEGF therapies, show promise in refractory cases. As our understanding deepens, clinicians can now offer more personalized interventions that consider factors such as lesion location, extent, architecture, and hemodynamic characteristics, thereby minimizing morbidity and optimizing clinical and aesthetic outcomes.",

This paper explores the immunological underpinnings of CD, with a focus on the elevated levels of serum immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) and their correlation with disease severity and therapeutic response. We review clinical trials and case studies that demonstrate the potential of IgG4-guided exclusion diets and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy in ameliorating CD symptoms and inflammation. Additionally, we delve into advancements in machine learning (ML) models that utilize fecal microbiome data, offering promising diagnostic tools for distinguishing CD from ulcerative colitis and non-IBD conditions. The integration of ML in endoscopy and predictive models for therapy complications signifies a leap toward precision medicine in IBD management.

      "abstract": "Lung cancer is a prevalent malignant disease with the highest mortality rate among oncological conditions. The assessment of its clinical TNM staging primarily relies on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the thorax and proximal abdomen, sometimes with the addition of positron emission tomography/CT scans, mainly for better evaluation of mediastinal lymph node involvement and detection of distant metastases. The purpose of TNM staging is to establish a universal nomenclature for the anatomical extent of lung cancer, facilitating interdisciplinary communication for treatment decisions and research advancements. Recent studies utilizing a large international database and multidisciplinary insights indicate a need to update the TNM classification to enhance the anatomical categorization of lung cancer, ultimately optimizing treatment strategies. The eighth edition of the TNM classification, issued by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC), transitioned to the ninth edition on 1 January 2025. Key changes include a more detailed classification of the N and M descriptor categories, whereas the T descriptor remains unchanged. Notably, the N2 category will be split into N2a and N2b based on the single-station or multi-station involvement of ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes, respectively. The M1c category will differentiate between single (M1c1) and multiple (M1c2) organ system involvement for extrathoracic metastases.

      "abstract": "Sodium magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is sensitive and specific to ionic balance of cells owing to 10 fold difference in sodium concentration across membrane actively maintained by sodium potassium (Na+ K+) pump. Disruption of the pump and membrane integrity, as seen in neurological disorders such as epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, bipolar disease, and mild traumatic brain injury, leads to a large increase in intracellular sodium. Such a cellular level alteration is however overshadowed by large signal from extracellular sodium, leaving behind a long standing pursuit to separate signals from sodium exhibiting mono vs biexponential transverse (T2) decay under the inherent constraint of low signal to noise ratio even at advanced clinical field of 3 Tesla. Here we propose a novel technique that exploits intrinsic difference in their T2 decays by simply acquiring single quantum images at multiple echo times (TEs) and performing accurate matrix inversion at voxel. This approach was then investigated using numerical models, agar phantoms and human subjects, showing high accuracy of the separation in phantoms (95.8 percent for monoT2 and 72.5 to 80.4 percent for biT2) and clinical feasibility in humans. Thus, sodium MRI at 3T can now facilitate detection of neurological disorders early at cellular level and response to treatment as well.

The numerical model is developed and simulated using a commercial multiphysics simulation package where a semi-implicit FSI coupling scheme combines a finite volume method blood flow model and a finite element method vessel wall model. A pulsatile mass-flow boundary condition is prescribed at the artery inlet of the model, and a three-element Windkessel model at the artery and vein outlets. The FSI model is freely available for analysis and extension. This work shows the effectiveness of combining a number of stabilisation techniques to simultaneously overcome the added-mass effect and optimise the efficiency of the overall model. The PC-MRA data, fluid model, and FSI model results show almost identical flow features in the fistula; this applies in particular to a flow recirculation region in the vein that could potentially lead to fistula failure.",

It proposes a noise-resistant method for classifying responding rows of normally and pathologically functioning fistulas. This approach is grounded in the hypothesis that laminar blood flow signifies normal function, while turbulent flow indicates pathology. The study explores two distinct methods for distinguishing chaotic from regular time series. The first method involves mapping the time series onto the entropy-complexity plane and subsequently comparing it to established clusters. The second method, introduced by the authors, constructs a concepts-objects graph using formal concept analysis.

This report focuses on a patient in the first year of life, who experienced a chronic, consumptive coagulopathy in the setting of a highly vascular enteroatmospheric fistula. Sharing many features with the aforementioned syndrome, this anomaly suggests a novel association of the Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon with a unique vascular malformation.

Long disease duration and severe motor deficits before treatment initiation are generally associated with poor functional outcomes. We report two cases of sdAVF in patients presenting with prolonged symptom duration and severe lower limb paralysis. Despite these unfavourable prognostic indicators, both patients underwent early postoperative rehabilitation aimed at activating the central pattern generator through intensive weight-bearing exercises following surgical treatment. In Case 1, where concomitant spinal degenerative disease was not present, the patient achieved rapid functional improvement and independent ambulation within one week. In contrast, in Case 2, which was complicated by spinal stenosis, ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, and poor obliteration of the abnormal vasculature, the patient demonstrated delayed but steady functional gains, ultimately achieving ambulation with minimal assistance at 13 months postoperatively. These cases suggest that even in patients with sdAVF presenting with long-standing symptoms and severe paralysis, functional recovery is possible with tailored rehabilitation. Complications such as spinal degenerative disorders and incomplete obliteration of the abnormal vasculature may affect the rate and degree of recovery. Early and sustained rehabilitation is essential for managing such high-risk patients.",

The patient was hospitalized due to the rupture of a mass in the right lower abdomen in August 2019. A computed tomography scan demonstrated the spreading of primary cervical cancer to the right lower abdomen, which broke through the skin. In this terminal stage of cervical cancer accompanied with malnutrition, the patient suddenly presented with cognitive impairment, particularly in recent and immediate memory, as well as bilateral sustained nystagmus during hospitalization. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed hyperintensity in the periaqueductal midbrain on T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of WE was made, and thiamine (100 mg) was immediately administered intramuscularly three times a day.

      "abstract": "Medical image segmentation has been significantly advanced with the rapid development of deep learning (DL) techniques. Existing DL-based segmentation models are typically discriminative; i.e., they aim to learn a mapping from the input image to segmentation masks. However, these discriminative methods neglect the underlying data distribution and intrinsic class characteristics, suffering from unstable feature space. In this work, we propose to complement discriminative segmentation methods with the knowledge of underlying data distribution from generative models. To that end, we propose a novel hybrid diffusion framework for medical image segmentation, termed HiDiff, which can synergize the strengths of existing discriminative segmentation models and new generative diffusion models. HiDiff comprises two key components: discriminative segmentor and diffusion refiner. First, we utilize any conventional trained segmentation models as discriminative segmentor, which can provide a segmentation mask prior for diffusion refiner. Second, we propose a novel binary Bernoulli diffusion model (BBDM) as the diffusion refiner, which can effectively, efficiently, and interactively refine the segmentation mask by modeling the underlying data distribution. Third, we train the segmentor and BBDM in an alternate-collaborative manner to mutually boost each other. Extensive experimental results on abdomen organ, brain tumor, polyps, and retinal vessels segmentation datasets, covering four widely-used modalities, demonstrate the superior performance of HiDiff over existing medical segmentation algorithms, including the state-of-the-art transformer- and diffusion-based ones. In addition, HiDiff excels at segmenting small objects and generalizing to new datasets. Source codes are made available at https://github.com/takimailto/HiDiff.",

      "abstract": "Human organs constantly undergo anatomical changes due to a complex mix of short-term (e.g., heartbeat) and long-term (e.g., aging) factors. Evidently, prior knowledge of these factors will be beneficial when modeling their future state, i.e., via image generation. However, most of the medical image generation tasks only rely on the input from a single image, thus ignoring the sequential dependency even when longitudinal data is available. Sequence-aware deep generative models, where model input is a sequence of ordered and timestamped images, are still underexplored in the medical imaging domain that is featured by several unique challenges: 1) Sequences with various lengths; 2) Missing data or frame, and 3) High dimensionality. To this end, we propose a sequence-aware diffusion model (SADM) for the generation of longitudinal medical images. Recently, diffusion models have shown promising results in high-fidelity image generation. Our method extends this new technique by introducing a sequence-aware transformer as the conditional module in a diffusion model. The novel design enables learning longitudinal dependency even with missing data during training and allows autoregressive generation of a sequence of images during inference. Our extensive experiments on 3D longitudinal medical images demonstrate the effectiveness of SADM compared with baselines and alternative methods.

However, the feasibility of multi-time point [$^{18}$F]-FDG PET scans for diagnosis is limited due to radiation exposure, cost, and patient burden. To address this, we have developed a predictive image-to-image translation (I2I) model to forecast future [$^{18}$F]-FDG PET scans using baseline and year-one data. The proposed model employs a convolutional neural network architecture with long-short term memory and was trained on [$^{18}$F]-FDG PET data from 161 individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Our I2I network showed high accuracy in predicting year-two [18F]-FDG PET scans, with a mean absolute error of 0.031 and a structural similarity index of 0.961. Furthermore, the model successfully predicted PET scans up to seven years post-baseline. Notably, the predicted [$^{18}$F]-FDG PET signal in an AD-susceptible meta-region was highly accurate for individuals with mild cognitive impairment across years. In contrast, a linear model was sufficient for predicting brain metabolism in cognitively normal and dementia subjects. In conclusion, both the I2I network and the linear model could offer valuable prognostic insights, guiding early intervention strategies to preemptively address anticipated declines in brain metabolism and potentially to monitor treatment effects.",

      "abstract": "Jump frequencies of 111In/Cd tracer atoms were measured for a series of layered phases LanCoIn3n+2 using the technique of perturbed angular correlation of gamma rays (PAC). The frequencies were determined by analysis of nuclear quadrupole relaxation produced by fluctuating electric field gradients. Samples were synthesized having nominal values n= 1, 2, 3, 5 and \\infty, with n=\\infty corresponding to the L12 phase LaIn3. The phases form heuristically from LaIn3 by replacing every (n+1)th (100) mixed plane of La and In atoms with a plane of Co-atoms. For the n=1 phase, LaCoIn5, jump frequencies were too small to detect. Two signals were observed, one for indium atoms next to the Co-planes and the other for more distant indium atoms. No relaxation was observed for atoms next to the Co-planes, indicating that there is no diffusion across the Co-planes. With increasing n, jump rates for the other In-atoms increased toward values observed for LaIn3. Jump frequency activation enthalpies for n= 3 and 5 were observed to be the same as for n=\\infty, suggesting the same diffusion mechanism. However, the jump-frequency prefactors were found to be smaller for small n, which is attributed to reductions in the connectivity of the diffusion sublattice. We conclude that diffusion in the layered phases is remarkably similar to diffusion in LaIn3 once the reduced connectivity is taken into account.",

      "abstract": "Purpose: Deformable Image Registration (DIR) can benefit from additional guidance using corresponding landmarks in the images. However, the benefits thereof are largely understudied, especially due to the lack of automatic landmark detection methods for three-dimensional (3D) medical images.   Approach: We present a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN), called DCNN-Match, that learns to predict landmark correspondences in 3D images in a self-supervised manner. We trained DCNN-Match on pairs of Computed Tomography (CT) scans containing simulated deformations. We explored five variants of DCNN-Match that use different loss functions and assessed their effect on the spatial density of predicted landmarks and the associated matching errors. We also tested DCNN-Match variants in combination with the open-source registration software Elastix to assess the impact of predicted landmarks in providing additional guidance to DIR.   Results: We tested our approach on lower-abdominal CT scans from cervical cancer patients: 121 pairs containing simulated deformations and 11 pairs demonstrating clinical deformations. The results showed significant improvement in DIR performance when landmark correspondences predicted by DCNN-Match were used in the case of simulated (p = $0e^0$) as well as clinical deformations (p = 0.030). We also observed that the spatial density of the automatic landmarks with respect to the underlying deformation affect the extent of improvement in DIR. Finally, DCNN-Match was found to generalize to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans without requiring retraining, indicating easy applicability to other datasets.   Conclusions: DCNN-Match learns to predict landmark correspondences in 3D medical images in a self-supervised manner, which can improve DIR performance.",

      "abstract": "Diffusion models have shown remarkable success in visual synthesis, but have also raised concerns about potential abuse for malicious purposes. In this paper, we seek to build a detector for telling apart real images from diffusion-generated images. We find that existing detectors struggle to detect images generated by diffusion models, even if we include generated images from a specific diffusion model in their training data. To address this issue, we propose a novel image representation called DIffusion Reconstruction Error (DIRE), which measures the error between an input image and its reconstruction counterpart by a pre-trained diffusion model. We observe that diffusion-generated images can be approximately reconstructed by a diffusion model while real images cannot. It provides a hint that DIRE can serve as a bridge to distinguish generated and real images. DIRE provides an effective way to detect images generated by most diffusion models, and it is general for detecting generated images from unseen diffusion models and robust to various perturbations. Furthermore, we establish a comprehensive diffusion-generated benchmark including images generated by eight diffusion models to evaluate the performance of diffusion-generated image detectors. Extensive experiments on our collected benchmark demonstrate that DIRE exhibits superiority over previous generated-image detectors.

Repeated brain MRI at 10 days after cessation showed lesions partially resolved. Literature review identified 18 pediatric MIE cases, totaling 19 cases including our case. Except for one infant case presenting with intermittent hypothermia, bradycardia, growth retardation, reduced activity, muscle weakness and hypotonia, the predominant neurological symptoms in the other 18 cases were ataxia (11/18), altered mental status (8/18), dysarthria (7/18), and epileptic seizures (5/18). Symmetric brain MRI lesions involving dentate nuclei (13/17), splenium of corpus callosum (9/17), midbrain (6/17), pons (5/17). Most patients (17/19) achieved complete clinical resolution and brain MRI improvement after metronidazole withdrawal.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Pediatric MIE is rare and manifests with widespread neurological involvement, characterized by cerebellar dysfunction, altered mental status, and seizures. Brain MRI typically reveals symmetrical lesions in the dentate nuclei, splenium of corpus callosum, and midbrain. Timely drug discontinuation is critical for treatment, and most cases are reversible, though a few may leave neurological sequelae.",

      "abstract": "Here we present a model of self healing in which correlations between chromophores, as mediated by the polymer, are key to the recovery process. Our model determines the size distribution of the correlation volume using a grand canonical ensemble through a free energy advantage parameter. Choosing a healing rate that is proportional to the number of undamaged molecules in a correlated region, and a decay rate proportional to the intensity normalized to the correlation volume, the ensemble average is shown to correctly predict decay and recovery of the population of disperse orange 11-DO11 (1-amino-2-methylanthraquinone) molecules doped in PMMA polymer as a function of time and concentration as measured with amplified spontaneous emission and linear absorption spectroscopy using only three parameters that apply to the full set of data. Our model also predicts the temperature dependence of the process. One set of parameters should be characteristic of a particular polymer and dopant chromophore combination. Thus, use of the model in determining these parameters for various materials systems should provide the data needed to test fundamental models of the underlying mechanism responsible for self healing.",

      "abstract": "Coupling cyber and physical systems gives rise to numerous engineering challenges and opportunities. An important challenge is the contagion of failure from one system to another, that can lead to large scale cascading failures. On the other hand, self-healing ability emerges as a valuable opportunity where the overlay cyber network can cure failures in the underlying physical network. To capture both self-healing and contagion, we introduce a factor graph representation of inter-dependent cyber-physical systems in which factor nodes represent various node functionalities and the edges capture the interactions between the nodes. We develop a message passing algorithm to study the dynamics of failure propagation and healing in this representation. Through applying a fixed-point analysis to this algorithm, we investigate the network reaction to initial disruptions. Our analysis provides simple yet critical guidelines for choosing network parameters to achieve resiliency against cascading failures.",

      "abstract": "Healing of soft biological tissue is the process of self-recovering or self-repairing the injured or damaged extracellular matrix (ECM). Healing is assumed to be stress-driven, with the objective of returning to a homeostatic stress metrics in the tissue after replacing the damaged ECM with new undamaged one. However, based on the existence of intrinsic length-scales in soft tissues, it is thought that computational models of healing should be non-local. In the present study, we introduce for the first time two gradient-enhanced con-stitutive healing models for soft tissues including non-local variables. The first model combines a continuum damage model with a temporally homogenized growth model, where the growth direction is determined according to local principal stress directions. The second one is based on a gradient-enhanced healing model with continuously recoverable damage variable. Both models are implemented in the finite-element package Abaqus by means of a user sub-routine UEL. Three two-dimensional situations simulating the healing process of soft tissues are modeled numerically with both models, and their application for simulation of balloon angioplasty is provided by illustrating the change of damage field and geometry in the media layer throughout the healing process.",

      "abstract": "Interdependent networks are characterized by two kinds of interactions: The usual connectivity links within each network and the dependency links coupling nodes of different networks. Due to the latter links such networks are known to suffer from cascading failures and catastrophic breakdowns. When modeling these phenomena, usually one assumes that a fraction of nodes gets damaged in one of the networks, which is followed possibly by a cascade of failures. In real life the initiating failures do not occur at once and effort is made replace the ties eliminated due to the failing nodes. Here we study a dynamic extension of the model of interdependent networks and introduce the possibility of link formation with a probability w, called healing, to bridge non-functioning nodes and enhance network resilience. A single random node is removed, which may initiate an avalanche. After each removal step healing sets in resulting in a new topology. Then a new node fails and the process continues until the giant component disappears either in a catastrophic breakdown or in a smooth transition. Simulation results are presented for square lattices as starting networks under random attacks of constant intensity. We find that the shift in the position of the breakdown has a power-law scaling as a function of the healing probability with an exponent close to 1. Below a critical healing probability, catastrophic cascades form and the average degree of surviving nodes decreases monotonically, while above this value there are no macroscopic cascades and the average degree has first an increasing character and decreases only at the very late stage of the process. These findings facilitate to plan intervention in case of crisis situation by describing the efficiency of healing efforts needed to suppress cascading failures.",

In this case report, we present a treatment option for a chronic gastric fistula following LSG, performed as a salvage treatment after the failure of several conservative management techniques. We also reviewed the literature to contextualize our case within the spectrum of treatment strategies for refractory fistulas.<h4>Patient concerns</h4>A 45-year-old woman underwent LSG 7 days prior to presentation. The patient presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain and fever.<h4>Diagnoses</h4>She was diagnosed with a gastric leak following LSG.<h4>Interventions</h4>The patient underwent an emergency surgery for generalized peritonitis and hemodynamic instability, during which multiple drains were placed in the abdomen. Furthermore, the patient was managed conservatively, including endoscopic vacuum therapy for 3 months.<h4>Outcomes</h4>The leakage persisted despite these interventions. Complete total gastrectomy was performed 3 months later, and the patient was discharged 27 days after the surgery.<h4>Lessons</h4>If conservative treatments fail to resolve leakage, delayed total gastrectomy should be considered as a definitive treatment option for refractory leaks.",

When using anlotinib to treat non-small cell lung cancer, clinicians need to monitor changes in patients' symptoms closely.

However, postoperative pancreatic fistula(POPF) is the most intractable complication causing relevant mortality. Moreover, pancreatic juice may exude from the wound that would lead to more serious complications. Tapering pressure of wall vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy is considered one of the best treatment to wound exudation. Here, we report on a single center series of 5 POPF cases accompanying wound exudation following open or Laparoscopic-assisted pancreatoduodenectomy, successfully managed by VAC.<h4>Methods</h4>We enrolled all patients who experienced POPF ensuing wound exudation following open or Laparoscopic-assisted pancreatoduodenectomy (OPD or LAPD) and received tapering pressure of vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy between July 2017 and August 2024. For VAC, we utilized wall suction device devised by our center applying the technique of negative pressure wound therapy(NPWT). And we adjusted the tapering pressure of the abdominal wound wall vacuum which fixed to a 8Fr or 12Fr suction catheter and connected to the pressure regulator between -50 and -100 mmHg according to the wound exudation amount. When the amount of the wound exudation were less than 100 ml, the wall vacuum suction catheter could be connected to the negative pressure balloon so that the patients could be able to get out of bed. The wall vacuum of VAC was removed when the pancreatic fistula had sufficiently healed which resulting in complete wound healing.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 60 patients underwent OPD or LAPD. Among them, 9 had occured clinically related pancreatic fistulaI(CR-POPF)according to International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula grade (POPF; 30%). one of the 3 grade C patients underwent Re-laparotomy due to the completely separated pancreaticojejunostomy and postoperative hemorrhage. 5 of the 6 grade B patients was performed tapering pressure of wall vacuum-assisted closure therapy for pancreatic juice exudation from the wound, and all of these patients had good outcomes by this VAC therapy.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Tapering pressure of wall VAC therapy could be a safe and effective treatment in the management of POPF ensuing wound exudation following open or Laparoscopic-assisted pancreatoduodenectomy.

      "abstract": "Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is now regarded as the gold standard for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, PET imaging can be prohibitive in terms of cost and planning, and is also among the imaging techniques with the highest dosage of radiation. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), in contrast, is more widely available and provides more flexibility when setting the desired image resolution. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of AD using MRI is difficult due to the very subtle physiological differences between healthy and AD subjects visible on MRI. As a result, many attempts have been made to synthesize PET images from MR images using generative adversarial networks (GANs) in the interest of enabling the diagnosis of AD from MR. Existing work on PET synthesis from MRI has largely focused on Conditional GANs, where MR images are used to generate PET images and subsequently used for AD diagnosis. There is no end-to-end training goal. This paper proposes an alternative approach to the aforementioned, where AD diagnosis is incorporated in the GAN training objective to achieve the best AD classification performance. Different GAN lossesare fine-tuned based on the discriminator performance, and the overall training is stabilized. The proposed network architecture and training regime show state-of-the-art performance for three- and four- class AD classification tasks.",

We focus on the case in which subgroup-specific models may be expected to be similar but not necessarily identical. Our approach is to treat subgroups as related problem instances and jointly estimate subgroup-specific regression coefficients. This is done in a penalized framework, combining an $\\ell_1$ term with an additional term that penalizes differences between subgroup-specific coefficients. This gives solutions that are globally sparse but that allow information-sharing between the subgroups. We present algorithms for estimation and empirical results on simulated data and using Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and cancer datasets.

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is one of the most concerned neurodegenerative diseases. In the last decade, studies on AD diagnosis attached great significance to artificial intelligence (AI)-based diagnostic algorithms. Among the diverse modality imaging data, T1-weighted MRI and 18F-FDGPET are widely researched for this task. In this paper, we propose a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) to fuse the multi-modality information including T1-MRI and FDG-PDT images around the hippocampal area for the diagnosis of AD. Different from the traditional machine learning algorithms, this method does not require manually extracted features, and utilizes the stateof-art 3D image-processing CNNs to learn features for the diagnosis and prognosis of AD. To validate the performance of the proposed network, we trained the classifier with paired T1-MRI and FDG-PET images using the ADNI datasets, including 731 Normal (NL) subjects, 647 AD subjects, 441 stable MCI (sMCI) subjects and 326 progressive MCI (pMCI) subjects. We obtained the maximal accuracies of 90.10% for NL/AD task, 87.46% for NL/pMCI task, and 76.90% for sMCI/pMCI task. The proposed framework yields comparative results against state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, the experimental results have demonstrated that (1) segmentation is not a prerequisite by using CNN, (2) the hippocampal area provides enough information to give a reference to AD diagnosis.

      "doi": "",
      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prominent, worldwide, age-related neurodegenerative disease that currently has no systemic treatment. Strong evidence suggests that permeable amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) oligomers, astrogliosis and reactive astrocytosis cause neuronal damage in AD. A large amount of Abeta is secreted by astrocytes, which contributes to the total Abeta deposition in the brain. This suggests that astrocytes may also play a role in AD, leading to increased attention to their dynamics and associated mechanisms. Therefore, in the present study, we developed and evaluated novel stochastic models for Abeta growth using ADNI data to predict the effect of astrocytes on AD progression in a clinical trial. In the AD case, accurate prediction is required for a successful clinical treatment plan. Given that AD studies are observational in nature and involve routine patient visits, stochastic models provide a suitable framework for modelling AD. Using the approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach, the AD etiology may be modelled as a multi-state disease process. As a result, we use this approach to examine the weak and strong influence of astrocytes at multiple disease progression stages using ADNI data from the baseline to 2-year visits for AD patients whose ages ranged from 50 to 90 years. Based on ADNI data, we discovered that the strong astrocyte effect (i.e., a higher concentration of astrocytes as compared to Abeta) could help to lower or clear the growth of Abeta, which is a key to slowing down AD progression.",

Patient and public involvement is essential for aligning research with patient priorities. This study aimed to gather patient perspectives on the use of MRI in pfCD.<h4>Methods</h4>A mixed-methods approach was used, following Guidance for Reporting Involvement of Patients and the Public (GRIPP2) guidelines. An online survey, co-developed with a patient representative, included open and closed questions on MRI experiences, advantages, challenges, and the potential for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated reports. This was followed by a virtual session for further exploration of patient views. Thematic analysis was conducted on the data.<h4>Results</h4>Forty-seven patients with Crohn's disease (37 with pfCD) from 6 countries participated, with 28/37 (76%) completing the survey. Key themes included patient expectations for MRI, preferences for scan intervals, and report content. Most (93%) wanted MRI reports to compare with previous scans, highlighting fistula changes and new abscesses. A majority (57%) preferred MRI scans annually when well, and more frequently after surgery (64.3% preferred scans at 3 months). Emotional relief was associated with MRI improvements, though access to services and report clarity remained challenging. Interest in AI-generated reports was expressed if clearly explained and validated by professionals.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This is the first study exploring patient views on MRI use in pfCD, emphasizing the need for patient-centred MRI reporting and clearer communication. Future work should enhance patient access and validate AI-generated MRI reports.",

      "abstract": "The semantic segmentation of pelvic organs via MRI has important clinical significance. Recently, deep learning-enabled semantic segmentation has facilitated the three-dimensional geometric reconstruction of pelvic floor organs, providing clinicians with accurate and intuitive diagnostic results. However, the task of labeling pelvic floor MRI segmentation, typically performed by clinicians, is labor-intensive and costly, leading to a scarcity of labels. Insufficient segmentation labels limit the precise segmentation and reconstruction of pelvic floor organs. To address these issues, we propose a semi-supervised framework for pelvic organ segmentation. The implementation of this framework comprises two stages. In the first stage, it performs self-supervised pre-training using image restoration tasks. Subsequently, fine-tuning of the self-supervised model is performed, using labeled data to train the segmentation model. In the second stage, the self-supervised segmentation model is used to generate pseudo labels for unlabeled data. Ultimately, both labeled and unlabeled data are utilized in semi-supervised training. Upon evaluation, our method significantly enhances the performance in the semantic segmentation and geometric reconstruction of pelvic organs, Dice coefficient can increase by 2.65% averagely. Especially for organs that are difficult to segment, such as the uterus, the accuracy of semantic segmentation can be improved by up to 3.70%.",

Overall, results show that while current methods are imperfect, they have major utility for research and clinical applications.

Performance is particularly strong for clinical pathogenic variants, including some difficult-to-diagnose cases, and extends to interpretation of cancer-related variants.

      "abstract": "Results of the first comprehensive light pollution survey in Hong Kong are presented. The night-sky brightness was measured and monitored around the city using a portable light sensing device called the Sky Quality Meter over a 15-month period beginning in March 2008. A total of 1,957 data sets were taken at 199 distinct locations, including urban and rural sites covering all 18 Administrative Districts of Hong Kong. The survey shows that the environmental light pollution problem in Hong Kong is severe - the urban night-skies (sky brightness at 15.0 mag per arcsec square) are on average ~100 times brighter than at the darkest rural sites (20.1 mag per arcsec square), indicating that the high lighting densities in the densely populated residential and commercial areas lead to light pollution. In the worst polluted urban location studied, the night-sky at 13.2 mag per arcsec square can be over 500 times brighter than the darkest sites in Hong Kong. The observed night-sky brightness is found to be affected by human factors such as land utilization and population density of the observation sites, together with meteorological and/or environmental factors. Moreover, earlier night-skies (at 9:30pm local time) are generally brighter than later time (at 11:30pm), which can be attributed to some public and commercial lightings being turned off later at night. On the other hand, no concrete relationship between the observed sky brightness and air pollutant concentrations could be established with the limited survey sampling. Results from this survey will serve as an important database for the public to assess whether new rules and regulations are necessary to control the use of outdoor lightings in Hong Kong.",

The resultant evidential models can quantify fine-grained uncertainty using the learned evidence. To ensure theoretically sound evidential models, the evidence needs to be non-negative, which requires special activation functions for model training and inference. This constraint often leads to inferior predictive performance compared to standard softmax models, making it challenging to extend them to many large-scale datasets. To unveil the real cause of this undesired behavior, we theoretically investigate evidential models and identify a fundamental limitation that explains the inferior performance: existing evidential activation functions create zero evidence regions, which prevent the model to learn from training samples falling into such regions. A deeper analysis of evidential activation functions based on our theoretical underpinning inspires the design of a novel regularizer that effectively alleviates this fundamental limitation. Extensive experiments over many challenging real-world datasets and settings confirm our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.",

In this paper, we explore what these models are learning about malware. To do so, we examine the learned features at multiple levels of resolution, from individual byte embeddings to end-to-end analysis of the model. At each step, we connect these byte-oriented activations to their original semantics through parsing and disassembly of the binary to arrive at human-understandable features. Through our results, we identify several interesting features learned by the model and their connection to manually-derived features typically used by traditional machine learning models. Additionally, we explore the impact of training data volume and regularization on the quality of the learned features and the efficacy of the classifiers, revealing the somewhat paradoxical insight that better generalization does not necessarily result in better performance for byte-based malware classifiers.",

      "abstract": "Recently, there is a vast interest in developing image feature learning methods that are independent of the training data, such as deep image prior, InGAN, SinGAN, and DCIL. These methods are unsupervised and are used to perform low-level vision tasks such as image restoration, image editing, and image synthesis. In this work, we proposed a new training data-independent framework, called Deep Contextual Features Learning (DeepCFL), to perform image synthesis and image restoration based on the semantics of the input image. The contextual features are simply the high dimensional vectors representing the semantics of the given image. DeepCFL is a single image GAN framework that learns the distribution of the context vectors from the input image. We show the performance of contextual learning in various challenging scenarios: outpainting, inpainting, and restoration of randomly removed pixels. DeepCFL is applicable when the input source image and the generated target image are not aligned. We illustrate image synthesis using DeepCFL for the task of image resizing.",

      "doi": "",
      "abstract": "The recent advances in deep learning (DL) have been accelerated by access to large-scale data and compute. These large-scale resources have been used to train progressively larger models which are resource intensive in terms of compute, data, energy, and carbon emissions. These costs are becoming a new type of entry barrier to researchers and practitioners with limited access to resources at such scale, particularly in the Global South. In this work, we take a comprehensive look at the landscape of existing DL models for medical image analysis tasks and demonstrate their usefulness in settings where resources are limited. To account for the resource consumption of DL models, we introduce a novel measure to estimate the performance per resource unit, which we call the PePR score. Using a diverse family of 131 unique DL architectures (spanning 1M to 130M trainable parameters) and three medical image datasets, we capture trends about the performance-resource trade-offs. In applications like medical image analysis, we argue that small-scale, specialized models are better than striving for large-scale models. Furthermore, we show that using existing pretrained models that are fine-tuned on new data can significantly reduce the computational resources and data required compared to training models from scratch. We hope this work will encourage the community to focus on improving AI equity by developing methods and models with smaller resource footprints.",

      "abstract": "Gastrointestinal Tuberculosis (GITB) and Crohn's disease (CD) are both chronic granulomatous diseases with a predilection to involve primarily the terminal ileum. GITB is often considered a disease of the developing world, while CD and inflammatory bowel disease are considered a disease of the developed world. But in recent times, the epidemiology of both diseases has changed. Differentiating GITB from CD is of immense clinical importance as the management of both diseases differs. While GITB needs anti-tubercular therapy (ATT), CD needs immunosuppressive therapy. Misdiagnosis or a delay in diagnosis can lead to catastrophic consequences. Most of the clinical features, endoscopic findings, and imaging features are not pathognomonic for either of these two conditions. The definitive diagnosis of GITB can be clinched only in a fraction of cases with microbiological positivity (acid-fast bacilli, mycobacterial culture, or PCR-based tests). In most cases, the diagnosis is often based on consistent clinical, endoscopic, imaging, and histological findings. Similarly, no single finding can conclusively diagnose CD. Multiparametric-based predictive models incorporating clinical, endoscopy findings, histology, radiology, and serology have been used to differentiate GITB from CD with varied results. However, it is limited by the lack of validation studies for most such models. Many patients, especially in TB endemic regions, are initiated on a trial of ATT to see for an objective response to therapy. Early mucosal response assessed at two months is an objective marker of response to ATT. Prolonged ATT in CD is recognized to have a fibrotic effect. Therefore, early discrimination may be vital in preventing the delay in the diagnosis of CD and avoiding a complicated course.",

In this study, we extract intensity, volume, and texture features from the tumor subregions to identify the correlations with gene expression features and overall survival. Consequently, we utilize the radiomics to find associations with the subtypes of glioblastoma. Accordingly, the fractal dimensions of the whole tumor, tumor core, and necrosis regions show a significant difference between the Proneural, Classical and Mesenchymal subtypes.

      "abstract": "Multiparametric radiological imaging is vital for detection, characterization and diagnosis of many different diseases. The use of radiomics for quantitative extraction of textural features from radiological imaging is increasing moving towards clinical decision support. However, current methods in radiomics are limited to using single images for the extraction of these textural features and may limit the applicable scope of radiomics in different clinical settings. Thus, in the current form, they are not capable of capturing the true underlying tissue characteristics in high dimensional multiparametric imaging space. To overcome this challenge, we have developed a multiparametric imaging radiomic framework termed MPRAD for extraction of radiomic features from high dimensional datasets. MPRAD was tested on two different organs and diseases; breast cancer and cerebrovascular accidents in brain, commonly referred to as stroke. The MPRAD framework classified malignant from benign breast lesions with excellent sensitivity and specificity of 87% and 80.5% respectively with an AUC of 0.88 providing a 9%-28% increase in AUC over single radiomic parameters. More importantly, in breast, the glandular tissue MPRAD were similar between each group with no significance differences. Similarly, the MPRAD features in brain stroke demonstrated increased performance in distinguishing the perfusion-diffusion mismatch compared to single parameter radiomics and there were no differences within the white and gray matter tissue. In conclusion, we have introduced the use of multiparametric radiomics into a clinical setting",

      "abstract": "While lung cancer is the second most diagnosed form of cancer in men and women, a sufficiently early diagnosis can be pivotal in patient survival rates. Imaging-based, or radiomics-driven, detection methods have been developed to aid diagnosticians, but largely rely on hand-crafted features which may not fully encapsulate the differences between cancerous and healthy tissue. Recently, the concept of discovery radiomics was introduced, where custom abstract features are discovered from readily available imaging data. We propose a novel evolutionary deep radiomic sequencer discovery approach based on evolutionary deep intelligence. Motivated by patient privacy concerns and the idea of operational artificial intelligence, the evolutionary deep radiomic sequencer discovery approach organically evolves increasingly more efficient deep radiomic sequencers that produce significantly more compact yet similarly descriptive radiomic sequences over multiple generations. As a result, this framework improves operational efficiency and enables diagnosis to be run locally at the radiologist's computer while maintaining detection accuracy. We evaluated the evolved deep radiomic sequencer (EDRS) discovered via the proposed evolutionary deep radiomic sequencer discovery framework against state-of-the-art radiomics-driven and discovery radiomics methods using clinical lung CT data with pathologically-proven diagnostic data from the LIDC-IDRI dataset. The evolved deep radiomic sequencer shows improved sensitivity (93.42%), specificity (82.39%), and diagnostic accuracy (88.78%) relative to previous radiomics approaches.",

      "abstract": "Treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) represents, in the majority of cases, a real challenge to the gastroenterologist's abilities and skills as well as a clinical test concerning his/her levels of medical knowledge and experience. During the last two decades, our pharmaceutical arsenal was significantly strengthened, especially after the introduction of the so-called biological agents, drugs which to a large extent not only improved the results of conservative treatment but also changed the natural history of the disease. However, colectomy is still necessary for some patients with severe UC although smaller compared to the past, precisely because of the improvements achieved in the available conservative treatment. Nevertheless, surgeries to treat colon dysplasia and cancer are increasing to some extent. At the same time, satisfactory improvements in surgical techniques, the pre-and post-operative care of patients, as well as the selection of the appropriate time for performing the surgery have been noticed. Regarding patients with CD, the improvement of conservative treatment did not significantly change the need for surgical treatment since two-thirds of patients need to undergo surgery at some point in the course of their disease. On the other hand, the outcome of the operation has improved through good preoperative care as well as the wide application of more conservative surgical techniques aimed at keeping as much of the bowel <i>in situ</i> as possible. This article discusses the indications for surgical management of UC patients from the gastroenterologist's point of view, the results of the emerging new techniques such as transanal surgery and robotics, as well as alternative operations to the classic ileo-anal-pouch anastomosis. The author also discusses the basic principles of surgical management of patients with CD based on the results of the relevant literature. The self-evident is emphasized, that is, to achieve an excellent therapeutic result in patients with severe inflammatory bowel disease in today's era; the close cooperation of gastroenterologists with surgeons, pathologists, imaging, and nutritionists is of paramount importance.",

In particular, changes in data sources are inevitable to occur and pose significant risks that are crucial to address in the context of machine learning for official statistics.   This paper gives an overview of the main risks, liabilities, and uncertainties associated with changing data sources in the context of machine learning for official statistics. We provide a checklist of the most prevalent origins and causes of changing data sources; not only on a technical level but also regarding ownership, ethics, regulation, and public perception. Next, we highlight the repercussions of changing data sources on statistical reporting. These include technical effects such as concept drift, bias, availability, validity, accuracy and completeness, but also the neutrality and potential discontinuation of the statistical offering. We offer a few important precautionary measures, such as enhancing robustness in both data sourcing and statistical techniques, and thorough monitoring.

For instance, learning curves can be used to model the performance of the combination of an algorithm and its hyperparameter configuration, providing insights into their potential suitability at an early stage and often expediting the algorithm selection process. Various learning curve models have been proposed to use learning curves for decision making. Some of these models answer the binary decision question of whether a given algorithm at a certain budget will outperform a certain reference performance, whereas more complex models predict the entire learning curve of an algorithm. We contribute a framework that categorises learning curve approaches using three criteria: the decision-making situation they address, the intrinsic learning curve question they answer and the type of resources they use.

      "abstract": "Online active learning is a paradigm in machine learning that aims to select the most informative data points to label from a data stream. The problem of minimizing the cost associated with collecting labeled observations has gained a lot of attention in recent years, particularly in real-world applications where data is only available in an unlabeled form. Annotating each observation can be time-consuming and costly, making it difficult to obtain large amounts of labeled data. To overcome this issue, many active learning strategies have been proposed in the last decades, aiming to select the most informative observations for labeling in order to improve the performance of machine learning models. These approaches can be broadly divided into two categories: static pool-based and stream-based active learning. Pool-based active learning involves selecting a subset of observations from a closed pool of unlabeled data, and it has been the focus of many surveys and literature reviews. However, the growing availability of data streams has led to an increase in the number of approaches that focus on online active learning, which involves continuously selecting and labeling observations as they arrive in a stream. This work aims to provide an overview of the most recently proposed approaches for selecting the most informative observations from data streams in real time.

By identifying conserved weights within groups of minima of the loss landscapes, we can identify the drivers of model decision making. Analogues to this idea exist in the molecular sciences, where coordinate invariants or order parameters are employed to identify critical features of a molecule.

We explored a number of advanced pre-trained language models for fake news detection along with the traditional and deep learning ones and compared their performances from different aspects for the first time to the best of our knowledge. We find that BERT and similar pre-trained models perform the best for fake news detection, especially with very small dataset. Hence, these models are significantly better option for languages with limited electronic contents, i.e., training data.

The survey focuses on agent/robot emotions, and mostly ignores human user emotions. Emotions are recognized as functional in decision-making by influencing motivation and action selection. Therefore, computational emotion models are usually grounded in the agent's decision making architecture, of which RL is an important subclass. Studying emotions in RL-based agents is useful for three research fields. For machine learning (ML) researchers, emotion models may improve learning efficiency. For the interactive ML and human-robot interaction (HRI) community, emotions can communicate state and enhance user investment. Lastly, it allows affective modelling (AM) researchers to investigate their emotion theories in a successful AI agent class. This survey provides background on emotion theory and RL. It systematically addresses 1) from what underlying dimensions (e.g., homeostasis, appraisal) emotions can be derived and how these can be modelled in RL-agents, 2) what types of emotions have been derived from these dimensions, and 3) how these emotions may either influence the learning efficiency of the agent or be useful as social signals. We also systematically compare evaluation criteria, and draw connections to important RL sub-domains like (intrinsic) motivation and model-based RL. In short, this survey provides both a practical overview for engineers wanting to implement emotions in their RL agents, and identifies challenges and directions for future emotion-RL research.",

Methods: This paper presents the first complete method for automatically explaining results for any machine learning predictive model without degrading accuracy. We did a computer coding implementation of the method. Using the electronic medical record data set from the Practice Fusion diabetes classification competition containing patient records from all 50 states in the United States, we demonstrated the method on predicting type 2 diabetes diagnosis within the next year. Results: For the champion machine learning model of the competition, our method explained prediction results for 87.4% of patients who were correctly predicted by the model to have type 2 diabetes diagnosis within the next year.

      "abstract": "This research paper delves into the innovative integration of Shannon entropy and rough set theory, presenting a novel approach to generalize the evaluation approach in machine learning. The conventional application of entropy, primarily focused on information uncertainty, is extended through its combination with rough set theory to offer a deeper insight into data's intrinsic structure and the interpretability of machine learning models. We introduce a comprehensive framework that synergizes the granularity of rough set theory with the uncertainty quantification of Shannon entropy, applied across a spectrum of machine learning algorithms. Our methodology is rigorously tested on various datasets, showcasing its capability to not only assess predictive performance but also to illuminate the underlying data complexity and model robustness. The results underscore the utility of this integrated approach in enhancing the evaluation landscape of machine learning, offering a multi-faceted perspective that balances accuracy with a profound understanding of data attributes and model dynamics. This paper contributes a groundbreaking perspective to machine learning evaluation, proposing a method that encapsulates a holistic view of model performance, thereby facilitating more informed decision-making in model selection and application.",

      "abstract": "Liver diseases are a major global health burden, responsible for nearly two million deaths worldwide each year. Despite advances in imaging, serology, and non-invasive fibrosis assessment, late-stage diagnosis persists, limiting curative interventions. Artificial intelligence (AI) and digital biomarkers promise to transform hepatology by enhancing early detection, risk stratification, and remote monitoring. This review provides a critical synthesis of recent evidence in AI-driven imaging, digital histopathology, predictive modeling using electronic health records (EHR), and wearable-based phenotyping. We compare and analyze the strengths and limitations of landmark AI models, highlight real-world implementation barriers such as algorithmic bias and data privacy, and explore emerging paradigms such as federated learning and multimodal integration. While AI tools consistently outperform conventional scores (e.g., Model for End-Stage Liver Disease [MELD]) in predictive accuracy, their clinical adoption remains limited by regulatory, ethical, and validation challenges. In the future, hepatology will require equitable AI systems trained on diverse datasets, integration into electronic medical record (EMR) workflows, and patient-centered digital health platforms. Establishing global AI liver disease registries and multicenter validation trials will be critical to ensure equitable and scalable clinical adoption.",

      "abstract": "Hepatology encompasses various aspects, such as metabolic-associated fatty liver disease, viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, liver cirrhosis, liver failure, liver tumors, and liver transplantation. The global epidemiological situation of liver diseases is grave, posing a substantial threat to human health and quality of life. Characterized by high incidence and mortality rates, liver diseases have emerged as a prominent global public health concern. In recent years, the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning, and radiomics has transformed medical research and clinical practice, demonstrating considerable potential in hepatology. AI is capable of automatically detecting abnormal cells in liver tissue sections, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of pathological diagnosis. Deep learning models are able to extract features from computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging images to facilitate liver disease classification. Machine learning models are capable of integrating clinical data to forecast disease progression and treatment responses, thus supporting clinical decision-making for personalized medicine. Through the analysis of imaging data, laboratory results, and genomic information, AI can assist in diagnosis, forecast disease progression, and optimize treatment plans, thereby improving clinical outcomes for liver disease patients. This minireview intends to comprehensively summarize the state-of-the-art theories and applications of AI in hepatology, explore the opportunities and challenges it presents in clinical practice, basic research, and translational medicine, and propose future research directions to guide the advancement of hepatology and ultimately improve patient outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Online Automated Privacy Policy Generators (APPGs) are tools used by app developers to quickly create app privacy policies which are required by privacy regulations to be incorporated to each mobile app. The creation of these tools brings convenience to app developers; however, the quality of these tools puts developers and stakeholders at legal risk. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to assess the quality of online APPGs. We analyze the completeness of privacy policies, determine what categories and items should be covered in a complete privacy policy, and conduct APPG assessment with boilerplate apps. The results of assessment show that due to the lack of static or dynamic analysis of app's behavior, developers may encounter two types of issues caused by APPGs. First, the generated policies could be incomplete because they do not cover all the essential items required by a privacy policy. Second, some generated privacy policies contain unnecessary personal information collection or arbitrary commitments inconsistent with user input. Ultimately, the defects of APPGs may potentially lead to serious legal issues. We hope that the results and insights developed in this paper can motivate the healthy and ethical development of APPGs towards generating a more complete, accurate, and robust privacy policy.",

      "abstract": "Important decisions that impact human lives, livelihoods, and the natural environment are increasingly being automated. Delegating tasks to so-called automated decision-making systems (ADMS) can improve efficiency and enable new solutions. However, these benefits are coupled with ethical challenges. For example, ADMS may produce discriminatory outcomes, violate individual privacy, and undermine human self-determination. New governance mechanisms are thus needed that help organisations design and deploy ADMS in ways that are ethical, while enabling society to reap the full economic and social benefits of automation. In this article, we consider the feasibility and efficacy of ethics-based auditing (EBA) as a governance mechanism that allows organisations to validate claims made about their ADMS. Building on previous work, we define EBA as a structured process whereby an entity's present or past behaviour is assessed for consistency with relevant principles or norms. We then offer three contributions to the existing literature. First, we provide a theoretical explanation of how EBA can contribute to good governance by promoting procedural regularity and transparency. Second, we propose seven criteria for how to design and implement EBA procedures successfully. Third, we identify and discuss the conceptual, technical, social, economic, organisational, and institutional constraints associated with EBA. We conclude that EBA should be considered an integral component of multifaced approaches to managing the ethical risks posed by ADMS.",

Seven demonstrated a positive correlation between FC levels and MR enterography findings. Additionally, two studies reported significantly lower FC levels in ileal CD than in exclusive colonic or ileocolonic CD cases.

In this study, we evaluated the value of the parallel encoder network (PE-NET) method for the automated measurement of mesenteric vascular and portal vein parameters and explored the performance of PE-NET combined with support vector machine (SVM) classifier in CD diagnosis.<h4>Methods</h4>The automatic vascular segmentation model was trained using computed tomography enterography (CTE) imaging data from our hospital based on PE-NET. The segmentation performance of the trained model was evaluated using the sensitivity (SEN), the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), and the Average Hausdorff Distance (AHD). Then, the model was used for the automatic measurement of vascular parameters in the classification set, and machine learning classifier SVM was applied based on selected vessel features. The diagnosis performance of the PE-NET + SVM model was evaluated and compared with that of human radiologists and the clinical biomarkers [C-reactive protein (CRP) and fecal calprotectin (FCP)]. The impact of PE-NET + SVM on the reading time of radiologists was also evaluated.<h4>Results</h4>The segmentation dataset included the CTE data from 54 CD patients and 20 healthy controls. The classification dataset included the CTE data from 40 CD patients and 45 healthy controls. We found that PE-NET performed well in the vascular segmentation of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), portal vein (PV), and abdominal aorta (AA) in both validation sets and the testing set. Vascular parameters were automatically extracted by PE-NET. We found that the mesenteric artery, portal vein, abdominal aorta, and the ratio of portal vein to superior mesenteric artery or abdominal aorta were increased in the testing set, with no statistical difference between the automatic measurement obtained using PE-NET and the manual evaluation of CTE. Moreover, an support vector machine (SVM) classifier was applied for CD diagnosis based on the vascular parameters. The F1 scores indicated the comparable diagnostic ability of PE-NET + SVM to senior radiologists with over 10 years of experience, and the receiver operating curves (ROCs) revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) of PE-NET + SVM was 0.934, which was higher than those of clinical biomarkers such as FCP (AUC of 0.913) and CRP (AUC of 0.893), suggesting the great potential of PE-NET in aiding CD diagnosis. Additionally, the reading time of a junior radiologist on CTE images was significantly reduced and comparable to that of a senior radiologist with the help of PE-NET.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The PE-NET enables the automated measurement of mesenteric vascular and portal vein parameters and potentially assists the efficient diagnosis of CD.",

This review examines the role of AI in reducing diagnostic workload and enhancing efficiency across medical fields from January 2019 to February 2024, identifying limitations and areas for improvement. A comprehensive PubMed search using the keywords \"artificial intelligence\" or \"AI,\" \"efficiency\" or \"workload,\" and \"patient\" or \"clinical\" identified 2587 articles, of which 51 were reviewed. These studies analyzed the impact of AI on radiology, pathology, and other specialties, focusing on efficiency, accuracy, and workload reduction. The final 51 articles were categorized into 4 groups based on diagnostic efficiency, where category A included studies with supporting material provided, category B consisted of those with reduced data volume, category C focused on independent AI diagnosis, and category D included studies that reported data reduction without changes in diagnostic time. In radiology and pathology, which require skilled techniques and large-scale data processing, AI improved accuracy and reduced diagnostic time by approximately 90% or more. Radiology, in particular, showed a high proportion of category C studies, as digitized data and standardized protocols facilitated independent AI diagnoses.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown differences in brain function between patients with CD and healthy controls (HC). This study aimed to compare the neural correlates of anxiety inindividuals with CD relative to HC, using resting-state fMRI data.<h4>Methods</h4>Participants filled in the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), a validated tool for measuring anxiety, and underwent an MRI acquisition, including both structural and functional sequences, to identify brain regions associated with anxiety scores.<h4>Results</h4>Seventeen patients with CD and eighteen HC matched for age, education, and sex participated in the study. No significant group differences emerged in the STAI scores. However, resting-state fMRI analysis revealed distinct patterns of functional connectivity associated with anxiety scores for the two study groups. Among CD group, greater STAI scores correlated with increased functional connectivity, whereas, in HC, they correlated with decreased functional connectivity. Significant clusters were found in brain regions belonging to specific resting-state networks (RSNs): (a) Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC, within the Default Mode Network), (b) left Middle Frontal Gyrus (within the Left Fronto-Parietal Network), and (c) PCC and right Superior Temporal Gyrus (within the Dorsal Attention Network).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The differential association between functional connectivity and STAI scores observed for CD and HC participants was located in areas within self-referential (Default Mode Network) and cognitive (Left Fronto-Parietal Network and Dorsal Attention Network) RSNs. Our findings suggest that maladaptive/dysfunctional processing of negative emotions and visceral sensitivity may occur in patients with CD.",

This study quantified body composition and physical function alongside proton magnetic resonance imaging (1H MRI) and spectroscopy (31P MRS) measures of organ structure and function in quiescent Crohn's disease patients (CD) and healthy volunteers (HVs), to identify a physiological basis for IBD fatigue.<h4>Methods</h4>Body composition was determined using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and 1H MRI. Knee extensor isometric strength and isokinetic fatigue were measured using dynamometry. 1H MRI was used to quantify cardiac output, cerebral blood flow (gmCBF), and brain oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) at rest, and during supine, steady-state exercise, and recovery. 31P MRS was used to quantify post-exercise muscle phosphocreatine (PCr) resynthesis.<h4>Results</h4>Sixteen CD and 12 HV (age, sex, and BMI matched) were recruited. Fatigue perception was greater (13.9 ± 1 vs 8.3 ± 0.9, P = .001), and daily step count was less (5482 ± 684 vs 8168 ± 1123, P = .04) in CD. During steady-state exercise, gmCBF was less in CD (653 ± 30 vs 823 ± 40 mL/min, P = .003). Cardiac output and brain OEF were no different. Post-exercise PCr resynthesis was less in CD (17.2 ± 2.0 vs 25.3 ± 2.4 mM·min-1, P = .02). Body composition, isometric strength, and isokinetic fatigability were no different.<h4>Conclusions</h4>CD self-reported increased fatigue perception and exhibited a slower rate of post-exercise PCr resynthesis compared to HV. This occurred independently of changes in body composition, muscle strength, and fatigability. IBD fatigue may be linked to peripheral muscle deconditioning and lower gmCBF during submaximal exercise.",

      "abstract": "Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the spine and sacroiliac joints. This review discusses recent advances across multiple scientific fields that promise to transform axSpA management. Traditionally, axSpA was considered an immune-mediated disease driven by human leukocyte antigen B27 (HLA-B27), interleukin (IL)-23/IL-17 signaling, biomechanics, and dysbiosis. Diagnosis relies on clinical features, laboratory tests, and imaging, particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) nowadays. Management includes exercise, lifestyle changes, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and if this is not sufficient to achieve disease control also biological and targeted-synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. Beyond long-recognized genetic risks like HLA-B27, high-throughput sequencing has revealed intricate gene-environment interactions influencing dysbiosis, immune dysfunction, and aberrant bone remodeling. Elucidating these mechanisms promises screening approaches to enable early intervention. Advanced imaging is revolutionizing the assessment of axSpA's hallmark: sacroiliac bone-marrow edema indicating inflammation. Novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques sensitively quantify disease activity, while machine learning automates complex analysis to improve diagnostic accuracy and monitoring. Hybrid imaging like synthetic MRI/computed tomography (CT) visualizes structural damage with new clarity. Meanwhile, microbiome analysis has uncovered gut ecosystem alterations that may initiate joint inflammation through HLA-B27 misfolding or immune subversion. Correcting dysbiosis represents an enticing treatment target. Moving forward, emerging techniques must augment patient care. Incorporating patient perspectives will be key to ensure innovations like genetics, microbiome, and imaging biomarkers translate into improved mobility, reduced pain, and increased quality of life. By integrating cutting-edge, multidisciplinary science with patients' lived experience, researchers can unlock the full potential of new technologies to deliver transformative outcomes. The future is bright for precision diagnosis, tightly controlled treatment, and even prevention of axSpA.",

A novel mutation in nitric oxide synthase interacting protein (NOSIP) determined NO levels produced by human monocytes and was associated with disease severity in Sepsis patients. The study reveals NOSIP as an important regulator of inflammation by virtue of its ability to influence nitric oxide production both in mice and in humans and opens up novel avenues for therapeutic strategies against acute inflammation.

      "abstract": "BackgroundNumerous successful therapies developed for human medicine involve animal experimentation. Animal studies that are focused solely on translational potential, may not sufficiently document unexpected outcomes. Considerable amounts of data from such studies could be used to advance veterinary science. For example, sheep are increasingly being used as models of intensive care and therefore, data arising from such models must be published. In this study, the hypothesis is that there is little information describing cardiorespiratory physiological data from sheep models of intensive care and the author aimed to analyse such data to provide biological information that is currently not available for sheep that received extracorporeal life support (ECLS) following acute smoke-induced lung injury.\n\nMethodsNineteen mechanically ventilated adult ewes undergoing intensive care during evaluation of a form of ECLS (treatment) for acute lung injury were used to collate clinical observations. Eight sheep were injured by acute smoke inhalation prior to treatment (injured/treated), while another eight were not injured but treated (uninjured/treated). Two sheep were injured but not treated (injured/untreated), while one received room air instead of smoke as the injury and was not treated (placebo/untreated). The data were then analysed for 11 physiological categories and compared between the two treated groups.\n\nResultsCompared with the baseline, treatment contributed to and exacerbated the deterioration of pulmonary pathology by reducing lung compliance and the arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio. The oxygen extraction index changes mirrored those of the PaO2/FiO2 ratio. Decreasing coronary perfusion pressure predicted the severity of cardiopulmonary injury.\n\nConclusionsThese novel observations could help in understanding similar pathology such as that which occurs in animal victims of smoke inhalation from house or bush fires, aspiration pneumonia secondary to tick paralysis and in the management of the severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans.",

      "doi": "10.1101/062083",
      "abstract": "Alternative reproductive tactics and strategies (ARTS) refer to polymorphic reproductive behaviours in which in addition to the usual two sexes, there are one or more alternative morphs, usually male, that have evolved the ability to circumvent direct intra-sexual competition. Each morph has its own morphological, ecological, developmental, behavioural, life-history, and physiological profile that shifts the balance between reproduction and self-maintenance, one aspect being immunity. Immunoecological work on species with ARTS, which is the topic of this review, is particularly interesting because the alternative morphs make it possible to separate the effects of sex, per se, from other factors that in other species are inextricably linked with sex. We first summarize the evolution, development and maintenance of ARTS. We then review immunoecological hypotheses relevant to species with ARTS, dividing them into physiological, life-history, and ecological hypotheses. In context of these hypotheses, we critically review in detail all immunoecological studies we could find on species with ARTS. Several interesting patterns emerge. Oddly, there is a paucity of studies on insects, despite the many benefits that arise from working with insects: larger sample sizes, simple immune systems, and countless forms of alternative reproductive strategies and tactics. Of all the hypotheses considered, the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis has generated the greatest amount of work, but not necessarily the greatest level of understanding. Unfortunately, it is often used as a general guiding principle rather than a source of explicitly articulated predictions. Other hypotheses are usually considered a posteriori, but it is perhaps time that they take centre stage. Whereas blanket concepts such as \"immunocompetence\" and \"androgens\" might useful to develop a rationale, predictions need to be far more explicitly articulated. Integration so far has been a one-way street, with ecologists delving deeper into physiology, seemingly at the cost of ignoring their organisms evolutionary history and ecology. One possible useful framework is to divide ecological and evolutionary factors affecting immunity into those that stimulate the immune system, and those that depress it. Finally, the contributions of genomics to ecology are being increasingly recognized, including in species with ARTS, but we must ensure that evolutionary and ecological hypotheses drive the effort, as there is no grandeur in the strict reductionist view of life.",

Pathogens experience selection on traits at multiple scales, including replication rates within host individuals and transmissibility between hosts. We analyze a stochastic model linking pathogen growth and competition within individuals to transmission between individuals. Our analysis reveals a new factor, the cross-scale reproductive number of a mutant virion, that quantifies how quickly mutant strains increase in frequency when they initially appear in the infected host population. This cross-scale reproductive number combines with viral mutation rates, single-strain reproductive numbers, and transmission bottleneck width to determine the likelihood of evolutionary emergence, and whether evolution occurs swiftly or gradually within chains of transmission. We find that wider transmission bottlenecks facilitate emergence of pathogens with short-term infections, but hinder emergence of pathogens exhibiting cross-scale selective conflict and long-term infections. Our results provide a framework to advance the integration of laboratory, clinical and field data in the context of evolutionary theory, laying the foundation for a new generation of evidence-based risk assessment of emergence threats.",

      "abstract": "Functional Connectivity (FC) during resting-state or task conditions is not fixed but inherently dynamic. Yet, there is no consensus on whether fluctuations in FC may resemble isolated transitions between discrete FC states rather than continuous changes. This quarrel hampers advancing the study of dynamic FC. This is unfortunate as the structure of fluctuations in FC can certainly provide more information about developmental changes, aging, and progression of pathologies. We merge the two perspectives and consider dynamic FC as an ongoing network reconfiguration, including a stochastic exploration of the space of possible steady FC states. The statistical properties of this random walk deviate both from a purely \"order-driven\" dynamics, in which the mean FC is preserved, and from a purely \"randomness-driven\" scenario, in which fluctuations of FC remain uncorrelated over time. Instead, dynamic FC has a complex structure endowed with long-range sequential correlations that give rise to transient slowing and acceleration epochs in the continuous flow of reconfiguration. Our analysis for fMRI data in healthy elderly revealed that dynamic FC tends to slow down and becomes less complex as well as more random with increasing age. These effects appear to be strongly associated with age-related changes in behavioural and cognitive performance.\n\nHighlightsO_LIDynamic Functional Connectivity (dFC) at rest and during cognitive task performs a \"complex\" (anomalous) random walk.\nC_LIO_LISpeed of dFC slows down with aging.\nC_LIO_LIResting dFC replaces complexity by randomness with aging.\nC_LIO_LITask performance correlates with the speed and complexity of dFC.\nC_LI",

Although automation and other high-throughput techniques have led to an abundance of data enabling data-driven quantitative modeling and parameter estimation, the intense amount of simulation needed for these methods still frequently results in a computational bottleneck. Here we present bioscrape (Bio-circuit Stochastic Single-cell Reaction Analysis and Parameter Estimation) - a Python package for fast and flexible modeling and simulation of highly customizable chemical reaction networks. Specifically, bioscrape supports deterministic and stochastic simulations, which can incorporate delay, cell growth, and cell division. All functionalities - reaction models, simulation algorithms, cell growth models, partioning models, and Bayesian inference - are implemented as interfaces in an easily extensible and modular object-oriented framework. Models can be constructed via Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) or specified programmatically via a Python API. Simulation run times obtained with the package are comparable to those obtained using C code - this is particularly advantageous for computationally expensive applications such as Bayesian inference or simulation of cell lineages. We first show the packages simulation capabilities on a variety of example simulations of stochastic gene expression. We then further demonstrate the package by using it to do parameter inference on a model of integrase enzyme-mediated DNA recombination dynamics with experimental data.

      "abstract": "Part 1Development and calibration of suitably accurate functional assays for BRCA1 RING domain and BRCT domain missense substitutions could dramatically accelerate clinical classification of rare missense substitutions observed in that gene. Leveraging data from 68,000 full sequence tests of BRCA1 and BRCA2, plus data from the limited number of already classified BRCA1 RING domain missense substitutions, we used logistic regression and related techniques to evaluate three BRCA1 RING domain assays. These were recently described high throughput yeast 2-hybrid and E3 ubiquitin ligase assays, plus a newly developed mammalian 2-hybrid assay. While there were concerns about the accuracy of the yeast 2-hybrid assay and the indirect nature of the ubiquitin ligase assay, the mammalian 2-hybrid assay had excellent correlation with existing missense substitution classifications. After calibration, this assay contributed to classification of one newly reported BRCA1 missense substitution. In principal, the mammalian 2-hybrid assay could be converted to a high-throughput format that would likely retain suitable accuracy.\n\nPart 2How does one achieve clinically applicable classification of the vast majority of all possible sequence variants in disease susceptibility genes? BRCA1 is a high-risk susceptibility gene for breast and ovarian cancer. Pathogenic protein truncating variants are scattered across the open reading frame, but all known missense substitutions that are pathogenic because of missense dysfunction are located in either the amino-terminal RING domain or the carboxy-terminal BRCT domain. Heterodimerization of the BRCA1 and BARD1 RING domains is a molecularly defined obligate activity. Hence, we tested every BRCA1 RING domain missense substitution that can be created by a single nucleotide change for heterodimerization with BARD1 in a Mammalian 2-hybrid (M2H) assay. Downstream of the M2H laboratory assay, we addressed three additional challenges: assay calibration, validation thereof, and integration of the calibrated results with other available data such as computational evidence and patient/population observational data to achieve clinically applicable classification. Overall, we found that about 20% of BRCA1 RING domain missense substitutions are pathogenic. Using a Bayesian point system for data integration and variant classification, we achieved clinical classification of about 89% of observed missense substitutions. Moreover, among missense substitutions not present in the human observational data used here, we find an additional 47 with concordant computational and functional assay evidence in favor of pathogenicity; these are particularly likely to be classified as Likely Pathogenic once human observational data become available.",

      "abstract": "Individual-based models (IBMs) informing public health policy should be calibrated to data and provide estimates of uncertainty. Two main components of model-calibration methods are the parameter-search strategy and the goodness-of-fit (GOF) measure; many options exist for each of these. This review provides an overview of calibration methods used in IBMs modelling infectious disease spread.\n\nWe identified articles on PubMed employing simulation-based methods to calibrate IBMs informing public health policy in HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria epidemiology published between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2018. Articles were included if models stored individual-specific information, and calibration involved comparing model output to population-level targets. We extracted information on parameter-search strategies, GOF measures, and model validation.\n\nThe PubMed search identified 653 candidate articles, of which 84 met the review criteria. Of the included articles, 40 (48%) combined a quantitative GOF measure with an algorithmic parameter-search strategy - either an optimisation algorithm (14/40) or a sampling algorithm (26/40). These 40 articles varied widely in their choices of parameter-search strategies and GOF measures. For the remaining 44 (52%) articles, the parameter-search strategy could either not be identified (32/44) or was described as an informal, non-reproducible method (12/44). Of these 44 articles, the majority (25/44) were unclear about the GOF measure used; of the rest, only five quantitatively evaluated GOF. Only a minority of the included articles, 14 (17%) provided a rationale for their choice of model-calibration method. Model validation was reported in 31 (37%) articles.\n\nReporting on calibration methods is far from optimal in epidemiological modelling studies of HIV, malaria and TB transmission dynamics. The adoption of better documented, algorithmic calibration methods could improve both reproducibility and the quality of inference in model-based epidemiology. There is a need for research comparing the performance of calibration methods to inform decisions about the parameter-search strategies and GOF measures.\n\nAuthor summaryCalibration - that is, \"fitting\" the model to data - is a crucial part of using mathematical models to better forecast and control the population-level spread of infectious diseases. Evidence that the mathematical model is well-calibrated improves confidence that the model provides a realistic picture of the consequences of health policy decisions. To make informed decisions, Policymakers need information about uncertainty: i.e., what is the range of likely outcomes (rather than just a single prediction). Thus, modellers should also strive to provide accurate measurements of uncertainty, both for their model parameters and for their predictions. This systematic review provides an overview of the methods used to calibrate individual-based models (IBMs) of the spread of HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis. We found that less than half of the reviewed articles used reproducible, non-subjective calibration methods. For the remaining articles, the method could either not be identified or was described as an informal, non-reproducible method. Only one-third of the articles obtained estimates of parameter uncertainty. We conclude that the adoption of better-documented, algorithmic calibration methods could improve both reproducibility and the quality of inference in model-based epidemiology.",

In our clinical analysis of 2678 patients, splicing factor mutations showed inferior relapse-free and overall survival, however, these mutations did not represent independent prognostic markers. RNA-sequencing of 246 and independent validation in 177 patients revealed an isoform expression profile highly characteristic for each individual mutation, with several isoforms showing a strong dysregulation. By establishing a custom differential splice junction usage pipeline we accurately detected aberrant splicing in splicing factor mutated samples. Mutated samples were characterized predominantly by decreased junction usage. A large proportion of differentially used junctions were novel. Targets of splicing dysregulation included several genes with a known role in leukaemia. In SRSF2(P95H) mutants we further explored the possibility of a cascading effect through the dysregulation of the splicing pathway. We conclude that splicing factor mutations do not represent independent prognostic markers.

      "abstract": "Glucocorticoids--stress hormones released from the adrenal cortex--reduce phobic fear in anxiety disorders and enhance psychotherapy, possibly by reducing the retrieval of fear memories and enhancing the consolidation of new corrective memories. Glucocorticoid signaling in the basolateral amygdala can influence connected fear and memory-related cortical regions, but this is not fully understood. Previous studies investigated specific pathways moderated by glucocorticoids, for example, visual-temporal pathways; however, these analyses were limited to a-priori selected regions. Here, we performed whole-brain pattern analysis to localize phobic stimulus decoding related to the fear-reducing effect of glucocorticoids. We reanalyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from a previously published study with spider-phobic patients and healthy controls. The patients received either glucocorticoids or a placebo treatment before the exposure to spider images. There was moderate evidence that patients with phobia had higher decoding of phobic content in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the left and right anterior insula compared to controls. Decoding in the ACC and the right insula showed strong evidence for correlation with experienced fear. Patients with cortisol reported a reduction of fear by 10-13%; however, there was only weak evidence for changes in neural decoding compared to placebo which was found in the precuneus, the opercular cortex, and the left cerebellum.",

      "doi": "10.1101/043794",
      "abstract": "Transcription factors bind DNA in specific sequence contexts. In addition to distinguishing one nucleobase from another, some transcription factors can distinguish between unmodified and modified bases. Current models of transcription factor binding tend not take DNA modifications into account, while the recent few that do often have limitations. This makes a comprehensive and accurate profiling of transcription factor affinities difficult.\n\nHere, we developed methods to identify transcription factor binding sites in modified DNA. Our models expand the standard A/C/G/T DNA alphabet to include cytosine modifications. We developed Cytomod to create modified genomic sequences and enhanced the Multiple EM for Motif Elicitation (MEME) Suite by adding the capacity to handle custom alphabets. We adapted the well-established position weight matrix (PWM) model of transcription factor binding affinity to this expanded DNA alphabet.\n\nUsing these methods, we identified modification-sensitive transcription factor binding motifs. We confirmed established binding preferences, such as the preference of ZFP57 and C/EBP{beta} for methylated motifs and the preference of c-Myc for unmethylated E-box motifs. Using known binding preferences to tune model parameters, we discovered novel modified motifs for a wide array of transcription factors. Finally, we validated predicted binding preferences of OCT4 using cleavage under targets and release using nuclease (CUT&RUN) experiments across conventional, methylation-, and hydroxymethylation-enriched sequences. Our approach readily extends to other DNA modifications. As more genome-wide single-base resolution modification data becomes available, we expect that our method will yield insights into altered transcription factor binding affinities across many different modifications.",

      "doi": "10.1101/022459",
      "abstract": "Protein-RNA interactions (PRIs) are essential for many biological processes, so understanding aspects of the sequences and structures involved in PRIs is important for unraveling such processes. Because of the expensive and time-consuming techniques required for experimental determination of complex protein-RNA structures, various computational methods have been developed to predict PRIs. However, most of these methods focus on predicting only RNA-binding regions in proteins or only protein-binding motifs in RNA. Methods for predicting entire residue-base contacts in PRIs have not yet achieved sufficient accuracy. Furthermore, some of these methods require the identification of 3D structures or homologous sequences, which are not available for all protein and RNA sequences. Here, we propose a prediction method for predicting residue-base contacts between proteins and RNAs using only sequence information and structural information predicted from sequences. The method can be applied to any protein-RNA pair, even when rich information such as its 3D structure, is not available. In this method, residue-base contact prediction is formalized as an integer programming problem. We predict a residue-base contact map that maximizes a scoring function based on sequence-based features such as k-mers of sequences and the predicted secondary structure. The scoring function is trained using a max-margin framework from known PRIs with 3D structures. To verify our method, we conducted several computational experiments. The results suggest that our method, which is based on only sequence information, is comparable with RNA-binding residue prediction methods based on known binding data.",

      "doi": "10.1101/166306",
      "abstract": "Minimizing spatial uncertainty is essential for navigation, but the neural mechanisms remain elusive. Here we combine predictions of a simulated grid cell system with behavioural and fMRI measures in humans during virtual navigation. First, we showed that polarising cues produce anisotropy in motion parallax. Secondly, we simulated entorhinal grid cells in an environment with anisotropic information and found that self-location is decoded best when grid-patterns are aligned with the axis of greatest information. Thirdly, when exposing human participants to polarised virtual reality environments, we found that navigation performance is anisotropic, in line with the use of parallax. Eye movements showed that participants preferentially viewed polarising cues, which correlated with navigation performance. Finally, using fMRI we found that the orientation of grid-cell-like representations in entorhinal cortex anchored to the environmental axis of greatest parallax information, orthogonal to the polarisation axis. In sum, we demonstrate a crucial role of the entorhinal grid system in reducing uncertainty in representations of self-location and find evidence for adaptive spatial computations underlying entorhinal representations in service of optimal navigation.",
