**Fibrosis Summary:** {'pre_treatment_less_than_40_percent': 38, 'pre_treatment_less_than_40_percent_percentage': 79, 'post_treatment_100_percent_fibrotic_n': 14, 'post_treatment_100_percent_fibrotic_closed_n': 14, 'post_treatment_0_percent_fibrotic_open_n': 'All', 'post_treatment_60_percent_fibrotic_anti_tnf_closed_percentage': 67, 'post_treatment_60_percent_fibrotic_surgical_closed_percentage': 100}

### Correlations Found

- **MAGNIFI-CD index ↔ Long-term clinical closure**: r=None, type=ROC AUC
- **Degree of fibrosis ↔ Long-term clinical closure**: r=None, type=ROC AUC

### Tables with Scoring Data

- Table 1: VAI=False, MAGNIFI-CD=True
- Table 2: VAI=False, MAGNIFI-CD=True
- Table 3: VAI=False, MAGNIFI-CD=True

### Key Findings

- The study evaluates MAGNIFI-CD index and a novel 'degree of fibrosis' score (0-100%) for predicting long-term clinical closure.
- No direct comparison or crosswalk between Van Assche Index (VAI) and MAGNIFI-CD is provided.
- The MAGNIFI-CD index at post-treatment MRI had high accuracy (AUC 0.95) for predicting long-term closure.
- A cut-off point of MAGNIFI-CD index ≤6 predicts long-term clinical closure with 91% specificity and 87% sensitivity.
- A completely fibrotic tract (100% fibrosis) at post-treatment MRI was associated with long-term clinical closure in all 14 patients.
- The degree of fibrosis (0-100%) had an AUC of 0.90 for predicting long-term closure.
- Interobserver agreement for the MAGNIFI-CD index was 'almost perfect' (ICC 0.88).
- The study includes separate analyses for anti-TNF and surgical closure treatment groups.

### Supporting Evidence

> This study evaluated the predictive value of degree of fibrosis and disease activity (MAGNIFI-CD index) at MRI for long-term clinical closure of Crohn’s perianal fistulas.

> Two radiologists scored the degree of fibrosis and MAGNIFI-CD index at pre- and post-treatment MRI.

> Median MAGNIFI-CD index at post-treatment MRI was 0 [IQR 0–5] in 25 patients with long-term clinical closure and 16 [IQR 10-20] in 25 patients without.

> ROC analysis shows an AUC of 0.95 [95% CI: 0.89–1.00] accuracy in predicting long-term clinical closure. The Youden threshold to determine long-term clinical closure was a MAGNIFI-CD index of 6, with a 91% specificity and 87% sensitivity.

> All 14 patients who had a 100% fibrotic fistula at their post-treatment MRI showed long-term clinical closure.

## Radiological_Outcomes_Systematic_Review_2020.pdf

**Title:** Radiological outcomes in perianal fistulizing Crohn’s disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis

**Has paired VAI/MAGNIFI-CD scores:** No

### Tables with Scoring Data

- Table 1: VAI=False, MAGNIFI-CD=False
- Table 2: VAI=False, MAGNIFI-CD=False
- Table 3: VAI=False, MAGNIFI-CD=False

### Key Findings

- This is a systematic review of 9 studies (259 patients) reporting MRI outcomes in perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease treated with anti-TNFα therapy.
- The van Assche score was assessed in seven papers, with conflicting findings.
- There remains conflicting data regarding the significance of the van Assche score, particularly in real-world studies, as seen in our review.
- No direct mention of MAGNIFI-CD scoring system found in this paper.
- The paper discusses heterogeneity in definitions of radiological and clinical outcomes.
- The odds ratio of MRI healing versus clinical healing was 0.10 (95% CI, 0.02-0.39) in the short term and 0.43 (95% CI, 0.26-0.71) in the long term.

### Conversion Statements

> A universally accepted grading system for pfCD is therefore yet to be developed.

### Supporting Evidence

> Composite scores, such as the van Assche score, have been proposed, incorporating anatomical (number of tracts, location, presence/absence of levatoric extension) and inflammatory features (degree of T2 hyperintensity, presence/absence of collections, rectal wall involvement) as a marker of disease severity.

> The van Assche score was assessed in seven papers, with conflicting findings.

> There remains conflicting data regarding the significance of the van Assche score, particularly in real-world studies, as seen in our review.

> A universally accepted grading system for pfCD is therefore yet to be developed.

> The odds ratio of MRI healing versus clinical in the short term was 0.10 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.02-0.39) and in the long term was 0.43 (95% CI, 0.26-0.71).
